<p>A renegade Celestial. During the Second Host, the Dreaming Celestial committed a crime "against life itself" (which was originally thought to be the murder of another Celestial but in fact he had risen up against his brethren in order to get them to stop consuming the Deviants) and was <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/i/Exile.html" title="Exile">exiled</a> by his brethren. His spirit was ripped from his body and placed in a device known as the Vial, which was sealed under the <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/a/Diablo_Mountains_b87a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Diablo Mountains">Diablo Mountains</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> (<a href="../../../../articles/e/t/e/Eternals_%28comics%29.html" title="Eternals (comics)">Eternals</a> Limited #12). He slept there until the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/v/Deviant_%28comics%29.html" title="Deviant (comics)">Deviant</a> Priestlord <i>Ghaur</i> discovered the Vial and drank the essence of the Dreaming Celestial, giving him the height and power of a Celestial.

<dd>The Dreaming Celestial, while still trapped in his Diablo Mountain prison, sensed the rebirth of <i>Ghaur</i> and caused an Earthquake while tossing and turning uncontrollably in his "bed."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>After the events of <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Heroes_Reborn_3a72.html" title="Heroes Reborn">Heroes Reborn</a>, the Dreaming Celestial found a loophole out of his prison and into the Heroes Reborn Universe. There, he learned the Celestial <i>Ashema</i> guarded this Pocket Universe and that the only way out was through her. However, he found himself opposed by <a href="../../../../articles/d/r/2E/Dr._Doom_f490.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Dr. Doom">Dr. Doom</a>, Lancer, Technarx and several other heroes. Eventually The Dreaming Celestial captured Ashema and escaped to our Universe, where he was finally thwarted by Doom and <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Fantastic_Four_2a3b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="The Fantastic Four">The Fantastic Four</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He awoke again in an alternate future (as seen in <i>Fantastic Four</i> #339-340) and manipulated the hunger of a defenseless <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a> who was near death, into a weapon that would consume the entire Universe, enabling him to become the Nucleus and Founder of a new, darker reality.

<dd>It was recently revealed in Eternals #3 (the series by Neil Gaiman) that The Deviants planned to reawaken The Dreaming Celestial.

In Eternal #6, The Dreaming Celestial had awoken to its full glory and was to pass judgment on Earth (it was going to simply destroy the Earth but said that it was amused by humans for some unknown reason and decided to wait for an undefined time); it also seemed to have taking a "liking" to Iron Man â€” First appeared in <i>The Eternals</i> (1976 series) #18</dd>

<p>A young Celestial who was assigned to watch over Earth alongside <i>Gamiel the Manipulator</i>. The two were very competitive and nearly caused the destruction of Earth. Eventually he and Gamiel were reassigned to coordinate the first meeting between the <a href="../../../../articles/k/r/e/Kree.html" title="Kree">Kree</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/r/Skrull.html" title="Skrull">Skrull</a>... who go to war almost instantly after meeting each other.

<p>A young Celestial who, like <i>Devron</i>, was assigned to watch over Earth. He was disgusted that Devron's Little Folk had beaten back his creations: the Killer Folk so he brought the Hulk from the future and sent him down upon the Little Folk and their champion: <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/v/Devil_Dinosaur_d4f2.html" title="Devil Dinosaur">Devil Dinosaur</a>. Eventually he and Devron got in trouble and were reassigned to Hala where they accidentally set the Kree and the Skrull races into a four-million-year war against each other.

<p>This Celestial was the one who helped bring the baby "Blue" Celestial into this Universe.

<p>The first ever documented Celestial that was seen born. It was made from the genetic material of the Black Galaxy, a place where <a href="../../../../articles/e/g/o/Ego_the_Living_Planet_16c9.html" title="Ego the Living Planet">Ego the Living Planet</a>, snuffed out all of the stars and the genetic material of <a href="../../../../articles/e/r/i/Eric_Masterson_49df.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Eric Masterson">Eric Masterson</a> and Hercules. After leaving with the giant Celestial Host at the Black Galaxy it was encountered again by the <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/g/High_Evolutionary_56cc.html" title="High Evolutionary">High Evolutionary</a>, the Goddess Sif and the God <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/l/Balder_%28comics%29.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Balder (comics)">Balder</a>. Its duty was to keep Ego the Living Planet at bay while it and his brothers awaited the arrival of the awe-inspiring Super Ego. Once the creature appeared and crushed Ego, the Blue Celestial and its older brethren attacked the Super Ego with full force. However the High Evolutionary has suspicions that they are trying to help the Super Ego in some way... not destroy it. The Blue Celestial was never seen again after this Event.</p>
