<p>Reed was born in <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, the son of Charles Jerome and Margaret (Green) Reed. His mother was the daughter of a leading Portland citizen who had made a fortune in <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/g/Pig_iron.html" title="Pig iron">pig iron</a> manufacturing. His father, who had recently come from the <a href="../../../../articles/e/a/s/Eastern_United_States_f22b.html" title="Eastern United States">East</a> when they married in 1886, represented an agricultural machinery manufacturer and with his ready wit quickly won acceptance in Portland’s business community.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The young John, universally called Jack, was born in his mother’s mansion and baptized in the fashionable Trinity Episcopal Church (later abandoning religion).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> He grew up surrounded by nurses and servants, his upper-class playmates carefully selected. He had a brother, Harry, two years his junior.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> A sickly child, he was sent to the recently-established Portland Academy, a private boarding school where he was unhappy, at the age of nine.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> In September 1904, he was sent to <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/r/Morristown-Beard_School_038a.html" title="Morristown-Beard School">Morristown School</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, to prepare for college (his father had not gone to college and wanted his sons to attend Harvard).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> There, he made the football team and although he did poorly in most subjects, showed literary promise. Around this time his father’s social standing fell due to his <a href="../../../../articles/m/u/c/Muckraker.html" title="Muckraker">muckraking</a> activities in exposing the timber industry’s corruption.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reed entered <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harvard_College_b1fc.html" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> in September 1906 (passing the entrance examination on his second try – something he was allowed to do despite having earned a C in English, a D in history and <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, a pass in Chemistry, and failing <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and geometry).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Tall, handsome, and light-hearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team and the dramatic club; he served on the editorial boards of the <i><a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harvard_Lampoon_36b9.html" title="Harvard Lampoon">Lampoon</a></i> and the <i>Harvard Monthly</i>; he served as president of the <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harvard_Glee_Club_2d07.html" title="Harvard Glee Club">Harvard Glee Club</a>; he wrote a play produced by the <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/s/Hasty_Pudding_Club_1a74.html" title="Hasty Pudding Club">Hasty Pudding Club</a>, and was made ivy orator and poet. He attended meetings of the Socialist Club, which his friend <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/l/Walter_Lippmann_4d20.html" title="Walter Lippmann">Walter Lippmann</a> founded in May 1908, but never joined – his social conscience was still dormant and there were too many contradictions involved.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> He failed to make football and crew, but participated in low-prestige sports like swimming and water polo, at which he excelled.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> He was frustrated by the dismissive attitude the Eastern aristocracy showed the energetic young man, passing him over for membership in the waiting clubs (which one joined in preparation of the <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/n/Final_club.html" title="Final club">final clubs</a>) despite his having broken a friendship with a <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> classmate for the purpose of social advancement.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Still, his mentor, literature professor Charles Copeland, helped develop his talents.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Graduating in 1910, he visited <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> before moving to <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in March 1911.</p>

<p>He grew to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it; he enjoyed the independence he now had from his parents, from Portland (which he hated), and from Harvard snobbery. Although living in <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greenwich_Village_91fa.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>, he kept somewhat apart from its myriad intense, hostile cliques.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> He joined the staff of the <i><a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_Magazine_98b6.html" title="American Magazine">American Magazine</a></i> in 1911 with <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/n/Lincoln_Steffens_67c3.html" title="Lincoln Steffens">Lincoln Steffens</a>' invaluable help,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> and in 1912 published “Sangar”, probably his finest poem<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> (<a href="../../../../articles/p/o/e/Poetry_Magazine_bf22.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Poetry Magazine"><i>Poetry</i></a>, December 1912; also privately printed), besides producing the first of the Dutch Treat Club shows, "Everymagazine". The following year he issued privately <i>The Day in Bohemia</i>.</p>
<p>His central, tortuous, relationship in New York was with <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/b/Mabel_Dodge_Luhan_449a.html" title="Mabel Dodge Luhan">Mabel Dodge</a>, a married woman eight years his senior. They met in early spring 1913. She dominated, suffocated him; she threatened suicide several times when he seemed to neglect her.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Visiting <a href="../../../../articles/e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> later that year, they consummated their relationship in <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and friction clearly developed (he was very interested in the sights the continent had to offer; she was mainly preoccupied with him).<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Upon their return she continued to attempt to keep his mind off politics.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>His serious interest in social problems was first aroused, at about this time, by <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/n/Lincoln_Steffens_67c3.html" title="Lincoln Steffens">Lincoln Steffens</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/i/d/a/Ida_Tarbell_91bf.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Ida Tarbell">Ida Tarbell</a>, and once aroused it quickly led him to a far more radical position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Masses_745f.html" title="The Masses">The Masses</a></i>, edited by <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/x/Max_Eastman_ae8f.html" title="Max Eastman">Max Eastman</a>; he contributed over fifty articles, reviews and shorter pieces. The first of Reed’s many arrests came in <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/t/Paterson%2C_New_Jersey_6d06.html" title="Paterson, New Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of the <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/t/Paterson_Silk_Strike_of_1913_5fde.html" title="Paterson Silk Strike of 1913">strikers in the silk mills</a>. He spent four days in prison, helping to radicalize him and allying him with the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">IWW</a> (though he was still not a socialist);<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> his brilliant account of his experiences appeared in June as “War in Paterson”. During the same year, following a suggestion made by <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Haywood_5daa.html" title="Bill Haywood">Bill Haywood</a>, picked up by Dodge and enthusiastically endorsed by Reed, he put on “The Pageant of the Paterson Strike” in <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> for the benefit of the strikers. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1913 he was sent to <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> by the <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i> to report the <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/x/Mexican_Revolution_7e35.html" title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>; Dodge followed him to <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso</a> but returned several days later.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> He participated for four months in the perils of <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/n/Pancho_Villa_e0b8.html" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a>’s army, while his articles brought him national reputation as a war correspondent. They were republished in book form as <i>Insurgent Mexico</i> (1914). He was with Villa's Constitutionalist Army when it defeated Federal forces at <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/r/Torre%C3%B3n.html" title="Torreón">Torreón</a>, opening the way for its advance on <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> He adored Villa; <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/n/Venustiano_Carranza_c4ce.html" title="Venustiano Carranza">Carranza</a> left him cold; he deeply sympathized with the plight of the peons; and vehemently opposed American intervention, <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_occupation_of_Veracruz_2c94.html" title="United States occupation of Veracruz">which came</a> shortly after he left. On April 30, he arrived in <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, scene of the recent <a href="../../../../articles/l/u/d/Ludlow_massacre.html" title="Ludlow massacre">Ludlow massacre</a>; there he spent a little more than a week and investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, wrote an impassioned article on the subject (“The Colorado War”, published in July), and came to believe much more clearly in class conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> That summer he spent in <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Provincetown%2C_Massachusetts_81bc.html" title="Provincetown, Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a> with Dodge and her son, putting together <i>Insurgent Mexico</i> and interviewing <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_President_0c46.html" class="mw-redirect" title="United States President">President</a> <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Wilson</a> on the subject (the resulting report, much watered down at <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> insistence, was not a success).<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, shortly after <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">Germany</a> declared war on France and set <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> into full swing, he set sail for <a href="../../../../articles/i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, having been sent by the <i>Metropolitan</i>. He met Dodge in <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>; they made their way to Paris. They were uneasy with each other and she was depressed, knowing she could never fully possess him.

Going to <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Petrograd</a>, an outraged Reed found the ambassador inclined to believe they were spies, and they were re-arrested when they tried to slip into Romania; it was the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) who finally secured permission for them to leave, but not before all their papers were seized in <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>. It was at this time that his hatred for the Tsarist regime and love for the Russian people began to develop. In <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/c/Bucharest.html" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> they spent time piecing together their journey (Reed at one point traveling to <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, hoping to see action at <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, but being rebuffed), from which Reed’s <i>The War in Eastern Europe</i> (April 1916) would emerge.

Upon his arrival he was greatly excited by the fervor of revolution, and the American Ambassador placed him under close surveillance. Reed sensed that power was draining away from the <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/s/Russian_Provisional_Government_0715.html" title="Russian Provisional Government">Provisional Government</a> to the <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/v/Soviet_%28council%29.html" title="Soviet (council)">Soviets</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup> something which was confirmed by an October 10 visit to the <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvian</a> Front, where he observed the troops’ usual deference had been replaced by defiance to their officers.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup> However, unlike <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/o/Leon_Trotsky_11f4.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Trotsky</a> and other <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolsheviks</a>, who would later claim that their party had planned and guided events leading up to the <a href="../../../../articles/o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> (of which Reed and Bryant were enthusiastic observers), Reed saw a much more chaotic version of events that lacked inevitability.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup> He wrote much of the Bolshevik propaganda dropped over the German lines. He met Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/s/Russian_Constituent_Assembly_3f88.html" title="Russian Constituent Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> on January 18, 1918. By December, his initial <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>2000 grant (donated by a wealthy American radical<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup>) was nearly exhausted and, desperate for cash, he took employment with an American, Raymond Robins of the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement_9f28.html" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">Red Cross</a>, who wished to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied, but in the dummy issue he prepared he included a warning beneath the masthead: “this paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.”<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved, and two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/d/Red_Guards_%28Russia%29_1af0.html" title="Red Guards (Russia)">Red Guards</a> prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup> Reed then attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, where he hoped it would “call forth an answer from America’s oppressed and exploited masses.” American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup> In January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York; as the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, his credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). The appointment was viewed as a massive blunder by most Americans in Petrograd, and the businessman Alex Gumberg directly approached Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for the setting up of a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/e/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk_38d2.html" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk</a>.

His papers were not returned to him until November. Back in America, he took pains to defend the Bolsheviks and oppose American intervention, but a hyper-patriotic public incensed at Russia’s departure from the war gave him a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in <i>The Masses</i> and particularly a headline, “Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy”, had been largely instrumental in bringing an indictment against that magazine for <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/d/Sedition.html" title="Sedition">sedition</a>. The first <i>Masses</i> trial ended the day before he arrived in a hung jury; the defendants, including himself, were to be retried, so after returning, he immediately posted $2000 bail on April 29.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> The second trial also ended in a hung jury.

<p>Affiliated with the Left Wing of the <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_America_c2a9.html" title="Socialist Party of America">Socialist Party</a>, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919.

Reed’s writings from 1919 display doubts about Western-style democracy and defend the <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/c/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.html" title="Dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, which he saw as a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy “based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.”<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

John Reed's funeral in Moscow 1920</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What Reed did and thought on the way to the congress, while there, and returning is a matter of speculation, but years after abandoning Communism, his friend <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/n/Benjamin_Gitlow_263b.html" title="Benjamin Gitlow">Benjamin Gitlow</a> asserted that after the treatment he received from Zinoviev, Reed died in bitter disillusionment with the Communist movement.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> While in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant’s arrival in Moscow, where he impatiently came on September 15 and was able to tell her something of the preceding eight months, now looking older and wearing rags. He took her to meet Lenin, Trotsky, <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/v/Lev_Kamenev_ac99.html" title="Lev Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a>, and other leading Bolsheviks, and to visit Moscow’s ballet and art galleries.</p>

<p>Reed was determined to return home, but fell ill on September 25. At first diagnosed with <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a>, he was hospitalized five days later and was found to have spotted <a href="../../../../articles/t/y/p/Typhus.html" title="Typhus">typhus</a>. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained due to the Allied blockade. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup> After a hero’s funeral, his body was buried in the <a href="../../../../articles/k/r/e/Kremlin_Wall_Necropolis_82b6.html" title="Kremlin Wall Necropolis">Kremlin Wall Necropolis</a>.</p>

<p>Reed, allowed to occupy the roles of "romantic revolutionary" and "playboy" in American culture,<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup> was also used as a symbol by the Communist movement to which he belonged. He was the only American buried in the Kremlin, although half of <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Haywood_5daa.html" title="Bill Haywood">Bill Haywood</a>'s ashes are there as well. By the 1930s, John Reed Clubs, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in nearly all the large cities of the United States.</p>
<p>The 1981 film <i><a href="../../../../articles/r/e/d/Reds_%28film%29.html" title="Reds (film)">Reds</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/Warren_Beatty_c7a4.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/a/Diane_Keaton_f450.html" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jack_Nicholson_0c34.html" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> and based on his life, won three <a href="../../../../articles/a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, and was nominated for nine more. Other film portrayals of Reed include the 1982 two-part Soviet production <i>Red Bells</i>, starring <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Franco_Nero_f1f3.html" title="Franco Nero">Franco Nero</a>; and the 1973 film <i>Reed: Mexico Insurgente</i>, based on his accounts of the Mexican Revolution.</p>
<p>A perennial <a href="../../../../articles/u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> in Reed's hometown states that <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a> was named for him.
