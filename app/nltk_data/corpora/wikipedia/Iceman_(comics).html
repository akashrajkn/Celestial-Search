<p>Robert Drake was born in <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/r/Port_Washington%2C_New_York_7e24.html" title="Port Washington, New York">Port Washington</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass Drake. He is <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> on his mother's side and <a href="../../../../articles/i/r/i/Irish_Catholic_8b3c.html" title="Irish Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> on his father's.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> His powers first manifested when Bobby was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight; Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard about what Bobby did, came looking for him in the shape of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own "protection." While sitting in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a man named Scott Summers (<a href="../../../../articles/c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a>) walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After turning him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html" title="Professor X">Professor Charles Xavier</a> soon ended. After Xavier sat down and talked with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his "school for gifted youngsters." Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops, to become the second member of the <a href="../../../../articles/x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>. He is later joined by <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/a/Beast_%28comics%29.html" title="Beast (comics)">Hank McCoy</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/Warren_Worthington_III_5f93.html" title="Warren Worthington III">Warren Worthington III</a> as the charter members of the X-Men. Iceman quickly befriends Hank McCoy (<a href="../../../../articles/b/e/a/Beast_%28comics%29.html" title="Beast (comics)">Beast</a>), and the two serve as comic relief for the team. However, Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group.

<p>Upon rejoining the X-Men, Iceman becomes a member of the Gold Squadron, under the leadership of Storm. For much of his time, he continues his role as the team's practical joker and comic relief. However, when <a href="../../../../articles/e/m/m/Emma_Frost_f4bf.html" title="Emma Frost">Emma Frost</a>, the former White Queen of the <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Hellfire_Club_%28comics%29_72d0.html" title="Hellfire Club (comics)">Hellfire Club</a>, took over his body and used his powers at levels which he himself had previously been unable to reach, Iceman began to suffer from depression and begins to reassess his life. The White Queen subsequently believes that Iceman has the potential to be one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. At one point, Iceman confronts Emma demanding her to show him how she was able to use his powers in such a manner. Although she first tells him to "figure it out himself," she later goads him into accessing the power all by himself.</p>
<p>Around this time, Iceman takes a road-trip with fellow X-Man <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/g/Rogue_%28comics%29.html" title="Rogue (comics)">Rogue</a>. She becomes a danger to herself and others, forcing Iceman into the role of protector.

Their mission: save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. During their trips through time, Iceman was allowed to experience his abilities to far greater levels than he has ever attempted before. These experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer needs to fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returns to the X-Men intent on exploring his mutant powers to the fullest.</p>

<p>Iceman is able to lower his body temperature without causing harm to himself, reaching negative 105°F within a few tenths of a second. He is able to freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice to form ice-slides and various projectiles and shields (also ladders, baseball bats, etc.). He can travel rapidly along these ice-slides or ice-bridges by causing ice to form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, pushing him along the slick surface; he can increase his speed by emitting ice through his feet like a jet engine and can obtain speeds of modern jets. He is also able to summon moisture from the air and create a flood. Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures and has thermal vision: the ability to detect objects visually by how much heat the objects generate. According to the laws of thermodynamics, cold is defined as the absence of heat. Therefore, Iceman does not actually emanate cold, but rather absorbs and dispels heat. Since heat is a form of energy, Iceman's power can be defined as a psionic ability to manipulate thermal energy.</p>
<p>Over the years, his mutant <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/y/Physiology.html" title="Physiology">physiology</a> has gone through radical changes. First, he was able to fashion an <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">armor</a> of densely packed <a href="../../../../articles/s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">snow</a> around his human form when lowering his temperature; later, this became an armor of solid ice. Under the mind control of <a href="../../../../articles/e/m/m/Emma_Frost_f4bf.html" title="Emma Frost">Emma Frost</a>, his powers were used to a greater potential than he ever had, including being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes. He is also able to transform his body into pure organic ice (similar to the organic steel of <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/l/Colossus_%28comics%29.html" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a>). In normal human form, he has the strength, agility, and durability of a typical <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/athletic" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:athletic">athletic</a> male of his size. In his ice-form, his strength and durability were enhanced. When Frost gave up her mind control, Iceman was not able to duplicate what she had done with his own powers, although he now realized that he could push his powers to even greater heights.</p>
<p>At one point, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury and was stuck in his ice-form, afraid of what would happen if he changed back, and went to Emma Frost for help. She merely taunted him, unwilling to help, teasing him that his own self-esteem issues were the only thing holding him back from becoming one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. She hinted that his powers were rooted in the psionic manipulation of energy, and not in manipulation of moisture in the air as previously believed. She was finally able to push Iceman to the point where he lashed out, becoming somewhat malicious, causing her severe pain, and threatening to torture and kill her by slowly freezing the blood flow into her brain. He soon realized what she had been talking about, and he transformed back into his human form, healing the chest wound in the process. From that point forward, Iceman used his organic ice form instead of his ice armor. Sporadically, he would augment his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists.</p>
<p>Among his new-found abilities, Iceman is also able to reconstitute his ice-form if any part of it is damaged or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He is able to temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own to increase his mass, size, and physical power. His strength and durability in his ice-form are enhanced beyond normal human levels. He can survive not only as <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/n/Sentience.html" title="Sentience">sentient</a> ice, but as sentient water and <a href="../../../../articles/v/a/p/Vapor.html" title="Vapor">vapor</a>.

He has the capacity to manipulate all forms of moisture and possesses all of the abilities to generate <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Projectile.html" title="Projectile">projectiles</a>, slides, and <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/i/Shield.html" title="Shield">shields</a> that he had always possessed, but they have been augmented greatly.</p>

<p>Aside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Professor Xavier's School and coaching from <a href="../../../../articles/b/l/a/Black_Widow_%28Marvel_Comics%29_23c5.html" title="Black Widow (Marvel Comics)">Black Widow</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Hercules_%28Marvel_Comics%29_0bd5.html" title="Hercules (Marvel Comics)">Hercules</a>.

At the prompting of team leader <a href="../../../../articles/c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a>, Drake learns to cover his body with hardened-but-flexible ice and adopts the hard crystalline appearance familiar to modern readers<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup>. After being kidnapped by the Norse God Loki and used as a pawn against his half brother <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/o/Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29_b08e.html" title="Thor (Marvel Comics)">Thor</a>, Iceman's powers are augmented to uncontrollable levels, through a cryo-condenser. The process nearly kills him, however Loki is defeated, and Iceman is teleported back to his place of origin.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup>. With his powers greatly increased, Iceman temporarily loses control of his powers and is required to wear a bulky, metallic belt designed to keep his powers in control. Iceman later learns to control his augmented powers without the aid of his power dampening belt. Eventually, Iceman develops the ability to actually become organic ice, appearing almost translucent. He is virtually indestructible in this form, as he can reform his shattered body even if part of him is completely destroyed. For a time, Iceman became stuck in this ice form, due to a secondary mutation. However, after the events of <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/c/Decimation_%28comics%29.html" title="Decimation (comics)">M-Day</a>, Bobby feared losing his powers and reverts back to his human appearance. In an attempt on his life by the Leper Queen, believing him to be a mutant, Bobby is seconds away from death. Mentally alerting Scott and the others to come to Bobby's aid, Emma reaches out to Bobby through Cerebro to try and help him as quickly as she can. By reaching into his mind, Emma reactivates Bobby's powers through opening a series of mental blocks he has placed on himself, and saves him from near death. As a result of Emma "hacking" into Bobby's mind, Iceman donned a more grotesque transparent appearance, with organic bubbles, large veins, and spiky hair. Since this experience, Iceman has regained control over his powers and refined his appearance with jagged spikes on his limbs, back, and hair.</p>

Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls "moisture <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/l/Molecule.html" title="Molecule">molecular</a> inversion", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister. A couple of months later Iceman, Exodus, Wild Child, and Morph were sent on a secret mission by Magneto, only Wild Child's fate was revealed.</p>

<p>Ultimate Iceman never had the snowman look of his counter-part, instead generating a flexible ice armor from the beginning and still does so to this day. Bobby establishes himself as a valuable asset, single-handedly taking out the <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/t/Ultimates.html" title="Ultimates">Ultimates</a> once with a gigantic ice wall (<i>see <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/t/Ultimate_War_4e9f.html" title="Ultimate War">Ultimate War</a></i>), as well as single-handedly halting an invasion by Colonel <a href="../../../../articles/k/e/s/Kestrel_%28comics%29.html" title="Kestrel (comics)">Wraith</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a>. He was only able to be stopped by <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/g/Rogue_%28comics%29.html" title="Rogue (comics)">Rogue</a>, who was in temporary possession of <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Marvel Girl</a>'s telepathy. Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X-Men. During the <i>World Tour</i> arc, after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll, Bobby is greatly injured by <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Proteus_%28comics%29.html" title="Proteus (comics)">Proteus</a>, which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier. Bobby eventually rebels against his parents, and later returns to the X-Men.</p>
<p>Before Bobby joined the X-Men he had a girlfriend, but <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html#Ultimate_Charles_Xavier" title="Professor X">Professor Xavier</a> erased all memories of her from Bobby's mind when he told her too much about the X-Men (he presumably also erased the girl's memories). Upon her acceptance into the X-Men, Bobby begins to date <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/g/Rogue_%28comics%29.html#Ultimate_Rogue" title="Rogue (comics)">Rogue</a>. The pair date for a considerable amount of time, but eventually break up due to Bobby's growing feelings for <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/t/Kitty_Pryde_fe33.html#Ultimate_Shadowcat" title="Kitty Pryde">Shadowcat</a> and Rogue's feelings for <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/t/Alternate_versions_of_Gambit_7f75.html#Ultimate_Gambit" title="Alternate versions of Gambit">Gambit</a>. Eventually Rogue leaves, and Bobby starts to date Kitty until she dumps him after finding Bobby was still emailing Rogue. When Rogue returned to the X-Men, her original powers had been replaced with those of Gambit's. During the <i>Date Night</i> arc, Bobby and Rogue have sex with one another (the first time for both of them), due to her being able to touch him now. After this, the two rekindle their relationship, but recently problems have erupted due to the return of Rogue's old powers.</p>
<p>Though Ultimate Iceman is still somewhat clumsy at present, the Ultimate version of <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/m/Hammer_%28comics%29.html#Ultimate_Eisenhower_Canty" title="Hammer (comics)">Hammer</a>, who hailed from the future, exclaimed upon meeting and subsequently battling him: "Bobby Drake, huh? The Legend! I can't believe you're so inept at this point in your life! It's been an honour to kick your..." only for Wolverine to interrupt him. <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/s/Bishop_%28comics%29.html" title="Bishop (comics)">Bishop</a> also hinted to Bobby that he has a lot of potential, but Iceman shrugs off the acknowledgment.</p>
<p>In <i>Ultimate X-Men</i> #80, Bishop talks to Bobby about his potential and comments "With minimal effort you are taking moisture out of the air and slowing water molecules down to make them cold. What else can you slow down?" While this description is different in wording than that of his 616 counterpart, thermal energy is fundamentally the vibration speed of molecules. Faster vibrations equate to higher temperatures, so Bishop's explanation is essentially no different from the classic Iceman's mutant abilities. He also asks Bobby about exploring the possibilities with his powers, but Bobby merely shrugs him off and continues to play his video game.</p>
<p>Cyclops disbanded the X-Men in Ultimate X-Men #81 and Bishop and Storm created a new team. Iceman stayed at the Institute as a student only until Xavier returned and reformed his X-Men.</p>

During this battle, Iceman's ability to transform his body into ice is finally shown, giving him the form of Iceman from the comics, being first implied in a previous confrontation between the two former best friends in which Bobby's hand ices over. After the battle, he finds Rogue in her room, having taken the cure. The special version of X-Men 3: The Last Stand shows that Rogue did not in fact take the cure. Even so, Iceman chooses Rogue over Kitty Pryde.
