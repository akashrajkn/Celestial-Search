Harry Holland's memorial in <a href="../../../../articles/w/e/l/Wellington.html" title="Wellington">Wellington</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Holland was born near <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/e/Queanbeyan%2C_New_South_Wales_4dcb.html" title="Queanbeyan, New South Wales">Queanbeyan</a>, a town in <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> located quite close to modern <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>. Initially, he worked on his parents' farm, but later was apprenticed as a <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Compositor.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Compositor">compositor</a> for the <i>Queanbeyan Times</i>. Holland did not receive an extensive education, but developed an enthusiasm for reading. He also became highly religious, joining the <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>, Holland left Queanbeyan to work in <a href="../../../../articles/s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Shortly afterwards, on <a href="../../../../articles/o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">6 October</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, he married Annie McLachlan, who he had met at a Salvation Army meeting. The two were to have five sons and three daughters. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>, however, Holland found himself unemployed, putting the family in a poor financial position. Holland left the Salvation Army at this point, believing that its response to poverty was inadequate. He remained, however, quite strongly religious. Gradually, his political views became attuned to <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, although this was probably more an emotional decision than a theoretical one — Holland was deeply dedicated to the elimination of poverty, but had little use for complicated economic models.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Holland_4683.html" title="Edit section: Political activity in Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political activity in Australia</span></h2>
<p>Holland joined the small Australian Socialist League in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>. Later, he and a friend began to publish a socialist journal — in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, he was convicted of libelling the superintendent of the New South Wales Labour Bureau, and served three months in prison. Upon his release, the journal was moved to <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales_49e2.html" title="Newcastle, New South Wales">Newcastle</a> for a time, but eventually returned to Sydney.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, Holland stood as a candidate for the <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Australian Senate</a> and the state seat of Lang. He was standing for the Socialist Labor Party, having rejected the <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor Party</a> as too moderate. He did not make any significant impression. Later, in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, he stood in the New South Wales state elections, but was caught up in strong infighting between socialist groups. Holland had acquired a reputation of arrogance and egotism, and was convinced beyond all doubt that his views were correct.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, Holland was convicted of sedition, having advocated violent revolution against capitalism during the miners' strike at <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/o/Broken_Hill_5b6d.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a>. He was jailed for two years. He received little sympathy from the socialist movement, which considered his actions during the strike to be provokation and posturing. This embittered Holland considerably, and he suffered from serious depression.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, after his release from jail, Holland soon found himself in trouble with the law again. This time, it resulted from his refusal to register his son for compulsory <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Military_education_and_training.html" title="Military education and training">military training</a>. Rather than pay a fine, Holland left Australia and travelled to <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, accepting an invitation from the <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/i/Waihi.html" title="Waihi">Waihi</a> branch of the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_Socialist_Party_41a4.html" title="New Zealand Socialist Party">New Zealand Socialist Party</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Holland_4683.html" title="Edit section: Political activity in New Zealand">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political activity in New Zealand</span></h2>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Holland_4683.html" title="Edit section: Waihi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Waihi</span></h3>
<p>At the time of Holland's arrival, Waihi was descending into chaos. A <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/i/Waihi_miners%27_strike.html" title="Waihi miners' strike">bitter miners' strike</a>, the most significant industrial action that New Zealand had yet seen, was underway, and the conservative government of <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/William_Massey_8fda.html" title="William Massey">William Massey</a> was responding with strong measures. The strike eventually led to the death of a miner in a shoot-out with police. Holland was encouraged by the strike, believing that it was the beginning of "class war" against capitalism. This view was not shared, however, by the New Zealand Socialist Party, which, when the strike broke out, had actually asked Holland not to come to Waihi. The New Zealand socialists, for the most part, saw socialism as a means to an end, and distrusted Holland's view that socialism was a goal in and of itself. Many New Zealand socialists resented Holland's arrogance, seeing him as a self-opinionated outsider meddling in a precarious situation that he did not fully understand.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Holland_4683.html" title="Edit section: Moderation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Moderation</span></h3>
<p>Gradually, however, Holland's militancy decreased. His co-authorship of a tract on the Waihi strike gained him a certain amount of prestige, as did his editorship of the Federation of Labour's newspaper. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, a candidate of the <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_cb4c.html" title="Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)">Social Democratic Party</a> (which the Socialist Party had merged into) was elected to Parliament with backing from the mainstream <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_1c8b.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a>, and Holland was happy — at one stage, he would have condemned co-operation with any non-socialist organisation. Holland himself, however, still ran into difficulties with the law. In the 1913 waterfront dispute, he was charged with sedition, and served time in jail. This time, however, he was widely seen as a martyr, and gained considerable support.</p>
<p><a name="Labour_Party" id="Labour_Party"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Holland_4683.html" title="Edit section: Labour Party">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Labour Party</span></h3>
<p>With the gradual unification of the labour movement in New Zealand, the (second) <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour Party</a> was founded in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. Holland was one of the founding members, although his opinions about the direction of the party were not identical to some of the party's other leaders. Holland believed that the Labour Party would lay the foundations for socialism, while the more moderate members of the party simply wanted to improve the wages and conditions of workers.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/d/Paddy_Webb_f7dd.html" title="Paddy Webb">Paddy Webb</a>, a Labour MP, was jailed for refusing military service. Holland stood in the resulting by-election to replace him, and was narrowly elected. Holland was delighted with his victory, but other members of the party were less enthusiastic — Holland's majority was far lower than Webb's had been. Holland dismissed this, saying that his victory, unlike Webb's, had been for pure socialism rather than mere reform. Holland represented the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Grey.html" title="Grey">Grey</a> electorate 1918-19, and then the <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/l/Buller.html" title="Buller">Buller</a> electorate from 1919 until he died.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1919_8db0.html" class="mw-redirect" title="New Zealand general election 1919">1919 elections</a>, the first contested by the Labour party as a united bloc, Holland narrowly defeated the moderate <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_McCombs_9e0a.html" title="James McCombs">James McCombs</a> for the parliamentary leadership of the party, becoming Labour's first leader in the modern sense. Most historians see his victory as being due to his public profile rather than to his policies, which many in the Labour Party considered too extreme. In Parliament, Holland was not a particularly strong performer. His aggressive oratory, while suitable for speeches, tended to oversimplify issues, and Holland was frequently criticised in Parliamentary debates as an impractical idealogue. Holland's opponents successfully characterised him as applying simplistic doctrines to complicated issues, and of failing to look at a problem from all sides.</p>
<p>As the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> took hold, however, Holland began to doubt some of his convictions. At first, Holland had believed that the Depression marked the beginning of the end for capitalism, but as the economic problems continued, and many workers were cast into poverty, Holland began to question whether his theories were capable of solving the crisis. Suffering from depression, exhaustion, and ill health, Holland began to withdraw from the activities of leadership. Talk of a possible challenge to his leadership appeared, but there was not yet any willingness for an open confrontation.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, Holland unexpectedly died of a <a href="../../../../articles/m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>, attending the funeral of <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/_/Te_Rata_Mahuta_e343.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Te Rata Mahuta">Te Rata Mahuta</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/n/Huntly%2C_New_Zealand_0667.html" title="Huntly, New Zealand">Huntly</a>.
