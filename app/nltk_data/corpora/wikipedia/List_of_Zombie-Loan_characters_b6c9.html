<dd>Michiru possesses <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/i/Shinigami.html" title="Shinigami">Shinigami</a> Eyes, which allows her to see a ring on a person's neck, indicating their impending death. However, she has hated her gift ever since she saw dark rings around her parents' necks, who died in an accident after the rings turned jet black. She now wears glasses that can subdue her gift, allowing her to live her life normally. Although, since the death of her parents, she has felt a numb complacency with life, living it out, but having no will to achieve anything or even care if she dies or not, an attitude which disgusts Shito.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Michiru first meets Chika and Shito in the hallways of her school, accidentally tripping over Chika's hand. After she ends up finding out their secret, they initially think of killing her, but when they find out that she has Shinigami Eyes, they instead inform her that she will be using her powers to help them fight <a href="../../../../articles/z/o/m/Zombies.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Zombies">zombies</a>, despite her protests. After various failures and meeting other members of the Z-Loan office, Michiru comes to accept her new job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>She often takes the brunt of Chika's abuse and is initially called '500-<a href="../../../../articles/j/a/p/Japanese_yen.html" title="Japanese yen">yen</a>' by him, due to the fact that he believes she owes him <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/p/Japanese_yen.html" title="Japanese yen">¥</a>500. He later begins to call her a "gopher" since she often does what other people ask of her without question. <sup id="cite_ref-character_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-character-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Also, the members of the Z-Loan office also use her to awaken Koyomi Yoimachi's other personality, Yomi, who seems to have grown a liking for Michiru. However, Michiru is often reluctant in doing so, as Yomi tends to fondle her.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Birthday: March 23</li>
<li>Height: 175.5 cm</li>
<li>Weight: 66kg</li>
<li>Blood type: B</li>
<li>Nickname: "Boy B" or "B" ("<i>B-<a href="../../../../articles/j/a/p/Japanese_titles.html#San" class="mw-redirect" title="Japanese titles">san</a></i>")</li>
<li>Status: Zombie</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Chika is referred to as "Boy B" or simply "B" ("<i>B-san</i>"), titles which greatly irritate him, after surviving an accident with Shito, known as "Boy-A", six months prior to the start of the series. His attitude is rather lively and extroverted, but he is also short-tempered; he is often seen beating Michiru for her various failures. He appears to be fonder of Shito than Shito is of him, being occasionally concerned for his welfare, though he goes into a sulk and rejects Shito completely if they argue. His room in the special dormitory is entirely empty, possibly because unlike Shito, he does not expect to be there for very long.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Chika is linked with Shito by a spiritual chain, which cannot be seen by normal people. This chain allows them to switch their right hands with each other; due to the terms of their contract, their real right hands, which they both lost in the accident, were switched when they were revived by the Zombie-Loan. With Shito's right hand, which is actually Chika's original right hand, Chika has the ability to generate a <a href="../../../../articles/k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">katana</a> possessing <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/i/Shinigami.html" title="Shinigami">Shinigami</a> abilities.<sup id="cite_ref-character_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-character-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> With the katana, Chika is able to guide the souls of those zombies they defeat to <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>. Though often seen with a short temper, Chika has a genuine care for those he defeats and often performs their memorial with great sympathy. Though they have free will and emotions, both Chika and Shito are still considered zombies, so his ultimate goal is to regain his life once again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Surprisingly, Chika has a very cheery family, though he does not live with them since he lives in the special dorms with the others. His father turns out to be a doting cross-dresser who annoys Chika constantly by fussing over him, and is also in disguise as the Ferryman. His sister tends to pay more attention to her cellphone and is basically indifferent to what is going on around her, though Chika adores her and wants her affection. However, he is worried that when he gets home, he will be treated like an outcast due to the circumstances surrounding his hand; he is worried that it will rot off all of a sudden and his family will detest and fear him.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Birthday: January 21</li>
<li>Height: 176 cm</li>
<li>Weight: 64kg</li>
<li>Blood type: AB</li>
<li>Nickname: "Boy A" or "A" ("<i>A-san</i>")</li>
<li>Status: Zombie</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shito's name means either 'apostle' or 'purpose for which money is spent', and is referred to as "Boy A" or simply "A" ("<i>A-san</i>") by most students in his school. Due to his looks and attitude, he is seen as an idol by the female students, though he seems not care. He is generally a much more approachable person than Chika, but certain situations and people cause him to act cold and indifferent; when Michiru first told him that she had no real will to live, he told her how disgusted that made him feel, going on to say that he believes she does not deserve the right to live.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His room in the dorm is filled with colorful junk and collectibles, and he can apparently tell if any of these are moved so little as two millimeters. His most precious item is a decorative comb with descriptive flowers called <a href="../../../../articles/l/y/c/Lycoris.html" title="Lycoris">lycoris</a> engraved onto it, which his mother gave him in his early years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not much is known about Shito, and his personal history is also shrouded in mystery. However, what is known is that holds a very high status as a tool of the notorious Xu Fu Mafia. He is acquainted with Toho, a Mafia member, who views him as a "perfect monster", yet also "disgustingly beautiful" and as an important asset.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Shito dislikes Toho due to the torture that he gives Shito himself. Also, it is later revealed that Shito did not die on the same day as Chika, but was already a zombie before the accident, and had been placed at the school under the disguise of a normal sixteen-year-old human by the Zombie Loan office. Shito's mother was also a zombie, and through the Corpse Release Spell, Shito was actually born a zombie out of a 7 year pregnancy.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This is why he does not have any sympathy for those who have life yet do not want it.</dd>
<dd>His exact age is also unknown, but he met Bekkō in <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> (his native land) at the end of the nineteenth century looking just as he does now, making him at least a hundred years old. Toho has also observed that he has been handed down for generations. No matter how many wounds Shito receives, he is able to live on until the end of the world or so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shito is linked with Chika by a spiritual chain. When he attaches Chika's right hand, or rather his own original right hand, he can generate a 9½ inch <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a>, which has the power to harm zombies with its spiritual bullets using his own ectoplasm.<sup id="cite_ref-character_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-character-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In contrast to Chika's ability to guide souls to Heaven, Shito is able to guide souls to <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>. It is not known what Shito wants to gain through the contract with the Zombie Loan office; while Chika wants to regain his life, Shito was never alive. Though they are always together, Chika and Shito are far from friends; they are only close together because if they are apart, their right hands will begin to rot due to being taken too far from their original owners. However, Shito does try to save Chika rather than just letting him die on several occasions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the end of the anime, Chika is able to have Shito break out of his shell and call him by his first name by refusing to let Shito save him otherwise, and without thinking call Michiru by her first name as well. Shito also shows his more humane side when he grows to care for a golem, realizing that they are not just walking corpses but beings with lives. Sadly, she is then shot in the head, and he is quite upset about that. Through the later episodes, it seems that this golem was very much like Shito's mother.</dd>

<dd>Bekkō is the manager of the Z-Loan office and a Ferryman (Watashimori); he is the one who gives people their loans. Although he appears to be greedy, Bekkō is not stingy when it comes to giving proper burials for the zombies they have come in contact with or giving money to the zombies' families. He is shown to be quite good at ping pong defeating Shito in episode 7 without letting Shito even taking a point off him. Since he is at least old enough to have met Shito in Shanghai at the end of the nineteenth century, he is probably not human, though as Michiru has not noticed a black ring on his neck he cannot be a zombie either.<br clear="all" /></dd>

<dd>An illegal zombie, known as the "Butterfly", and an old acquaintance of Chika's. Shiba appears to be a calm, cool, agreeable, highly intellectual person, and never seems to ask too many questions. Despite this, Shiba gains the great dislike of Shito due to his suspicious vast amount of knowledge on the Butterfly case. He and Chika get along fairly well since they were best friends in middle school. He is easily bored, but with Chika in his life, things were never dull until they parted ways when they entered high school. It is revealed that he killed himself by jumping off the roof, simply because he was bored of the monotonous life he had. He is the first zombie in the series to be reaped by the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">grim reaper</a> instead of a member of the Zombie Loan.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> He initially fought by projecting and controlling an ectoplasmic knife, but by volume 8, he is shown to be using a <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/y/Scythe.html" title="Scythe">scythe</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>An entity of unknown origin or nature that reaps souls. His entire body, except for his left eye, is covered in bandages. It is formed by the materialization of astral around a powerful energy source known as the 'core', which is later stolen by a human he was trying to reap. Not having a body, he is forced to reside in a <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_deformed.html" title="Super deformed">super deformed</a> state that Michiru thinks is adorable. He is known by his associate Koume as Zarame-sama, which translates into English as 'Mr Sugar Candy', and has the ability to generate a <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/y/Scythe.html" title="Scythe">scythe</a> at will.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He can only speak in muffled, high-pitched, squeaky noises, due to the bandages across his mouth and his super deformed state, but both Michiru and Koume hear him as speaking normally, though most of what he says are threats or insults. At the end of the anime, he still does not have his 'core' back, but seems content to perch on Michiru's shoulder.</dd>
