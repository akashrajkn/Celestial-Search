<p>This song was performed live throughout the 2006 US tour.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>After watching Mel Gibson's harrowing 2004 film The Passion of the Christ I immediately wrote three songs. This was one of them. It is not so much a rail against the principles of justice through the ages, but a challenge to the vanity of the men who need to put on some kind of ridiculous outfit in order to pass sentence on one of their peers. It is the idea that men need dress up in order to represent God that appalls me. If I wanted to be as insane as to attempt to represent God I’d just go ahead and do it, I wouldn't dress up like a drag-queen.</p>

<li><b>"Mike Post Theme"</b></li>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Who songs have been used recently for TV shows. I thought a lot about why there are people who feel that isn’t a cool thing to do. <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/k/Mike_Post_f38c.html" title="Mike Post">Mike Post</a> is a man who has written a number of TV themes that I feel have created a kind of regular sparkle in my life – they have reminded me that life comes one day at a time, and that it is truly the little things in life (like Soap Operas on TV) that help ease the big troubles. The larger theme in the background of this song is the statement that we are no longer strong enough or young enough to love. In a very real way, movies, novels and TV series do help us to express selfless emotions as we once did when we were in love. Men cry quietly watching TV and movies, women maybe a little more openly, but when we do that we are reconnecting with our innocent and free-flowing feelings. If only we could still do that with the principle lover in our lives.</p>

<p>In addition to the mini-opera, "Mike Post Theme" was debuted live at their Leeds University gig on <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a> <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. When announcing the song, Roger said that it hadn't been recorded yet, leading fans to believe that it wouldn't appear on the album despite being a favourite among those who had heard it. It appears that a version was recorded during a brief break in the tour.</p>

<p>In my Novella The Boy Who Heard Music the narrator is Ray High, a rock star whose drug-abuse has led him to a sanatorium. While there he learns to meditate and begins to sense that someone is interfering with his quietude up in the place where he allows his mind to go. It seems almost as though they are using a Ham Radio, and old fashioned long-wave radio that was the specialist precursor to the modern internet Chat-Room. He may sense another presence, but this song reinforces how lonely it is to be .spiritual.. If the intention of the spiritual aspirant is to 'become one with the infinite', and yet life is almost the universally finite antidote to the infinite, isn't he likely to get very lonely?</p>

The song was later released as a download on Pete's website, but fans were put off by Pete's strange vocals, reminiscent of Tom Waits, and Roger reportedly passed over singing the song for the album.</p>

<p>The first song from Wire &amp; Glass, a 'Mini-Opera', ten songs that comprise the principal music composed so far for the novella The Boy Who Heard Music. A young man (the young Ray High) is driving a large camper bus with extreme air-con around an Estuary close to a large Power Station. He can see that the sea is swarming with a plague of jellyfish encouraged by the over-heated sea water (this is based on something that happened around 1971 in the Blackwater Estuary in Essex). He stops and looks at the water, throws a stick for his dog, who he has to rescue. In the sky he sees the future – nothing ecological or apocalyptic, more a vision of a society strangled by wire and communications.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Reportedly, this track, the following track ("Pick Up the Peace"), and an unreleased track titled "Ambition" (see below) were written in 1971. The character of Ray High also appeared as the protagonist of Townshend's solo album <a href="../../../../articles/p/s/y/Psychoderelict.html" title="Psychoderelict">Psychoderelict</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Ray High, now an old '60s rocker, is meditating in what looks like a cell in a secure hospital. He sees three teenagers from his neighbourhood getting together as kids do, playing, flirting, talking, and forming a band. Then he has an intuition that they are going to become stars. They are Gabriel, Josh and Leila. (They call their band The Glass Household). In striking contrast he sees scenes from his own childhood in the same neighbourhood, bombed buildings and old soldiers.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>The three kids are from very different families. Gabriel is from a show biz family of lapsed Christians. Josh is from a fairly devout Jewish family (they observe Sabbath) who have suffered a tragedy, the loss of their father in an incident in Israel. Leila, from a Muslim family who have also suffered a loss: that of her beautiful and charismatic mother who died when she was very young. They each share fantasies, and afflictions, gifts and ideas, and become deeply committed friends. Like urchin-angels they share their secrets: Gabriel hears music; Josh voices; Leila can fly.</p>
</div>

<p>To date, this was only performed on three occasions throughout the US 2006 tour (Philadelphia, Wantagh, and Calgary).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"Trilby's Piano"</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Josh's widowed mother vests all her hopes in her brother Hymie becoming a great man. He falls in love with Trilby, Gabriel's goofy blonde Aunt. Trilby is the one who has nurtured Gabriel's great musical talent, unnoticed by his preoccupied mother. The kids decide to put on a musical play at Leila's father's studio featuring this song, and it finally breaks Josh's mother's resistance to the love match. The song is sung by Gabriel. The play is a naiive children's effort, but with a grand proscenium stage (like a large Victorian puppet theatre) a stairway and a cherub and angel filled backdrop.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>At some point in their rehearsals for the play, the three teenagers unearth documents that turn out to have belonged to Ray High, Leila's father’s old studio partner. The documents refer to a crazy scheme to use the global wire network Ray saw as a young man to spread unifying music to everyone. (This matches my own vision for the Lifehouse Method, a computer-driven website through which people can commission their unique musical portrait.) They pore over the plans and realize that his scheme might be something they can make happen.</p>

<p>Pete performed this song solo at Joe's Pub on <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.

On both occasions, when not performed with the mini-opera, the full version with a reprise of the first verse and an additional chorus was played; Pete has said this variation is one of two bonus tracks that will feature on special editions of the album.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><b>"They Made My Dream Come True*"</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Still in his cell, Ray High can observe the kids' rise to fame while meditating. He foresees a tragedy, someone at the band’s biggest ever, and last, concert will die. He rues the fact that the rock industry seems unable to change. What is never clear is whether the concert he foresees ever takes place in reality, or actually remains a dream forever.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>"Mirror Door*"</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>The three pursue their own dream: to perform an extraordinary elaboration of their children's play in Central Park in New York that is webcast to the entire world for charity, and during which they demonstrate Ray's idea to 'turn everyone into music'. Where there was once a small puppet theatre stage, there is now a massive one; where there was once a small stairway to the back of the stage, there is now a stairway hoisted by blimps that seems to reach into the heavens. The band play, it becomes clear that there are terrorists on the streets trying to distract from the celebration, but the show goes on. At the top of the stairway appear gathered a series of legendary singers from popular music, all dead. A shot rings out and the tragedy is established. Josh, a paranoid schizophrenic, has stopped taking his medication and grabbed a pistol from someone and shot Gabriel. We cannot help our own. He ascends the stairway to join the dead. Even now, it is not clear whether this particular series of events actually takes place.</p>
<p>It will be noted that one of the listed names of deceased singing geniuses (Doris Day) is still alive. In show-biz heaven, behind the ‘Mirror Door’ no one ever really dies (it is rather like an after-show pub gathering). FRAGMENTS, the kid's biggest hit, becomes a moment to look back and celebrate life, death, breath, creation, science, physics, maths, literature and growth.</p>

<p>This song was released to the radio stations ahead of the mini-opera in June 2006, but was remixed for the <i><a href="../../../../articles/w/i/r/Wire_%26_Glass_fbc5.html" title="Wire &amp; Glass">Wire &amp; Glass</a></i> release later in July.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"Tea &amp; Theatre"</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Years later Josh and Leila – now old - take tea together. Coincidentally Josh's protective sanatorium cell is next to Ray's and they have just – together – revived once again the children’s play, this time with the inmates of the sanatorium. They reflect on their career and lives together. The inference here is that perhaps, just maybe, Ray (the narrator) has confused the play he just saw in the Sanatorium with the one they all hoped to see happen one day in New York, in the sky, and up into the universe.</p>

<p>Fans have interpreted this song as being about the death of John Entwistle and Pete's and Roger's decision to carry on as The Who, though Pete refuted this in interviews, saying that it was the concluding track of <i>The Glass Household</i>, but that he was pleased that people interpreted it differently. "Tea &amp; Theatre" was the final performance of The Who's concerts throughout the US 2006 tour, with just Pete (on acoustic guitar) and Roger at the front of the stage; the studio version utilizes a drum machine and bass guitar.</p>

<p>In addition to the nineteen tracks listed above, three songs were either considered for inclusion on the album or reportedly recorded for the album but were left off:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"Ambition"</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Reportedly written in 1971 for the <i>Lifehouse</i> concept, Pete debuted this song on <i>In the Attic</i> in 2006.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"Uncertain Girl"</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Another song that was debuted by Townshend on <i>In the Attic</i> in 2006. It was recorded in the studio with Zak on drums, and Roger on vocals, but Pete expressed doubt on whether it would make it on the album or not when he first played it on In The Attic, and it wasn't included. However, it did make an appearance in the <a href="../../../../articles/v/a/s/Vassar_College_ee90.html" title="Vassar College">Vassar College</a> workshop performance of the rock musical <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Boy_Who_Heard_Music_da24.html" title="The Boy Who Heard Music">The Boy Who Heard Music</a></i>.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Here is a film I made of a working day developing a demo of a song for the next Who album called "How Can I Help You, Sir?" I have played this in raw form on Rachel Fuller's IN THE ATTIC and last night on her Pay For View Christmas Special. That is the way it sounds played acoustic. What you can hear here is the way it is beginning to evolve as a rock track. Adding Roger's voice will increase the edge.</p>
<p>In a very real sense every song I write when I sit at home with an acoustic guitar has two distinct lives. The acoustic version may seem to be softer and more intimate. But in this case - in a song about a sick person's refusal to allow anyone to help them, a lonely person refusing to allow anyone to get close - the acoustic version has more bite. The rock version seems altogether more jolly, almost a throwaway. It will be interesting to see how it sounds when Roger and I get it into the studio together.</p>

<p>The song was not included on the album, but fans were approving of the track anyway. The video can be found here <a href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/media/strangeweatherbb.mov" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/media/strangeweatherbb.mov" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>A Roger Daltrey-penned song, rehearsed with <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Entwistle_c8ff.html" title="John Entwistle">John Entwistle</a> on bass, was rumoured to be recorded for the album. It was also supposed to include a bass line from Entwistle that had been recorded at a soundcheck or a rehearsal, though this has not yet surfaced.</p>
<p>At least three other songs were demoed, rehearsed, or recorded for the album. According to a <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/j/Mojo.html" title="Mojo">Mojo</a> article by Dave Marsh, the titles were "Cinderella" (about a friend of Townshend's who was abused as a child), "He Said, She Said" (about a relationship told through the views of both the man and woman), and "There's No Doubt" (based on something said to Townshend by The Who's manager <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Curbishley_908a.html" title="Bill Curbishley">Bill Curbishley</a> when asked if his new wife was "the one").</p>
<p>Poems were posted on Pete's site throughout the spring of 2006 leading up to his 61st birthday, which fans thought could turn into song lyrics; indeed, Pete had posted an entry which gave lyrics to a song titled "You're Useless, but You're Mine" (about Townshend's dog) which were later removed. Fans thought Pete removed the lyrics because it was going to be recorded as a Who song but it's likely the song wasn't recorded; no explanation for the removal was ever given.</p>
