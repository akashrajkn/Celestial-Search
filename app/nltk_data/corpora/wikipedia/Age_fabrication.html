	    <p><b>Age fabrication</b> occurs when an individual deliberately misrepresents his or her true age. It is usually practised with the intent to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to the individual. This can be accomplished by making oral or written statements, by using falsified documents, or by altering archives of <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/t/Vital_records.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Vital records">vital records</a>.</p>
<p>For example, until the early 1950s in <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/l/Hollywood.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> it was extremely common for <a href="../../../../articles/a/c/t/Actresses.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Actresses">actresses</a> to subtract at least one year from their actual age. On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cutoffs for minimum legal or employable age in <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/o/Showbusiness.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Showbusiness">showbusiness</a> or <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Professional_sports.html" title="Professional sports">professional sports</a>. There are many stories of men lying about their age to join the armed forces, for example to fight in <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> <a href="http://www.1914-1918.net/recruitment.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1914-1918.net/recruitment.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as <a href="../../../../articles/p/u/b/Publicist.html" title="Publicist">publicists</a>, parents, and other handlers. Using original source material such as <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/r/Birth_certificate.html" title="Birth certificate">birth certificates</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marriage_license.html" title="Marriage license">marriage licenses</a>, the <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> applications, <a href="../../../../articles/i/d/e/Identity_document.html" title="Identity document">identity documents</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/a/Death_certificate.html" title="Death certificate">death certificates</a> usually provides the correct date and year. Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme case such as with <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/_/Al_Lewis_%28actor%29_a6ae.html" title="Al Lewis (actor)">Al Lewis</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charo.html" title="Charo">Charo</a>, a decade has been added or subtracted.</p>

<li>There have been many alleged cases among cricketers, especially those from Pakistan. The practice reflects a lack of formal birth records in parts of Pakistan, and also young cricketers' (and their associates') desire to make a big impact in age group cricket by playing when overage.

However, unlike with the American examples above it may be that the claimed ages cannot be disproved with certainty because authoritative documentation is not merely concealed but actually nonexistent.</li>
