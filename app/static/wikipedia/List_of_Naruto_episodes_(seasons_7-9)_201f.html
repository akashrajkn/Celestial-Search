Toki assumes the identity of the Noroimusha, and attempts to attack Mousou, but is subdued by Mousou's imitation ninjutsu. Mousou's Watari ninjas and Naruto's group join the battle. While his companions fight the Watari ninja, Naruto pursues Mousou and is caught in a genjutsu. Mousou reveals to be Oki the migrating ninja, who plans to travel and collect as many jutsus as possible. He seemingly kills Shima and knocks Naruto underwater.

Shino, Naruto and Ino decided to continue their original mission: To protect the official payments and capture the Kaima (Isaribi).</p>
<p>The group heads to Kikaijima, an island located in the Land of the Sea where supposedly the Kaima resides. Anko awakes and explains that the Kaima is a human who has undergone physical transmutations. While they are talking, Yoroi and Isaribi head underwater to Orochimaru's lair. Inside, Isaribi passes on the information relating to the official payments and asks when she will return to normal. Yoroi tells her that she is a prototype and when he is done collecting information from her, he would change her back. He also sends her to dispatch Naruto and the rest of the group who has just arrived on the shore.</p>
