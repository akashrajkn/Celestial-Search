<p>Mars Hill is an educational approach that has grown out of a specific Christian Community. In 1974, a small group of men began a Bible study which became Lexington Christian Fellowship. At the heart of that study were some basic values which governed the development of the church and continue to give direction to the community.</p>
<p>In one sense, you could say that Mars Hill began in 1974. As the families of LCF grew, the values of the Kingdom pressed us to give diligence to family and child training. Not only were we called by God's desire to give attention to these areas, but, we were desirous to live this area for His glory.</p>
<p>For many of us, protecting our children from relativism, pluralism and humanism lead us to homeschooling. By the time our children began to reach Jr. High, we realized that we could pull the community together and share our abilities in teaching our children.</p>
<p>We realized that we had a great resource of men and women who embraced the cross, lived for God's glory and were willing to pour their lives out for others. As soon as the need was known, God began to put it together.</p>
<p>During this time, Martin Cothran had been sensing a greater call to teach students. In a discussion, he and Billy Henderson, the pastor of Lexington Christian Fellowship found that what was going on in both of their hearts was heading in the same direction. With surprisingly little work, the first year of Mars Hill came together in 1993-94. Most of the students were from Lexington Christian Fellowship.</p>
<p>In the next few years, Mars Hill developed into a full offering of classes for grades 7-12. At each step, the basic values of LCF were used to direct the development of the program. While the developers were faithful to God's values, He was faithful to His children.</p>
<p>Now, all of the classes are taught by qualified men and women of God. The students excel academically. The atmosphere of the school reflects God's kingdom. Community the key to success</p>
<p>We believe the overwhelming success of Mars Hill is due to it being the expression of a clear community based in common values. A key issue in child training is consistency. If the home does not reinforce what is taught at church, the result is confusion. If the spirit of the school is different than the church and home, it can also bring confusion.</p>
<p>The largest group of students in Mars Hill are from Lexington Christian Fellowship. They have all been raised following child training principles based in our core values. Students from outside LCF are accepted through interviews which try to determine if the family holds a view similar to the heart of LCF.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion or division, it is clearly stated that Mars Hill is an extension of the LCF community. As such, it is overseen by the leadership of LCF. That oversight is to assure that principles of brokenness, servanthood, knowing God, etc. remain central to the education of our children.</p>
<p>As a result, those who are not a part of LCF who find us and become a part of Mars Hill carry, at least in spirit, the same values and are seeking a community for their children. In the process, LCF has profited much through these other families who have grown in the same values. They have brought with them a presence of Christ and desire to serve.</p>
<p><a name="Values" id="Values"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Mars_Hill_Academy%2C_Lexington_c346.html" title="Edit section: Values">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Values</span></h3>
<p>By reading through the following values, a person can begin to determine if Mars Hill carries the same values as your own local church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing God</li>
</ul>
<p>All LCF values center in an overarching desire to Know God. Every person who has been added to the church since the beginning has been accepted based on the fact that their chief aim was, along with Paul, "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus." Philippians 3:10-12</p>
<p>We believe that this chief aim includes the Westminster response, To Glorify God...</p>
<p>If God has truly gripped a person with this desire, we believe it is the first step toward being insulated from moral relativism and humanism. On the other hand, if a person does not hold this chief value, he will constantly question the community in terms of why and how they do things. In reality, they become a spokesman for secular humanism within the community, even though they may consider themselves evangelical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loving one another</li>
</ul>
<p>Having God's Glory and Knowing Him as primary leads to a whole host of supporting values. The first of which is what is known as the Royal Law: "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:" James 2:8 This value is mysteriously inseparable from the first value of knowing God. "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" 1 John 4:20 So, then, we cannot say that we love God if we are not loving our brother.</p>
<p>Again, this value militates against secular culture. We have determined that the intent of this scripture is not, as some Christian counselors would have one believe, that you love yourself first and then you can love others. It means more clearly, that where in the past we would have put ourselves first, we now put others first.</p>
<p>Of course, any community that would attempt to live this sort of life will face an onslaught of opposition from within and without. At every corner, members must face deep rooted self interest. Once I commit myself to loving others first, the battle against my old way explodes. Self interest is not only the nature of unregenerate man, it is the philosophy that has governed every habit and pattern of life. One truly goes into culture shock upon entering a Christian community.</p>
<p>It becomes the chore of the community to unravel all of the methods and devices developed by their native culture (to the degree that those methods and devices oppose the new kingdom). The end result is a restructuring of almost every relationship. It changes the view of marriage, family, work relationships, church government, and peers to name a few.</p>
<p>These two overarching values could really be stated in the common scripture, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these." Mark 12:30-31</p>
<p>To embrace these values creates a whole new paradigm in which a culture develops. Subsequent values emerge that become governing values of the community.</p>
<p>Here are some of the values which developed in the history of Lexington Christian Fellowship that have influence on how Mars Hill operates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity</li>
</ul>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 "That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians begins by describing God's original intent and final goal as it relates to mankind. That final goal, as described in the verse mentioned, is to pull all things together in Christ. Chapter four begins by commanding that we, "With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." The writer continues by saying that we should reflect God's original intent and ultimate end by yielding to the power working in us to walk is right relationship to: 1)The church (Eph 4:11-32) 2)Our spouse (5:21-33) 3)Parents and children (6:1-4)Employers and employees (6:5-9) and, ultimately 5)The rest of the world by desiring that they too would submit to this Kingdom (6:18-20).</p>
<p>To place this type of unity at the center of your life is very costly and causes the believer to rethink his interactions on every level.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Church</li>
</ul>
<p>Ephesians 3:20-21 "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."</p>
<p>Of course this new culture must be governed in some way. The questions of who and how are answered in the same book of Ephesians. This is all to happen in the church. A brief study of the New Testament reveals a basic principle: The people of God are to grow in grace and knowledge. Those who have yielded their lives over many years to the ministry of the Word and the work of the Spirit are more conformed to His image. As a result, they are better equipped to help younger believers wade through the issues of living after Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, the direction of the church is not determined by the vote of immature Christians, but by the wise direction of older men who have laid down their lives for the flock and Jesus. In addition, being a member of the body dictates commitments and responsibilities to one another, while assuring benefits from one another. However, these are only realized when we allow ourselves to be "placed" by God (Cor. 12:18) and equipped by ministers (Ephesians 4:12).</p>
<p>This kingdom idea of being placed and trained especially confronts modern ideas of church life.</p>
<p>So, Lexington Christian Fellowship values the church. Members value being placed by God rather than choosing a church. We yield ourselves to be trained in serving one another rather than looking for ministers who will meet our needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cross (Brokenness)</li>
</ul>
<p>Matthew 16:24-26 "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</p>
<p>Here, Jesus is telling Peter that the only way that He can secure the Kingdom, is by going to the cross.</p>
<p>The application of this principle for believers, is illuminated by the story of the rich man in Mark 6. Here, the rich young man was sorrowful and walked away from the rule of Christ in his life because he could not give up his riches. Jesus goes on to declare the near impossibility of a rich man to enter the Kingdom. However, he consoles the disciples with the rich man"s only hope, "And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible." Mark 6:27</p>
<p>This brings the discussion back to Philippians 3 where Paul desires, "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;"</p>
<p>First, the true believer desires to die to the old man. Secondly, the believer must rely on God to help him "give up all his riches" in order to enter the Kingdom.</p>
<p>This idea of the cross being worked into our lives permeates every moment. The life of Christ is at once both resurrection and death.</p>
<p>Much of this work of the cross must take place in how we relate to one another. We are constantly faced with a need for God to bring us to the end of ourselves in friendships, families and jobs. Only then can He live through us as a good friend, a good mother or a good employee.</p>
<p>Although this value can be explained briefly, embracing it and allowing it to work in your life can be the most difficult of chores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Servanthood</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke 17:7-10 "But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say,"We are unprofitable servants:" we have done that which was our duty to do."</p>
<p>Most Christians are aware of the scripture which teaches that the greatest in the Kingdom is the servant of all. Most believers would claim that as a value. However, in keeping with modern culture, that servanthood is often a modification of humanistic philanthropy. That is, "Out of my abundance I will make a name for myself by giving to the poor and needy."</p>
<p>This common approach can be evidenced in church members by a desire to be recognized for what they do.</p>
<p>Biblical servants, on the other hand, are told, "when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say,"We are unprofitable servants:" we have done that which was our duty to do."</p>
<p>This value affects how people are motivated. On the one hand, servanthood can be motivated by humanistic desires. On the other hand, servanthood can result from joyous submission to the King of Kings.</p>
<p>In coming to an understanding of this type of servanthood, new members of Lexington Christian Fellowship often feel unappreciated or unnoticed. Being accustomed to recognition for what they could, these people miss affirmation for their good works.</p>
<p>Conversely, they have never been in a community where love and affirmation was an absolute fact based in core values. In other words, people are not loved for who they are and what they do. People are loved because we have been loved and filled with God's love.</p>
<p>Understanding this frees member to serve joyously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ in you</li>
</ul>
<p>Colossians 1:27 "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"</p>
<p>Philippians 2:13 "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."</p>
<p>The fact of the Christian life is Christ working in and through the believer. To put the heavy burden of the cross or servanthood on an unregenerate person would be certain failure. The only reason we believe that we can walk in these principles is because we believe that Christ is alive "in us."</p>
<p>Because of our understanding of life being lived "in Christ," we are pressed to grow in our relationship to Him. Teachings such as abiding, drawing life from God or walking in the Spirit are wrapped up in valuing the life of Christ that is in us.</p>
<p>While coming to the end of our own lives through embracing death to the old man, we move ahead with great faith for what God is doing in us through Christ.</p>
<p>The life of the Cross is not one of retreat. It is one that releases the power of the resurrected Christ to flow out of the believer's life.</p>
<p>Christ imparts gifting, grace, ability, courage and every good gift.</p>
<p>While understanding with Paul, "No good thing dwells in me, that is my flesh," members of Lexington Christian Fellowship also understand a life full of faith in what God is doing in us.</p>
<p>Believing that God is going to get glory through the church as a whole, we believe that the hope for that is Christ in each believer.</p>
<p>In character, we believe that the power of God can cause believers to walk in true holiness. In gifting, we believe that He manifests Himself in each believer according to His will. These two manifestations form the whole of Christ in us; who we are and what we do. It is all summed up in Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatherhood</li>
</ul>
<p>Ephesians 1:2-3 "Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ." Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"</p>
<p>Paul clarifies in his introduction to the Ephesian epistle that God is both our Father and the Father of Jesus.</p>
<p>From the Gospel of John, we learn that Jesus came to reveal God as Father. John 5:17, 17:1</p>
<p>In retrospect, we see the complete Old Testament as God preparing sons to rule and reign with Him.</p>
<p>From the beginning of time, we see that God determined that we would be His children with full inheritance. Ephesians 1:5</p>
<p>As to our eternal state, we understand that we will forever be His sons and daughters. Romans 8:15-17</p>
<p>Understanding relationship in the church must encompass this great revelation of God. Although He has been known by many names, Jesus called Him Father and taught His disciples to address Him in the same way.</p>
<p>Valuing the Fatherhood of God flavors Lexington Christian Fellowship with a sense of family. First, we understand God's dealings in our individual lives as those of a Father bringing children into full maturity in order to participate with Him in His purposes.</p>
<p>Being Fathered by God, we believe we are given a new perspective of one another and how we treat each other. As His Fatherhood is manifested through us, we have the compassion and wisdom of One who lives for the good of His children.</p>
<p>This also affects how we see authority in the church and in our homes. We do not see it as a political or governmental imperative. Instead, we see it as a patriarchal extension of God Himself.</p>
<p>As we value Fatherhood, we seek Him and learn more fully His Father's heart. We understand more clearly His purposes and ways when we look through the eyes of a Father. Of course, this makes our own parenting more tied to God's desire. We realize that we are participating with The Father in training His children.</p>
<p>As we move to developing child training and education, we do not believe that we must translate religious ideas into training ideas. Our religion is warp and woof a Father training His children.</p>
<ul>
<li>God's love to us</li>
</ul>
<p>1 John 4:10, 19 "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. We love him, because he first loved us."</p>
<p>Of course, all of this begins with God. None of this is instituted by man. We do not wake up one day and say, "I will be good." In the community of believers, we daily acknowledge that salvation belongs to the Lord.</p>
<p>This attitude of God's Sovereignty protects the community from humanism in its most deadly form--humanistic religion. This kind of religion teaches that we can build a tower to God.</p>
<p>It ends in every man speaking a different language and all sorts of confusion.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do about this. It is a fact. We cannot change it, we cannot increase it, we cannot influence it. We must resign our selves to it. God has loved us.</p>
<p>In other terms, we call this Grace.</p>
<p>Traditionally, grace is defined as "unmerited favor". God did not choose us according to our good works, but according to His good pleasure. God is the first cause of any true Christian Community.</p>
<p>Seeing these values as important, LCF has spent over twenty-five years letting them influence the development of their community. At no point have the members ever felt perfected in living these values. However, as a whole, they have always been our goal.</p>
<p>Each year we learn more fully what embracing the cross means. At every stage of growth we have had to sit back and seek God as to how the values would affect the next step.</p>
<p>In some areas we have been slower than others. In some areas we have made mistakes and been imbalanced. Fortunately, God has used even that in bringing us more into line with His desires. However, it must be said that God has had some success in us and the people of LCF feel an obligation to continue building according to the vision God has given.</p>
<p>If you believe that you have trained your children in the same values and are looking for a place to share your gifting while receiving from others in the Mars Hill community, please feel free to fill out an application and begin the process.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you do not embrace these values in the same way, we pray God's best for you and your family and ask for your prayers as well.</p>
