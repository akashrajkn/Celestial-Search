	    <p>A <b>takkanah</b> is a major legislative enactment within <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">halakha</a> (Jewish law), the normative system of <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism's</a> laws.</p>
<p>A <i>takkanah</i> is an enactment which (1) revises an ordinance that no longer satisfies the requirements of the times or circumstances, or which (2), being deduced from a Biblical passage, may be regarded as new. It is, therefore, the antithesis of the Gezerah. <i>Takkanot</i> (plural) were framed even in the time of the Second <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a>, those of unknown origin being ascribed to earlier leaders, and they have been promulgated at all subsequent periods of Jewish history. The term is applied also to the institution provided for in the enactment.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/t/a/k/Takkanah.html" title="Edit section: Introduction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Classical Jewish law granted <a href="../../../../articles/r/a/b/Rabbinic_literature.html" title="Rabbinic literature">rabbinic sages</a> wide legislative powers. There are two powerful legal tools within the halakhic system:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Gezeirah</i>: "preventative legislation" of the classical rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the <a href="../../../../articles/6/1/3/613_mitzvot.html" class="mw-redirect" title="613 mitzvot">|commandments</a></li>
<li><i>Takkanah</i>: "positive legislation", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the commandments as such.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the general term <i>takkanah</i> is used to refer to either gezeirot or takkanot.</p>
<p>Takkanot, in general, do not affect or restrict observance of Torah <i>mitzvot</i>. However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Jewish sages had the authority to "uproot matters from the Torah" in certain cases. In Talmudic and classical halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be biblically sanctioned (<i>shev v'al ta'aseh</i>). Rabbis may rule that a Torah mitzvah should not be performed, e.g. blowing the <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/o/Shofar.html" title="Shofar">shofar</a> on <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, or blessing the <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/u/Four_Species_1b99.html" title="Four Species">lulav and etrog</a> on Shabbat. These are takkanot are executed out of fear that some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/l/Melakha.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Melakha">melakha</a>.</p>
<p>Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the sages allowed the temporary violation a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/t/Esther.html" title="Esther">Esther's</a> relationship with <a href="../../../../articles/a/h/a/Ahasuerus.html" title="Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a>.

<p>Agriculture is permitted until the first day of the Sabbatical year (Tosef., Sheb. i.).</p>
<p>Takkanah ascribed to the court of Jabneh: the fourth benediction in the grace after meals in memory of those who fell at Bethar (Ber. 48b).</p>
<p>After R. Gamaliel's death the Sanhedrin of Jabneh seems to have gone to Usha (the modern AlUs) for reasons which are no longer known, and the grounds of its takkanot are equally obscure. In view of their ethical import, however, these enactments soon became binding. They were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>a man must support his minor children</li>
<li>if a man transfers his property to his sons, both he and his wife enjoy a life income from it</li>
<li>the gift of more than one-fifth of one's property for alms is forbidden</li>
<li>a father must deal gently with his son until the latter reaches the age of twelve; but after that age he may be severe with him</li>
<li>after a wife's death the husband may sell the property included in her dowry</li>
<li>one who attacks an old man must pay one pound of gold for the injury</li>
<li>elucidation of the seven doubtful reasons through which the terumah becomes unfit for use and must be burned (Ket. 49a, 50b; Yer. Ket. iv. 28b; M. Ḳ. 17a; Yer. M. Ḳ. iii. 8; Shab. 15b)</li>
</ol>
<p>These ordinances were enacted by the rabbis of the second generation of <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/n/Tannaim.html" title="Tannaim">tannaim</a>, Rabbi Ishmael being especially mentioned (B. B. 28b; Niddah 14b).</p>
<p>An ordinance is also extant which dates from the time called the period of religious persecution ("shemad"). When Hadrian issued his decree forbidding the Jews to observe their religion, the teachers, including R. Akiba, R. Tarfon, and R. Jose the Galilean, met in council and agreed that during the time of the persecution the Law might be transgressed in all respects, except as regarded the commands relating to idolatry, chastity, and morality, although this regulation was observed only superficially and only when necessary in order to deceive the Roman spies.</p>
<p>Three ordinances have been preserved which were promulgated by R. Jose b. Ḥalafta of Sepphoris, of the third generation of tannaim, who flourished about the middle of the second century. They are as follows: (1) during a funeral the mourners must remain standing while those who console them pass by (Sanh. 19a); (2) women living in lonely places must associate with one another, so as not to attract the attention and evil desire of any man (ib.); (3) a child accompanied by its mother must not lag behind on the road, lest it come to harm (ib.).</p>

<p>The following ordinances are ascribed to the last generation of tannaim (end of the second and beginning of the third century):</p>
<p>To R. Judah I., ha-Nasi: (1) messengers must be sent every month to announce the new moon to the Diaspora (R. H. 22b); (2) concerning the purchase of fields among the Sicarii (Giṭ. 55b); (3) on menstruation (Niddah 66a).</p>
<p>Ordinances from the period of the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> and relating to women are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>an orphan girl married during her minority may leave her husband without a bill of divorce on attaining her majority (Ket. 46b)</li>
<li>the permission to marry a feebleminded girl (Yeb. 112b)</li>

<li>orphan girls share the income from their father's estate until they reach their majority (ib. 52b); (12) male heirs succeed to the property of the mother, even after their father's death (ib. 52b);</li>
<li>the daughter is entitled to a certain portion of her father's estate as her dowry (ib. 67a); (14) a bill of divorce must be written and signed in the presence of the messenger who is to deliver it (Giṭ. i. 1); (15) the date must be given in all legal documents (ib. 17a); (16) in a bill of divorce the date must be given according to the state calendar (Giṭ. 79b; later it was also dated according to the era of Creation)</li>
<li>witnesses must sign a bill of divorce in the presence of each other (ib. 10a)</li>
<li>introduction of the "geṭ mekushshar" to make divorce more difficult (B. B. 160a)</li>
<li>a woman becomes free even though only a single witness testifies to her husband's death (Yeb. 87b).</li>

<p>The more the Jews came in contact with the Romans and the Persians, the more they were obliged to modify the letter of their laws, and to introduce ordinances of the class characterized as necessary (a) "for the preservation of the order of the world," or (b) "for the sake of peace."</p>
<p>The regulations of this type, like those already mentioned, date from the mishnaic period, and were promulgated for the sake of morality. In addition, there were other takkanot designed (c) to facilitate repentance and (d) to contribute to "the interests of the market" or of business.</p>

<p>Ordinances relating to legal proceedings, like those which governed the religious life, were highly important so long as the Jews retained their own judicial system in the Diaspora. These regulations fall, according to Bloch (l.c.), into three categories: ordinances relating (a) to commerce; (b) to civil law; and (c) to the oath. They are a form of <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/s/Business_ethics.html" title="Business ethics">business ethics</a>.
