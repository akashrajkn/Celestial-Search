<p>Beginning in <a href="../../../../articles/a/p/r/April_2004.html" title="April 2004">April 2004</a>, members of the <a href="../../../../articles/i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a> began taking <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/s/Hostage.html" title="Hostage">hostage</a> <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Foreign.html" title="Foreign">foreign</a> civilians in <a href="../../../../articles/i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Since then, they have <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/d/Kidnap.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Kidnap">kidnapped</a> more than 200 foreigners and thousands of Iraqis; among them, 30 foreign hostages have been killed. The motives behind these kidnappings include influencing foreign governments with troops in Iraq and foreign companies with workers there, as well as ransom money and discouraging travel to Iraq. In 2004, executions of captives were often filmed, and several were <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/h/Behead.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Behead">beheaded</a>. However, the number of videotaped killings has decreased significantly, and now the deaths of hostages are often announced only in a statement. Many hostages remain missing with no clue as to their whereabouts. The US Department of State <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/s/Hostage_Working_Group_310b.html" title="Hostage Working Group">Hostage Working Group</a> was organized by the US Embassy in Baghdad in the summer of 2004 to monitor hostages in Iraq.</p>
<p>The following is a list of known <b>foreign hostages in Iraq</b>.</p>
