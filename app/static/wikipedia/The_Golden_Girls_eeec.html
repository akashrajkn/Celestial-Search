Originally, the character of Sophia was intended to appear only sporadically, but Getty's portrayal proved so popular with test audiences that the decision was made to drop Coco, and hastily write Sophia into the earliest scripts (many of Sophia's famous zingers and <a href="../../../../articles/o/n/e/One_liner.html" class="mw-redirect" title="One liner">one liners</a> were originally written for the Coco character).

<p>Dorothy Zbornak (<a href="../../../../articles/n/%C3%A9/e/N%C3%A9e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Née">née</a> Petrillo) was an Italian Catholic, raised in <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a> by her mother Sophia and her father Salvadore (played in flashbacks by <a href="../../../../articles/s/i/d/Sid_Melton_b61f.html" title="Sid Melton">Sid Melton</a>). Nicknamed "Pussycat" by her mother, Dorothy had a younger brother and sister. Brother Phil, a cross-dresser, was often referred to but never seen. He later died of a heart attack in an episode featuring <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/e/Brenda_Vaccaro_96a8.html" title="Brenda Vaccaro">Brenda Vaccaro</a> as his widow. Sister Gloria, the youngest Petrillo sibling, married into money; she appeared in two episodes, but was played by two different actresses (<a href="../../../../articles/d/o/r/Doris_Belack_9ad5.html" title="Doris Belack">Doris Belack</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Dena_Dietrich_9294.html" title="Dena Dietrich">Dena Dietrich</a>). After moving to Miami in her later years, Dorothy continued working as a substitute teacher.</p>
<p>On the night of their high school prom, <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/Stanley_Zbornak_a697.html" title="Stanley Zbornak">Stanley Zbornak</a> got Dorothy pregnant and married her to <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/o/Shotgun_wedding.html" title="Shotgun wedding">legitimize the baby</a>. Stan and Dorothy were married for 38 years, although Stan cheated on her numerous times, finally leaving her for a young flight attendant named Chrissy, whom he met on the way to a business conference in <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. As Dorothy explained in one episode, the captain on the flight told the flight attendants to "give the passengers a <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Lei_%28Hawaii%29_7ee2.html" title="Lei (Hawaii)">lei</a>." Chrissy got confused (implying that she had sex with Stan), but she and Stan ended up marrying and living in <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/u/Maui.html" title="Maui">Maui</a>. Dorothy had two children, Kate and Michael, and a grandchild named Robbie. In the second season, an episode featuring a visit from Michael, Dorothy referred to him as being 29, which would make her 47, likely a miscalculation on the part of the writers. The following season when Michael came for a visit (in the episode "Mixed Blessings") to announce his engagement to Lorraine, Dorothy repeatedly said in one scene that Michael was only 23 and Lorraine was 44. In a season's time, Michael suddenly dropped 6 years of his life. Michael should have been 40-41 years old when that episode aired in order for Dorothy to have had given birth to him when she was 18-19 years old.</p>
<p>Though Dorothy and Stan were divorced, he made numerous appearances on the show (the character of Stan was portrayed by <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Herb_Edelman_875f.html" title="Herb Edelman">Herb Edelman</a>), usually running to Dorothy whenever something went wrong in his life. Stan continually saw Dorothy as a comforting, reliable figure; even though he was the one who destroyed their marriage. Dorothy emerged from the divorce a bitter and desperate woman, while her ex-husband seemed to descend further into childishness. Dorothy shot down all attempts of male companionship before beginning a relationship with the married gym teacher. This affair was short lived, but she was made a stronger and more confident woman for it. They ended up having a one-night stand in the first season (which Stan mistakenly thought would lead to a reconciliation), and, a few seasons later, started dating again with plans to re-marry. Dorothy called off the reconciliation on the day of the wedding when Stan asked her to sign a <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/e/Pre-nuptial_agreement.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Pre-nuptial agreement">pre-nuptial agreement</a>. (Dorothy's proud mother Sophia, who had never quite forgiven her "yutz" son-in-law for cheating on her daughter, proudly announced to the wedding guests: "She turned <i>him</i> down. Remember that!").</p>
<p>Toward the end of the series, <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/a/Beatrice_Arthur_ffd6.html" title="Beatrice Arthur">Beatrice Arthur</a> made it clear that she wanted out. This inevitably set the plot for the last first-run airing. In the series' final episode, Dorothy married Blanche's uncle Lucas Hollingsworth (played by <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/s/Leslie_Nielsen_a907.html" title="Leslie Nielsen">Leslie Nielsen</a>), making her <i>"Aunt"</i> Dorothy Hollingsworth. Stan, though saddened to see Dorothy move on to her new life without him, gave Dorothy his blessing while disguised as the limo driver who took her to the wedding.</p>

Typical stories focused on people with names such as Hans, Lars, or Sven, and various experiences with <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Herring.html" title="Herring">herring</a>. Though Rose was decidedly the mildest-mannered of all 4 roommates, she had an incredible competitive streak, which reared its head during several situations, most notably the bowling championship in the episode entitled "The Competition", and while coaching a boys' football team with Dorothy.</p>
<p>Rose spent the first few years of her life in an orphanage in St. Olaf. As discovered in one memorable episode, she spent much of her life convinced that <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> was her biological father. Toward the end of the series run, however, she learned she had been born out of wedlock to a monk (<a href="../../../../articles/d/o/n/Don_Ameche_c40e.html" title="Don Ameche">Don Ameche</a>) and his lover, Ingrid, who died in childbirth. At around age 8, Rose was adopted and raised by the large (and apparently somewhat bizarre) Lindstrom family. Her adoptive father had died prior to the start of the series, but in one episode she was visited by her free-spirited adoptive mother, Alma (played by veteran star <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/a/Jeanette_Nolan_972f.html" title="Jeanette Nolan">Jeanette Nolan</a>); she later died off screen during the course of the series. Rose was one of 9 siblings (once stating that her parents loved 'all 9 of us equally'); several were, like Rose, named after types of flowers. These included the two sisters who visited Rose in Miami: Lily, who was blind (played by <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polly_Holliday_9c1f.html" title="Polly Holliday">Polly Holliday</a>), and Holly (played by <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/g/Inga_Swenson_c18b.html" title="Inga Swenson">Inga Swenson</a>), a professional musician whom Rose could not stand, as she seemed to act, as Rose once stated "like such a jackass".</p>
<p>Rose was married for many years to traveling insurance salesman Charlie Nylund, who moonlighted as a horseshoe salesman, and had 5 children: three daughters (Kirsten, Bridgette, and Jeanella) and two sons (Adam and Charlie Jr.) Kirsten and Bridgette would visit their mother in Miami on more than one occasion, while Adam; Charlie Jr.; and Jeanella were mentioned but never seen on the show. Rose had several grandchildren, including two granddaughters, Charley and Charlene (the former appeared on the <i>The Golden Girls</i> and the latter of whom visited Rose in <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Golden_Palace_4911.html" title="The Golden Palace">The Golden Palace</a></i>).</p>
<p>After Charlie's death in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> (he died of a heart attack while they were making love), Rose lived alone in St. Olaf for a while, and then she moved to Miami and found work at a grief counseling center. During the show's run, Charlie's pension was cut off, and Rose was forced to find a more lucrative job, ending up as the assistant to consumer reporter Enrique Mas at a local TV station. Over the course of the series, Rose also volunteered at the local hospital, and worked on a number of charity projects.</p>
<p>In later seasons, Rose became romantically involved with college professor Miles Webber (played by <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harold_Gould_2b89.html" title="Harold Gould">Harold Gould</a>) Rose later discovered that Miles was part of the <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/t/Witness_Protection_Program_1e74.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Witness Protection Program">Witness Protection Program</a>). Webber was stated as previously being known as Nicholas Carbone, an accountant from Chicago. After a gangster named Mickey "The Cheeseman" Moran faked his own death, Miles was briefly re-located to Pennsylvania as an Amish farmer named Samuel Plankmaker. Incidentally, the same <a href="../../../../articles/a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> who played Miles also played "Arnie", one of Rose's brief love interests in the first season.</p>
<p>After the show's run, when the girls sold the house and bought a hotel (<i>The Golden Palace</i>), Rose was the wedding consultant for the hotel. She also was in charge of handling all banquets, conferences, and affairs for the hotel. While she was handling a wedding reception for a bride and setting up the special "Cow-Themed Wedding", Miles' name was found in the hotel registry several times, having checked in several times with another woman. Blanche informs Rose what she has found, Rose confronts Miles with the information, and it comes out that he's not the Miles Webber that was in the hotel registry. Miles did admit he was seeing another woman who worked in a restaurant, and that he couldn't choose between them. Rose ends the relationship stating that, after all they'd been through, if he wasn't sure she's the one that he wants to spend the rest of his life with, then he'll never know. Later on, Rose finds out the bride who is having the special "Cow-Themed Wedding", which has always been Rose's dream wedding (for her and Miles), is planning to marry Miles. At the end of the episode, Rose is in the hotel kitchen looking into the banquet room during the wedding ceremony. Rose tells Blanche that she has to be there in order to say goodbye and have closure.</p>
<p>Rose suffered from a number of health problems during the course of the show, most notably a massive heart attack during the show's final season. In one episode, it was also indicated that Rose had been addicted to painkillers for many years, having been prescribed a drug many years earlier after a farm injury. Also, in an episode entitled "72 Hours", Rose is informed that a blood transfusion she received during a routine surgery was possibly infected with <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>. After undergoing some routine tests, and anxiously waiting for 3 days, she is determined to be HIV-negative.</p>
<p>In honor of the character, the real-life <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/2E/St._Olaf_Township%2C_Minnesota_a158.html" title="St. Olaf Township, Minnesota">township of St. Olaf</a> created the Rose Nylund Award for Civic Excellence.</p>

<p>Blanche Devereaux (née Hollingsworth) was a <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Southern_belle.html" title="Southern belle">Southern belle</a> who grew up on a <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> outside of <a href="../../../../articles/a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Blanche was always "the apple of her father's eye" (she referred to him as "Big Daddy," a reference to the <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/n/Tennessee_Williams_62c5.html" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> character Harvey 'Big Daddy' Pollitt in <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/t/Cat_On_A_Hot_Tin_Roof_ac1b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Cat On A Hot Tin Roof">Cat On A Hot Tin Roof</a>). However, she tried many times to spin his affection for her as more negative. Blanche had a love-hate relationship with her sisters Charmaine (<a href="../../../../articles/b/a/r/Barbara_Babcock_5082.html" title="Barbara Babcock">Barbara Babcock</a>) and Virginia (<a href="../../../../articles/s/h/e/Sheree_North_540d.html" title="Sheree North">Sheree North</a>). She also faced difficulty coming to terms with the homosexuality of her brother Clayton (<a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monte_Markham_4545.html" title="Monte Markham">Monte Markham</a>), and the mental illness of her brother Tad (<a href="../../../../articles/n/e/d/Ned_Beatty_40e3.html" title="Ned Beatty">Ned Beatty</a>), later revealed in <i>The Golden Palace</i>.</p>
<p>The house that the ladies shared, at 6151 Richmond St., initially belonged to Blanche, who had lived there for many years with her late husband George (played in flashbacks by <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Grizzard_8bd9.html" title="George Grizzard">George Grizzard</a>). (Later in the series, however, she sold equal shares of the house to Dorothy, Rose, and Sophia.) Blanche and George had 4 children: two daughters (Rebecca and Janet, both of whom made appearances on the show), and four sons (including Matthew, a CPA who appeared in the spin-off series <i>The Golden Palace</i>. Blanche had an estranged relationship with both of her daughters. Rebecca resented her for objecting to her plans to leave school to become a model in Paris; when she returned to visit for the first time in four years, she was now overweight, which Blanche had difficulty accepting at first. Rebecca (now played by a slimmer actress) returned later on in the series. Janet resents Blanche for her lack of involvement in her life growing up, a fact that Blanche laments to this day regarding all of her children. Blanche had several grandchildren, notably David (a teenage rebel who visited Miami in one episode), Sara (who visited with her mother Janet during the last season), Melissa (a young beauty-pageant contestant), and Aurora (Rebecca's infant daughter, conceived by artificial insemination in one of the series' on-going storylines). Blanche acted as Rebecca's birthing coach in the delivery and the experience helped further heal their relationship.</p>
<p>George Devereaux's illegitimate son, David (played by <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Mark_Moses_426f.html" title="Mark Moses">Mark Moses</a>), the fifth Devereaux child, was discovered when the young man turned up at the house, looking for George. This led Blanche to struggle with the fact that her husband, to whom she was devoted, was unfaithful during their marriage.</p>
<p>Throughout most of the series, Blanche was portrayed as man-hungry, and she clearly had the most male admirers -- and stories detailing various sexual encounters -- over the course of the series. At the funeral for her husband, George (who had died when a wrong-way driver hit him head-on [there was once an episode where George was thought to be alive, but we later find out that the whole episode was just Blanche's dream. She wakes up and is comforted by the girls.]), she made a date with a man because, as Rose said, "She can't be without a man, do you know what I mean?" Sophia, in particular, had some of the best lines in relation to Blanche's over-sexed nature, referring to her as a "human mattress". When Dorothy asked Blanche how long she waited to have sex after George died, Sophia responded, "'Til the paramedics came!"</p>
<p>Blanche was very vain, and as a result, always tried to act younger than she was. Although it is widely believed that her exact age was never revealed (it was mentioned she even had her true date of birth removed from vital records "by order of the Governor"), in Season 3, Episode 25 entitled "Mother's Day" (Aired <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>), it is revealed in a flashback that Blanche was 17 in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. That would make her 53 when the series began in 1985, and 61 when the spin-off ended in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>.</p>
<p>Blanche was employed at an art museum, and her boss was Mr. Allen, a very nice man, although he admitted to having an affair with his best friend's wife in an episode when Dorothy came to work at the museum, sparking jealousy in Blanche, which was an on-going trait of hers.</p>
<p>Blanche's unapologetic enjoyment of sex contributed to some of the best dialogue on the show. For example:</p>
<p>Blanche: "Do you know what I hate doing most after a party?"<br />
Rose: "Trying to find your underwear in the big pile?"</p>
<p>Sophia: "Is it true what they say about black men in the bedroom?<br />
Blanche: "Oh yes definitely... that is definitely something I would like to know too."</p>

<p>Sophia Petrillo is the daughter of Don Angelo and his wife Eleanor from Sicily. Sophia was born in <a href="../../../../articles/s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and moved to New York after annulling her first (arranged) marriage to Guido Spirelli (she was also briefly engaged to a young man from her village, Augustine Bagatelli, as a teenager). She married Salvador Petrillo (<a href="../../../../articles/s/i/d/Sid_Melton_b61f.html" title="Sid Melton">Sid Melton</a>), and they had three children: Dorothy, a <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/v/Divorced.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Divorced">divorced</a> <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/b/Substitute_Teacher_4e36.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Substitute Teacher">substitute Teacher</a> whom Sophia depended upon and came to live with; Phil, a <a href="../../../../articles/c/r/o/Cross-dressing.html" title="Cross-dressing">cross-dresser</a> who was married with kids; and Gloria, who married into wealth, but eventually lost the fortune that her deceased husband left her.</p>
<p>Sophia was put away in the Shady Pines Retirement Village by Dorothy prior to the start of the series. Sophia had suffered a massive stroke, which, on more than one occasion, was said to have destroyed the part of her brain that acted as a censor; indeed, much of Sophia's popularity comes from her humorous, and often shocking, frankness and general lack of inhibition. In the pilot episode, she came to live with the <i>Girls</i> after Shady Pines burned down. In a later episode, Sophia tried to run away to Sicily after becoming the prime suspect in starting the fire after making s'mores with a roommate on an illegal hotplate. Sophia never had good things to say about her retirement home, and she alluded to poor treatment by the staff many times throughout the series' run (although, in an episode meant to raise awareness about poor-quality nursing homes, she did admit that the treatment at Shady Pines was satisfactory). There were constant hints in the series that she and her family back in Sicily had some <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">mafia</a> connections; she once stated that she had lived through "two world wars, 15 vendettas, 4 operations and <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/r/Darrin_Syndrome_6679.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Darrin Syndrome">two Darrins</a> on <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>". In one episode, she accidentally let it slip that she knew what happened to <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jimmy_Hoffa_c99c.html" title="Jimmy Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>.</p>
<p>Members of Sophia's family who appeared on show include: her sister Angela (played by <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/n/Nancy_Walker_87f4.html" title="Nancy Walker">Nancy Walker</a>), her brother Angelo (played by <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Dana_%28comedian%29_9ca2.html" title="Bill Dana (comedian)">Bill Dana</a>), her daughter Gloria (played by <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/r/Doris_Belack_9ad5.html" title="Doris Belack">Doris Belack</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Dena_Dietrich_9294.html" title="Dena Dietrich">Dena Dietrich</a>), and, in flashbacks, her husband Sal, her mother (played by Bea Arthur), and her father (also played by Bill Dana), and Dorothy herself at a younger age (played by Lyn Greene). Phil, her only son, was <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/s/Unseen_character.html#Television_programs" title="Unseen character">never seen</a>; he died later on in the series when he suffered a heart attack (due to his obesity) while trying on large women's clothing (even in his wake, Phil is referred to as wearing women's clothing.) In the episode "Ebbtide's Revenge", after her son's funeral, Sophia (with the help of Dorothy's no-nonsense personality and Rose's caring counseling expertise from her grief counseling center job), finally realized the root of her anger, broke into tears, and ended the long feud with Phil's wife Angela (played by <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/e/Brenda_Vaccaro_96a8.html" title="Brenda Vaccaro">Brenda Vaccaro</a>). It is revealed that Sophia was angry at herself because she wondered what she had done or said to her son to make him want to be a cross-dresser, and is finally able to reconcile with Angela after coming to the realization that she still loved him and in one of Sophia's few true emotional moments says "My baby is gone." Sophia always referred to Angela as "Big Sally", because it got on Angela's nerves. Phil, Angela, and their children lived in a trailer home in <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/Newark%2C_New_Jersey_17a7.html" title="Newark, New Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>. During the series' run, Sophia married Max Weinstock (played by <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jack_Gilford_a352.html" title="Jack Gilford">Jack Gilford</a>), Sal's business partner, and attempted to revive Sal and Max's old pizza-and-knish business at the beach, but they soon separated, realizing they were better off as friends "with occasional benefits". Throughout the series, she held a few part-time jobs mostly involving food including fast-food worker and entrepreneur of spaghetti sauce and specialty sandwiches.</p>

<p>Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of conflict or problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/e/Cheesecake.html" title="Cheesecake">cheesecake</a> and/or some other dessert. One of the other girls would then tell a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose would occasionally regale a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia would tell outrageous made-up stories). Sophia always began her stories with "picture it...", before indicating the location and year in which her story took place. Blanche's stories usually revolved around her romantic encounters or her years growing up in the South, while Rose's stories came from her time in her hometown of St. Olaf, and often began with "Back in St Olaf...". Certain episodes would also feature a series of flashbacks, as the girls recounted experiences from their time together. By the end of the episode, the conflict would be resolved. Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. These earlier flashbacks usually featured Sophia living in Brooklyn with her husband, Sal, and featured Estelle Getty without her usual wig and appearing much younger in different make-up.</p>

<p>An immediate run-away hit, <i>The Golden Girls</i> became a staple of <a href="../../../../articles/m/u/s/Must_See_TV_6705.html" title="Must See TV">NBC's Must See TV</a> on Saturday nights. The show was the anchor of the Saturday line-up, and routinely won its time slot, as the other networks tried to find shows to compete against it. <i>The Golden Girls</i> was part of a series of <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/a/Brandon_Tartikoff_01f2.html" title="Brandon Tartikoff">Brandon Tartikoff</a> shows that revitalized <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s ratings slump, along with <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Cosby_Show_5174.html" title="The Cosby Show">The Cosby Show</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/l/a/_/LA_Law_040a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="LA Law">LA Law</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>The Golden Girls</i> had a loyal fan base that still exists to this day, thanks to reruns. The show was often controversial, as its main characters were 4 single older women who lived together, but were still sexually active, and up-to-date with pop culture. Mild profanity and sexual innuendo were common on the program. The effects of Sophia's <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>, which, according to Dorothy, "rendered her a complete burden", enabled the character to get away with much more than the other women.</p>

<p>After six consecutive seasons in the top 10, and a seventh season at #30, <i>The Golden Girls</i> came to an end when Bea Arthur decided it was time to move on. In the hour-long finale, which aired in May 1992, Dorothy marries Blanche's Uncle Lucas (<a href="../../../../articles/l/e/s/Leslie_Nielsen_a907.html" title="Leslie Nielsen">Leslie Nielsen</a>), and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in <a href="../../../../articles/a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Presumably, Sophia was to join her, but, in the end, Sophia stays behind with the other girls in <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/a/Miami.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Miami">Miami</a>. In the bittersweet final moments, Dorothy comes rushing back in through different entrances of the house for their final goodbyes, until making her final exit, leaving the other three ladies alone. The finale garnered 27.2 million viewers (38 percent of all Americans watching television at the time).</p>

<p>A 1987 episode of <i>The Golden Girls</i>, titled "<a href="../../../../articles/e/m/p/Empty_Nests_78c5.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Empty Nests">Empty Nests</a>", featured guest stars <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/u/Paul_Dooley_6c89.html" title="Paul Dooley">Paul Dooley</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/t/Rita_Moreno_7b54.html" title="Rita Moreno">Rita Moreno</a> as George and Renee Corliss, a married couple living next to the Golden Girls and facing <a href="../../../../articles/e/m/p/Empty_nest_syndrome.html" title="Empty nest syndrome">empty nest syndrome</a> after their three adult daughters had moved out. The episode was intended to launch a <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/i/Spinoff.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Spinoff">spinoff</a> series, but viewer response to the characters was not favorable, and the new show's premise was re-tooled.</p>
<p>The following year <i><a href="../../../../articles/e/m/p/Empty_Nest_%28TV_series%29_4566.html" title="Empty Nest (TV series)">Empty Nest</a></i> debuted, starring <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Mulligan_46bd.html" title="Richard Mulligan">Richard Mulligan</a> as pediatrician Harry Weston, a widower whose two adult daughters had moved back home. One supporting actor from the original episode, <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/v/David_Leisure_060b.html" title="David Leisure">David Leisure</a>, was retained in the new series, although his character, another neighbor of the Westons', was also re-named. Although the show did not feature the same characters who had appeared in "Empty Nests", the Westons' home was the same home used in the original episode. Characters from both shows made occasional guest appearances on the other show.</p>
<p><i>Empty Nest</i> launched its own spin-off in 1991, <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/u/r/Nurses_%28TV_series%29_8060.html" title="Nurses (TV series)">Nurses</a></i>, set in the same hospital where Dr. Weston worked. As one of the few times in television history that three shows from the same producer, set in the same city, aired back-to- back-to-back on a single network in the same night, the three shows occasionally took advantage of their unique circumstances to create storylines that carried through all three series, such as "Hurricane Saturday". This was one of the major factors in the popularity of <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/c/Fictional_crossover.html" title="Fictional crossover">fictional crossovers</a> as a television plot device in the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>

<p>The house's address was mentioned as being 6151 Richmond St. in Miami, although no such street or address exists in that city.</p>
<p>The outside model used in the shots of the house in the series was part of the backstage studio tour ride at Disney/MGM studios. This façade — along with the <i>Empty Nest</i> house — was among those destroyed in Summer 2003, as Disney bulldozed the homes of "Residential Street" to make room for its "Lights, Motors, Action!" attraction. The façade was reportedly based on a real home in or near <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/c/Pacific_Palisades%2C_California_5eb9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Pacific Palisades, California">Pacific Palisades, California</a>. The real house was seen in the first season's exterior shots. It was after this that the model was built at Disney World.</p>
<p>The interior shots of the house, obviously a <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Soundstage.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Soundstage">soundstage</a>, do not make any logical architectural sense in the real world. The narrow, diagonal hallway that led to the characters' bedrooms was far too close in angle to the space of the kitchen (and the supposed location of the garage) to contain any rooms that even approach the size of those shown in bedroom scenes. In fact, for the first few episodes, Blanche's bedroom was accessed through the large opening at the front of the house, later deemed the entrance to the "lanai" patio. The doors down the hallway led to different Girls' bedrooms, depending on the specific episode as well, although Blanche's bedroom was always the last door at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>Before filming the first episode, Arthur carved a small niche into the house's front door, in the shape of an <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/c/Exclamation_point.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Exclamation point">exclamation point</a>.
