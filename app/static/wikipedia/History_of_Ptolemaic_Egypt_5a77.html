<p>All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name "Ptolemy", while princesses and queens preferred the names <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/e/Cleopatra.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Berenice.html" title="Berenice">Berenice</a>. Because the Ptolemaic kings adopted the Egyptian custom of marrying their sisters, many of the kings ruled jointly with their spouses, who were also of the royal house. This custom made Ptolemaic politics confusingly incestuous, and the later Ptolemies were increasingly feeble. The only Ptolemaic Queens to officially rule on their own were <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Berenice_III_of_Egypt_1ced.html" title="Berenice III of Egypt">Berenice III</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Berenice_IV_of_Egypt_9629.html" title="Berenice IV of Egypt">Berenice IV</a>. <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/e/Cleopatra_V_of_Egypt_d626.html" title="Cleopatra V of Egypt">Cleopatra V</a> did co-rule, but it was with another female, Berenice IV. <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/e/Cleopatra_VII_2fbb.html" title="Cleopatra VII">Cleopatra VII</a> officially co-ruled with <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator_8587.html" title="Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator">Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_XIV_of_Egypt_c72e.html" title="Ptolemy XIV of Egypt">Ptolemy XIV</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_XV_of_Egypt_44ae.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Ptolemy XV of Egypt">Ptolemy XV</a>, but effectively, she ruled Egypt alone.</p>

<p>The early Ptolemies did not disturb the religion or the customs of the <a href="../../../../articles/e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>, and indeed built magnificent new temples for the Egyptian gods and soon adopted the outward display of the Pharaohs of old (<i>illustration, left</i>). During the reign of Ptolemies II and III thousands of Greek veterans were rewarded with grants of farm lands, and Greeks were planted in colonies and garrisons or settled themselves in the villages throughout the country. Upper Egypt, farthest from the centre of government, was less immediately affected, though Ptolemy I established the Greek colony of <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemais_Hermiou_f44d.html" title="Ptolemais Hermiou">Ptolemais Hermiou</a> to be its capital, but within a century <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greek</a> influence had spread through the country and intermarriage had produced a large Greco-Egyptian educated class. Nevertheless, the Greeks always remained a privileged minority in Ptolemaic Egypt. They lived under Greek law, received a Greek education, were tried in Greek courts, and were citizens of Greek cities, just as they had been in <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greece</a>. The Egyptians were rarely admitted to the higher levels of Greek culture, in which most Egyptians were not in any case interested.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> now formed the new upper classes in <a href="../../../../articles/e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, replacing the old native aristocracy. In general, the Ptolemies undertook changes that went far beyond any other measures that earlier foreign rulers had imposed. They used the religion and traditions to increase their own power and wealth. Although they established a prosperous kingdom, enhanced with fine buildings, the native population enjoyed few benefits, and there were frequent uprisings. These expressions of nationalism reached a peak in the reign of <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_IV_Philopator_fb1e.html" title="Ptolemy IV Philopator">Ptolemy IV Philopator</a> (221–205 BC) when others gained control over one district and ruled as a line of native "pharaohs."

During this period, Greek troops under <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_I_Soter_da53.html" title="Ptolemy I Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a> were given land grants and brought their families encouraging tens of thousands of <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> to settle the country making themselves the new ruling class. Native <a href="../../../../articles/e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> continued having a role, yet a small one in the Ptolemaic government mostly in lower posts and outnumbered the foreigners. During the reign of the Ptolemaic Pharoahs, many <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/w/Jews.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Jews">Jews</a> were imported from neighboring Palestine by the hundred thousands for being renowned fighters and established an important presence there. Other foreign groups settled during this time even <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/l/Galatian.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Galatian">Galatian</a> mercernaries were invited in.</p>

<p>Of all ruling entities to come and settle upon Egypt, the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> were the most important element. They were partly spread as allotment-holders over the country, forming social groups, in the country towns and villages, side by side with the native population, partly gathered in the three Greek cities — the old Naucratis, founded before 600 B.C. (in the interval of Egyptian independence after the expulsion of the Assyrians and before the coming of the Persians), and the two new cities, Alexandria by the sea, and Ptolemais in <a href="../../../../articles/u/p/p/Upper_Egypt_1281.html" title="Upper Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>. Alexander and his <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/l/Seleucid.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> successors were great as the founders of Greek cities all over their dominions; <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greek_culture.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Greek culture">Greek culture</a> was so much bound up with the life of the city-state that any king who wanted to present himself to the world as a genuine champion of <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a> had to do something in this direction, but the king of <a href="../../../../articles/e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, whilst he was as ambitious as any to shine as a <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Hellene.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hellene">Hellene</a>, would find Greek cities, with their republican tradition and aspirations to independence, inconvenient elements in a country which lent itself, as no other did, to bureaucratic centralization. The Ptolemies therefore limited the number of Greek city-states in Egypt to those three — <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemais.html" title="Ptolemais">Ptolemais</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/u/Naucratis.html" title="Naucratis">Naucratis</a>. Outside Egypt, as we have seen, they had Greek cities under their dominion — the old Greek cities in the <a href="../../../../articles/c/y/r/Cyrenaica.html" title="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, in <a href="../../../../articles/c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, on the coasts and islands of the Aegean — but in Egypt no more than the three. There were indeed country towns with names such as Ptolemais, Arsinoe, and Berenice, in which Greek communities existed with a certain social life; there were similar groups of Greeks in many of the old Egyptian towns, but they were not communities with the political forms of a city-state. Yet if they had no place of political assembly, they would have their gymnasium, the essential sign of Hellenism, serving something of the purpose of a university for the young men. Far up the Nile at Ombi we find in 136‑135 B.C. a gymnasium of the local Greeks, which passes resolutions and corresponds with the king. And in 123 B.C., when there is trouble in Upper Egypt between the towns of <a href="../../../../articles/c/r/o/Crocodilopolis.html" title="Crocodilopolis">Crocodilopolis</a> and Hermonthis, the negotiators sent from Crocodilopolis are the young men attached to the gymnasium, who, according to the Greek tradition, eat bread and salt with the negotiators from the other town.</p>
<p>All the <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_dialects_159e.html" title="Ancient Greek dialects">Greek dialects</a> of the Greek world gradually became asimilated in the <a href="../../../../articles/k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a> dialect which was the common language of the <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Hellenistic_world.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hellenistic world">Hellenistic world</a>. Generally the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> of the Ptolemaic Egypt felt like a representative of a higher civilization yet were curious over the native culture of Egypt.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/h/i/s/History_of_Ptolemaic_Egypt_5a77.html" title="Edit section: Jews of Egypt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jews of Egypt</span></h3>
<p>The largest foreign element after the Greek was the Jewish population. At the time of the <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christian_era.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Christian era">Christian era</a> the Jews in Egypt may have come to number about a million <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> out of a total population of about seven and a half millions. The Jews of Alexandria were, no doubt, like the Greeks of Alexandria, engaged in various kinds of trade and industry, but large numbers of the Jews in Egypt had been imported as soldiers. The <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/c/Maccabean_revolt.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Maccabean revolt">Maccabean revolt</a> and the wars of the Hasmonaean kings proved how formidable the Jews could be as fighters. The Elephantine Aramaic papyri have shown us Jewish soldiers of the Persian king established near the first cataract long before Alexander came to Egypt. Perhaps semi-paganized Jewish communities of this type had been absorbed, and ceased to exist as a separate people, before the end of the Persian period, but it seems likely that Ptolemy I found a Jewish element still existing in Egypt when he took over the obscure.</p>
<p>Sir Flinders Petrie refers to a Jewish tomb, opposite <a href="../../../../articles/o/x/y/Oxyrhyncus.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Oxyrhyncus">Oxyrhyncus</a>, discovered in 1922, with a long <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/a/Aramaic.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> inscription, belonging to the middle of the 5th century. In any case, when Palestine had been united to their kingdom by the Ptolemies, a fresh stream of immigration from Judaea to Egypt naturally followed. It was not only voluntary immigration. Regarding the Jews as good material for his army, Ptolemy I had transported masses of them to Egypt — 100,000, according to Pseudo-Aristeas, who says that he put 30,000 of them "in the garrisons" — settled them, we may perhaps understand, like the Greeks and Macedonians, on the land.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Inscriptions and papyri give us traces of this Jewish population in the country towns of Egypt throughout the Ptolemaic period.</p>
<p>The language of the Egyptian Jews was <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>; after a generation or two immigrants from Palestine forgot their Semitic speech <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>. Their Hebrew scriptures they knew only in the Greek translation, which was named the Septuagint because, according to the legend, the translation had been made by the Seventy Translators under Ptolemy II <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>. Since the Seventy Translators were held to have been themselves miraculously inspired, there was no need for the Egyptian Jews to concern themselves with the original Hebrew. As a matter of fact, the translation of the <a href="../../../../articles/o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> was made, bit by bit, in Egypt during the last three centuries before the <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christian_era.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Christian era">Christian era</a>. According to the first form of the legend, it was not the Old Testament as a whole, but only the five books of the Law which were translated by the Seventy <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>, and it is likely that a Greek version of the Law really was required by the Egyptian Jews as early as the reign of <a href="../../../../articles/p/t/o/Ptolemy_II_e5bb.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Ptolemy II">Ptolemy II</a>. In the latter times of the dynasty it made an important difference to any one who ruled Egypt, or aspired to rule it, if he had the Jews on his side.</p>
<p>Whether the <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/w/Jews.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Jews">Jews</a> at Alexandria were, or were not, included in the citizen-body of Alexandrines is, as has been said, a debated question. It seems really to resolve itself into a question of terms — what is meant by "citizenship" — the Jews plainly had certain peculiar privileges, on the strength of which they might claim to count as Alexandrine citizens, whilst they lacked other ordinary characteristics of citizenship, the absence of which might justify the Greek Alexandrines in denying them the name. As a community in Alexandria, they had a measure of self-government not conceded to any other community within a Greek <a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-state</a>. Their chief in early Roman times (and perhaps in Ptolemaic times) had the title of genarches or <a href="../../../../articles/e/t/h/Ethnarches.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Ethnarches">ethnarches</a>. In Roman times the government of the community was vested in a senate (gerusia), and this, too, may go back to the earlier period. The archontes seem to have been a committee of the senate. But the only title for the rulers of the community for which we have documentary evidence in the Ptolemaic period is that of Elders.</p>
<p>The Jewish quarter, Delta, adjoined the palace quarter on the north-east and reached down to the sea. Insofar as it lay beyond the harbour, it might be spoken of by enemies of the Jews contemptuously, as an out‑of-the‑way wretched sort of place, whilst the Jews might retort that its sea-front and its proximity to the royal palace made it pleasant and honourable. It was not a ghetto, inasmuch as there was no compulsion upon the Jews to live in the Delta quarter; many, as a matter of fact, lived in other parts of the city. But the Delta quarter was mainly inhabited by Jews, who had gathered there by choice.</p>
<p>There were naturally a number of synagogues in Alexandria for a community so large. The principal synagogue was in Roman times one of the most impressive in the Empire, a magnificent building in the style of a Greek basilica, described with pride in the Talmud, so large that the voice of the officiating minister could not reach the more distant part of the congregation, and a man had to be stationed half-way down the building with a flag, to signal the moments for saying Amen. But we have in Ptolemaic times the mention of synagogues at Alexandria — one built on behalf of the famous Cleopatra and Ptolemy Caesar "to the Great God who heareth", by a certain Alypus, a rich member, no doubt, of the Jewish community</p>

To this end the Roman administration made no change to the Ptolemaic system of government, although Romans replaced Greeks in the highest offices. But Greeks continued to staff most of the administrative offices and Greek remained the language of government except at the highest levels. Unlike the Greeks, the Romans did not settle in Egypt in large numbers. Culture, education and civic life largely remained Greek throughout the Roman period. The Romans, like the Ptolemies, respected and protected Egyptian religion and customs, although the cult of the Roman state and of the Emperor was gradually introduced.</p>

<p>The early Ptolemies increased cultivatable land through irrigation and introduced crops such as cotton and better wine-producing grapes. They also increased the availability of luxury goods through foreign trade. They enriched themselves and absorbed Egyptian culture. Ptolemy and his descendants adopted Egyptian royal trappings and added Egypt's religion to their own, worshiping Egyptian gods and building temples to them, and even being mummified and buried in sarcophagi covered with hieroglyphs</p>
