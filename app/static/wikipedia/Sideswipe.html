Sideswipe</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sideswipe was part of the initial crew of Autobots aboard the Ark when it crash-landed on Earth four million years ago. He awakened along with his fellow Transformers in 1984, with both he and brother being reformatted into <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/m/Lamborghini.html" title="Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a> sports cars. Sideswipe loaned <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> the use of his rocket pack when the Decepticons nearly escaped from Earth with a starship full of energon.</p>
<p>Sideswipe and Sunstreaker often operated together. When antimatter-fueled Decepticons attacked the Ark on one occasion in episode "Roll for It", Sideswipe and Sunstreaker took to the air to battle with the incoming seeker jets, in a rambunctious, if ultimately ineffective, display of "<i>jet judo.</i>"</p>
<p>When investigating tremors that were shaking the Autobot base, <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/e/Wheeljack.html" title="Wheeljack">Wheeljack</a>'s scanner found some interesting objects inside a rock wall. Sideswipe, using his piston-like arms, helped <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/a/Brawn_%28Transformers%29_2b23.html" title="Brawn (Transformers)">Brawn</a> removed the rock wall and found a cave full of dinosaur bones, the discovery of which would lead to the development of the <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/n/Dinobots.html" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>.</p>

Sideswipe disguised as the Stunticon Breakdown.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Towards the end of 1985, Sideswipe was a semi-regular in the series, and is among the team of five Autobots who disguised themselves as the <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/u/Stunticons.html" title="Stunticons">Stunticons</a>. Penetrating the Decepticons' camp, the Autobots ran into trouble when the real Stunticons arrived, trying to prove their identities by forming Menasor. With a combination of <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/n/Windcharger.html" title="Windcharger">Windcharger</a>'s magnetic powers and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/r/Mirage_%28Transformers%29_ca6c.html" title="Mirage (Transformers)">Mirage</a>'s illusion-creating ability, the Autobots were able to appear as Menasor too, but the deception was soon revealed, though they were still able to thwart the Decepticons' plans.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Transformers%7E_The_Movie_6230.html" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i>, the dead body of a robot many fans believe to be Sideswipe appears in the left corner of the frame as <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/r/Springer_%28Transformers%29_d6d0.html" title="Springer (Transformers)">Springer</a> attempts to move a torpedo launcher into place during the Battle of <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/t/Autobot_City_86ab.html" title="Autobot City">Autobot City</a>. However, this is incorrect; the robot in question is actually <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/e/Wheeljack.html" title="Wheeljack">Wheeljack</a> (whose body appears next to <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/n/Windcharger.html" title="Windcharger">Windcharger</a>'s a few seconds later into the scene), mistakenly colored like Sideswipe (The storyboards in this scene show Smokescreen's body and not Wheeljack's). In fact, Sideswipe does not appear at all in the movie, nor does he appear in any post-movie episodes of the <i>Transformers</i> television series.</p>
<p>However, there was a scene planned where he, Red Alert and <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/a/Tracks_%28Transformers%29_9705.html" title="Tracks (Transformers)">Tracks</a> hop off <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> to attack <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Constructicons.html" title="Constructicons">Devastator</a>, but they all flee and Red Alert is shot in the back and killed. Whether or not Sideswipe was intended to be killed himself is unknown.</p>
<p>Sideswipe appears in the first two episodes of the Japanese series <i><a href="../../../../articles/h/e/a/Transformers%7E_Headmasters_d426.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Transformers: Headmasters">Transformers: Headmasters</a></i>, participating with <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a>, the <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/a/Trainbots.html" title="Trainbots">Trainbots</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a> on a shootout against the <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/i/Triple_Changers_96c6.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Triple Changers">Triple Changers</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/i/x/Sixshot.html" title="Sixshot">Sixshot</a>. During a segment of this intense shootout, Sideswipe manages to hit <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/e/Frenzy_%28Transformers%29_4a91.html" title="Frenzy (Transformers)">Frenzy</a> and later, after foiling a new Decepticon assault, has also a line. So, Japanese transformers guides report that Sideswipe survived in someway the movie.</p>

<p>In the original <i>Marvel Transformers</i> comics, Sideswipe's role was largely similar to that of the animated series, serving as a loyal warrior under Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>Sideswipe joined the list of the long-term injured during the <i>Dinobot Hunt</i>. He was charged, along with <a href="../../../../articles/s/i/l/Silverstreak.html" title="Silverstreak">Bluestreak</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/f/Huffer_%28Transformers%29_6390.html" title="Huffer (Transformers)">Huffer</a>, with bringing in the powerful Dinobot, <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a>.

Sideswipe was seriously injured while trying to contain the situation, but managed at least to put out a distress call, alerting <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a> and Optimus Prime.</p>

He was freed by Prime, and later appeared battlng the <a href="../../../../articles/s/w/a/Swarm_%28Transformers%29_c0bc.html" title="Swarm (Transformers)">Swarm</a>. His fate is unknown.</p>

<p>Before the civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, Sideswipe was a merchant. After the war broke out he joined the Autobots. When <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobots splintered into smaller factions. Sideswipe stayed with the main Autobot force, now under the leadership of <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a>.</p>
<p>With the Autobots learned that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Sideswipe was part of a small investigation team led by Prowl. They discovered the mobile command base to be <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/y/Trypticon.html" title="Trypticon">Trypticon</a> and were forced to battle with little chance of success until the giant <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/c/Decepticon.html" title="Decepticon">Decepticon</a> was ordered to leave.</p>
<p>Some time after being reawakened on Earth four million years later, Sideswipe was aboard a ship named 'The Ark II' created by the Autobots and their human allies to end the war on Earth and return to Cybertron. However, the ship was sabotaged and exploded shortly after take-off. The human allies were killed, but Sideswipe and other Autobots were lost in the ocean. Sideswipe and the other lost Autobots were later found by Optimus Prime who used the Matrix to revive them. Sideswipe fought in the battle against the Decepticons in <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" class="mw-redirect" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, attacking <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a> with Sunstreaker.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> came to Earth claiming that the Earth-based Autobots were Cybertonian criminals; Optimus Prime surrendered and returned to Cybertron with half of his force. Sideswipe was amongst those ordered to stay behind, now under the command of <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>.</p>
<p>Sideswipe and the other Autobots who remained on Earth were attacked by <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Bruticus</a>. Sideswipe fell in this battle and was later repaired by the Earth Defense Command.</p>
<p>As part of a small group led by Jazz and <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marissa_Faireborn_d890.html" title="Marissa Faireborn">Marissa Faireborn</a> of the Earth Defense Command to search for missing soldiers and solve the mystery of the deserted city, Sideswipe found and battled the Insecticons along with his twin brother Sunstreaker. After defeating the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Insecticons</a>, the Autobots rejoined the other Autobots and were led by Prowl to the site of the future Autobot City: Earth.</p>

<p>In this reimagining of the Generation One story, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Sideswipe and Sunstreaker both turned into Cobra Stingers. <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/s/Destro.html" title="Destro">Destro</a> attempted to use them in a battle against G.I.

They were later seen fighting the Decepticons on Cobra Island.</p>
<p>Sideswipe reappeared in the third crossover series as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime.

However, all of them were transported away by <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>. Reformatted into a new body, he was forced to fight for Unicron's amusement (and unbeknownst to all, so that the Spark energy from fallen combatants could revitalize his own shattered frame), Sideswipe duelled his own brother. All were subsequently freed by the resurrected <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/t/Optimus_Primal_d343.html" title="Optimus Primal">Optimus Primal</a>, and Sideswipe went on to serve him as part of the new Autobot faction.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Generation 1 Deluxe Car Sideswipe</b> (1984)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Sideswipe's toy was originally part of a <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/k/Takara.html" title="Takara">Takara</a> toyline called <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/a/Diaclone.html" title="Diaclone">Diaclone</a> before <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> took some of the toys to use for Transformers. Sideswipe was one of the first Transformers to be released. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Because they were both Lamborghinis, Sideswipe and <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/n/Sunstreaker.html" title="Sunstreaker">Sunstreaker</a> were characterized as <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Fraternal_twins.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fraternal twins">fraternal twins</a>.</dd>
<dd>Oddly, the Tech Specs and TF: Universe profiles for Sideswipe describe the Sunstreaker toy. The rocket backpack describes Sunstreaker's engine, which is on his upper back in robot mode, and the shoulder mounted flares refer to the two yellow pods that mount on Sunstreaker's shoulders. The mix-up may have been due to the Diaclone toy decos. The toy used for Sideswipe had three Diaclone versions: red, yellow, and police, while the Sunstreaker mold was released only in red and police decos. This might also explain the red stickers behind Sunstreaker's rear wheels.</dd>
<dd>The mold used for the original Sideswipe also used for the first Generation 2 Sideswipe, and the Japanese-exclusive Autobots Tigertrack, Clampdown and Deep Cover. The Japanese variants are based on original variants used in the Diaclone line. The police car that became Clampdown was the basis for the fire escort Red Alert.</dd>

<p>Originally called Stepper in the Japanese series "Micron Legend", he was renamed Side Swipe (with a space) when Hasbro released the series in America. Transforming into a blue Nissan Skyline, Sideswipe's alternate mode is as realistic as an Armada toy can get to an actual vehicle. However, his robot mode is considered by many to be very poorly designed and is the subject of much ridicule.</p>
<p>Note: Early packaging of Side Swipe spelled his name without a space, but it was later added. According to online posts by Hasbro employees there was a mixup in the naming of Side Swipe and Mini-Con <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/g/Nightbeat_%28Transformers%29_69c0.html" title="Nightbeat (Transformers)">Nightbeat</a>, and the original intention was for them to have each other's name, making this toy a true homage to the original Nightbeat.</p>

<p>Side Swipe first appeared in the Armada episode "Past". In the animated series it was revealed that he had been saved from Decepticon execution by <a href="../../../../articles/b/l/u/Blurr.html" title="Blurr">Blurr</a>, and had travelled to Earth to join him. Instead, he ended up linking up with <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/t/Hot_Shot_%28Transformers%29_4912.html" title="Hot Shot (Transformers)">Hot Shot</a>. Initially unwilling to put up with him, Hot Shot soon had little choice when his former friend <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/e/Wheeljack.html" title="Wheeljack">Wheeljack</a> arrived and took Side Swipe prisoner. Hot Shot immediately raced to his rescue, starting a fire that threatened to consume all three. Hot Shot abandoned the fight to save Side Swipe, successfully getting him out in time. After this Side Swipe hero worshipped his new friend, much to Hot Shot's amusement, and served as his most loyal soldier when Hot Shot briefly took command of the Autobots after <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_%28Unicron_Trilogy%29_eb48.html" title="Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)">Optimus Prime</a>'s death.</p>

<p>Side Swipe also appeared in <a href="../../../../articles/d/r/e/Dreamwave_Productions_d154.html" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave</a>'s <i>Transformers: Armada</i> comic, with a much lesser role. He first appeared in issue #14.

Side Swipe survived relatively unscathed - unlike <a href="../../../../articles/b/l/u/Blurr.html" title="Blurr">Blurr</a> and Dropshot - and helped to eventually destroy the samurai Decepticon.</p>
<p>Side Swipe was last seen in issue #18 of the Armada series and did not make any appearances in the Transformers: Energon comic series.</p>
