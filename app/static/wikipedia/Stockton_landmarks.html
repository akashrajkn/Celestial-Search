<ul>
<li><b>Site of first building in present city of Stockton</b> (1844), Civic Court between Center and El Dorado streets. Thomas Lindsay build a tule hut on this site in 1844, shortly after the first settlers arrived at Rancho del Campo de los Franceses. Lindsay was later murdered by Indians and buried here by travelers. The site is currently home to City Hall, and is #178 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Burial place of John Brown</b> (1859), 1100 East Weber Street at North Union Street. John Brown, Stockton resident from 1851 to 1859, is notable for his four-day ride from Los Angeles to San Francisco to warn Commodore Stockton of the attack on Los Angeles. As a result of his actions, troops were sent to secure the city, and Brown - nicknamed Juan Flaco - became known as the 'Paul Revere of California.' He is buried in the former Citizen's Cemetery near this site, which is #513 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weber Point</b> (1850), 221 North Center Street. The point is the site of a two-story adobe-and-redwood house built in 1850 by Captain Charles Maria Weber, founder and pioneer developer of Stockton. One of the first elaborate residences and landscaped gardens in the San Joaquin Valley, it was Captain Weber's home until his death in 1881. Today the 9.7 acre site is home to the <a href="http://www.stocktongov.com/Parks/forrent/weberpoint.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.stocktongov.com/Parks/forrent/weberpoint.cfm" rel="nofollow">Weber Point Event Center</a>, which includes the Great Circle, Plaza, step Amphitheater, children's play area, an interactive water feature, Point Amphitheater, main stage, and waterfront promenade. The site was added to the city register by resolution number 30,304 on March 12, 1973, and is #165 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Temple Israel Cemetery</b> (1851), East Acacia Street between North Pilgrim and North Union streets. The cemetery site was donated to the Jewish community by Captain Charles Maria Weber in 1851. The site is currently the oldest Jewish cemetery in continuous use in California and west of the Rocky Mountains, and is #765 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>County Courthouse Site</b> (1853), 222 E Weber Avenue. Charles Weber donated the site to the city, despite his preference for the site of the old Franklin school, located at the confluence of Washington, Center, Lafayette, and Commerce streets. As the Hunter Square site was more centrally located, and was also the largest unbuilt area in the city, Weber agreed to donate the land, on condition that a central plaza be included in the plans. Hunter Square was created by filling in the slough on the west side of the block, and the first courthouse was constructed in 1853 (dedicated 1854). The current county courthouse sits on the site today. It was added to the city register by resolution number 30,102 on November 20, 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>County Jail Site</b> (1893), northeast corner of San Joaquin and Channel streets. Nicknamed "Cunningham's Castle," the fortress-like structure featured round masonry towers, turrets with conical roofs, short robust columns, contrasting stone colors, and rough-faced stonework. The Richardsonian Romanesque design was popular during the 1890s, and got its nickname from its medieval appearance as well as its construction during the term of Sheriff Thomas Cunningham. Construction began in 1891, but financial problems delayed completion until 1893. When it was finished, the three-story brick building was designed to hold 75 prisoners - eight cells in a semi-circle on the first two floors and six in the basement. Additional cells housed women and witnesses. With a continually growing population, however, the jail was soon operating beyond capacity; the jail averaged a population of over 400 inmates by the late 1940s. Deteriorating lime mortar and complaints of inhumane conditions led to the jail being abandoned in 1958 and torn down in 1961. In 1972, the City Council added the site to the city register by resolution number 30,101 on November 20, 1972.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Miner Levee Site</b> (1927), north side of Stockton Channel between Harrison and Lincoln streets. The site was added to the city register by resolution number 33,837 on January 31, 1977.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Temporary Detention Camps at the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds</b> (1942), Airport Way. With the outbreak of World War II and the tendency to detain Japanese-Americans "for their own safety," the Stockton Assembly Center housed 4,217 San Joaquin County residents from May 10 to October 17, 1942, under Executive Order 9066. The site is currently the Administration Building at the fairgrounds, and is #934 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Reuel Colt Gridley Monument</b>, Stockton Rural Cemetery near Memory Chapel, Cemetery Lane and East Pine Street. The memorial was erected by Rawlins Post of the Grand Army of the Republic and the citizens of Stockton in honor of Reuel Colt Gridley, who rendered services to Union soldiers during the War of the Rebellion when he collected $275,000 for the Sanitary Commission by selling and reselling a sack of flour. The memorial is #801 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/s/t/o/Stockton_landmarks.html" title="Edit section: Homes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homes</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Benjamin Holt Home</b> (1869). 548 E Park St. Benjamin Holt's home was constructed in 1869 by his father-in-law Benjamin Brown in the Greek Revival style. Square blocks, tall windows, high peaks, and a solid, square frame are hallmarks of the house, which was unusual in a time when most homes were built in the Gothic style. The lower floor contained many small rooms that would have been useful for entertaining or receiving guests; the main floor contained the kitchen, and the second floor housed a smaller kitchen and several small rooms connected to a long hallway. At the time of Holt's best-known invention, his home was fairly secluded and took up an entire city, his closest neighbors being a brewery and the asylum on North American Street. A New Hampshire native, Holt and his brothers had started a wagon spoke and wheel business, which they expanded to the west coast when they moved to Stockton in 1883. Their Stockton Wheel Company manufactured wooden and metal wheels, which mostly went into the construction of streetcars. In 1892, the company was renamed the Holt Manufacturing Company, moved to Aurora Street, and became one of the city's first large businesses to bring recognition to the city. The company produced the Combined Harvester, a piece of farming equipment similar to a tractor that was pulled by 26 mules and horses, and eventually sold it throughout the United States and the rest of the world. After November 1909, the company produced and sold a Caterpillar track-type tractor, the design later influencing the construction of armored tanks. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 29,100 on <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. The site is #82002254 on the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and was added on <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, and is presently home to the Martin Gipson Center of the San Joaquin County Health Care Services Agency’s Mental Health Division.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Swett-Moreing Home</b> (1883). 143 W Acacia St. The California Eastlake style (combination of Queen Anne and Eastlake) home was constructed for William Swett in 1883 by San Francisco architects Samuel and Joseph Newsom. Swett was a staff member at the Stockton Mail newspaper, and his family lived in the home until it was sold in 1891. Cyrus Moering Sr., a rancher and contractor, purchased the home 1898 and lived there until his death in 1911. Moering headed the firm of Cyrus Moreing &amp; Sons, which held many of the largest construction contracts for the bond highways in San Joaquin County. Moering was also an elected councilman for the Second Ward, and owned a baseball team. The home is significant because it is one of the oldest surviving examples of the Newsoms' work, and retains an essentially original appearance. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 39,263 on July 26, 1982.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Newell Home (1888)</b>. 1107 N San Joaquin St, in the Magnolia Historic Preservation District. This Queen Anne style home was built for Sidney Newell, a banker for Stockton Savings Bank as well as a steamboat company executive, and his wife Anna Elizabeth (Upslone). The Samuel and Joseph Newsom design features a hipped gable roof with a corbelled chimney on the south side (with a bargeboard, pendant, and vents), turned posts, delicate woodwork, and a stained glass window in the entry. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 29,170 on July 6, 1971.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Charles E. Owen Home</b> (1890). 1119 N San Joaquin St, in the Magnolia Historic Preservation District. The two-and-a-half story Queen Anne style home was constructed for Charles Owen next to the home of the man who conveyed him the deed. Built at a cost of $10,000, it was completed in February of 1890. It was sold in 1909 to William Brennan, owner of a leading livery stable. The home features a gabled roof with boxed eaves, lights, and shingles in the gables, bay windows with double-hung sashes, and wooden steps to the porch. It also has a hitching post in the front yard, one of the few left in Stockton. Owen was an accomplished musician, and had composed pieces that were published in San Francisco and Boston. The home is remarkable for its craftsmanship, as well as the quick construction timeline, remarkable for the 1890s. It was added to the city register by resolution number 34,629 on November 7, 1977.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr. Cross House</b> (1890). 207 W Acacia St. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 85-0597 on September 23, 1985, and today is a bed-and-breakfast known as the Old Victorian Inn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Moses Rodgers Home</b> (1890). 921 S San Joaquin St. The San Francisco-style home, with its bay window, tongue and groove siding, and wrap-around porch, was constructed for Missouri native - and African-American - Moses Rogers. Rogers was born a slave, but became a mining engineer and came to California for the Gold Rush in 1848. He quickly became known as an expert in the state, and investors went to him for advice regarding mining claims. Rogers moved his family to Stockton so that his five daughters would receive a good education, something that the schools were able to provide. The home is notable because of its architectural style, as well as the fact that it was owned by an African-American family. It is #78000763 on the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and was listed in 1978. It was added to the city register by resolution number 35,546 August 28, 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Edward B. Condy Home</b> (1893). 820 N Madison St. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 34,112 on May 9, 1977.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dunne Home (1895)</b>. 1335 N Hunter St. Built for Edward Dunne, a local shoe store owner, in 1895, this home's design combines elements of Eastlake, Stick, and Queen Anne styles. It features a collection of original stained glass windows. This home appears to have been enlarged, as the Dunne family grew, by attaching wings salvaged from other structures, which probably accounts for the home's extreme diversity of Victorian styles. This home is often referred to as Stockton's "Mystery House" and was added to the city register by resolution number 38,208 on May 11, 1981.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Superintendent's Home</b> (1900). Stockton State Hospital, 521 E Acacia St, in the Magnolia Historic Preservation District. <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> The home was added to the city register by resolution number 29,086 on June 1, 1971.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hurrle-Weston Home (1906)</b>. 5 E Harding Way. Once known as "The White Queen of Stockton," the home was added to the city register by resolution number 29,100 on June 7, 1971, and today houses the <a href="http://www.maxinesbridal.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.maxinesbridal.com/" rel="nofollow">Maxine's Bridal Shop</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Henery Apartments</b> (1913). 121 S Sutter St. This French Second Empire style brick and terra cotta building features a Mansard roof, arched windows, decorative surrounds, cornices with medallions, and decorative brackets. Designed by Glen Allen, whose firm is also known for Goold and John's Tudor Flats (1924) at 938-944 North Sutter Street, Stockton Memorial Civic Auditorium (1924), First Church of Christ Scientist (1928), and the Jewish Community Center (1928). The building was added to the city register by resolution number 86-0294 on May 19, 1986.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Wong K. Gew Mansion</b> (1921). 345 W Clay St. Designed by architect Peter Sala and constructed in a Classical Neo-Georgian style (1900-24) by Losekann &amp; Clowdsley, the home was one of the most costly in Stockton by the time it was completed in 1921. Gew had arrived in New York in 1900, and moved to Stockton in 1910, operating gambling establishments and acting as a partner in the construction of the Lincoln Hotel. At the time, city ordinance prohibited Chinese people from establishing homes north of Main Street, so Gew chose a large plot of land on Clay Street for his Southern-style home with twelve rooms (including two sleeping rooms for servants), a marble fireplace, Honduras mahogany, columns, classical windows, and a balcony. Gew is noted for breaking through several cultural and racial barriers, including hiring a Caucasian architect to design his home, as well as the fact that he was a well-respected Chinese businessman who had money, owned a car, and built an extravagant home outside of the area covered by the ordinance. The home is #78000761 on the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and was added on September 20, 1978. It was added to the city register by resolution number 30,834 on November 5, 1973.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Wong House (1924)</b>. 704 N Stockton St. The home was added to the city register by resolution number 38,553 on September 8, 1981.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cole's Five Cypress Farm</b>. 11221 E Eight Mile Rd. Constructed in Italianate and Greek Revival styles (1850-1924) by Joseph H. Cole, the home is #88000578 on the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and was added on <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.

<b>Stockton Developmental Center</b> (1853). 510 East Magnolia Street. Constructed as the Insane Asylum of California at Stockton in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>, the complex was situated on 100 acres of land donated by Captain Weber. The legislature at the time felt that existing hospitals were incapable of caring for the large numbers of people who suffered from mental and emotional conditions as a result of the <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Gold_Rush_e2d6.html" title="California Gold Rush">Gold Rush</a>, and authorized the creation of the first public mental health hospital in <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. The hospital is one of the oldest in the west, and was notable for its progressive forms of treatment. The hospital is #1016 on the Office of Historic Preservation's <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/California_Historical_Landmark_62f5.html" title="California Historical Landmark">California Historical Landmark</a> list, and today is home to California State University Stanislaus - Stockton Center.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Nippon Hospital</b> (<a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>), 25 South Commerce Street. Built in a Classical Revival style with gable crowns, colored brick, and classic Greek architecture, the two-story, 4864 square-foot structure was constructed in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> in response to the inadequate care that Japanese people received during an influenza outbreak the previous year. Named for the Japanese word for "Japan," the hospital featured 30 hospital rooms, a surgery suite, and an ethnic kitchen. Due to its central location within the Japanese area of <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/o/Stockton%2C_California_81d3.html" title="Stockton, California">Stockton</a>, as well as racial discrimination from Chinese and non-Asians elsewhere, the hospital catered exclusively to <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/o/Stockton%2C_California_81d3.html" title="Stockton, California">Stockton's</a> Japanese population of approximately 4,300 - one of the largest in the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.

The first Roman Catholic church in the San Joaquin Valley was constructed on two lots donated by Captain Charles Maria Weber on Washington and Hunter Streets. The location was ideal, due to its proximity to its primary population of Mexican, Spanish, Chilean, and French parishioners. The first church was a wooden structure, but the present brick Gothic design was dedicated in 1862. An additional to the north of the building was constructed in 1870, and the Gothic spire in 1893. Additional renovations were completed between 1945 and 1949. The adjacent parish is a two-story Classic Revival brick building constructed in 1905. The church used Washington Park, across the street, for religious festivities until it was replaced by the Crosstown Freeway in 1977. The building was added to the city register by resolution number 29,086 on June 1, 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></li>

<li><b>St. John's Episcopal Church</b> (1892). 115 East Miner Avenue, in the Magnolia Historic Preservation District. Built by members of the third-oldest Episcopal parish on the West Coast, this cruciform Norman-style church featured a piece of stained glass from the old church, which was placed over the west door and today is the oldest stained glass in San Joaquin Valley. In ensuing years, the church added memorial windows that were of Victorian (earth tones and pastels) and European styles (bold reds, greens, and blues. The parish unofficially started in 1850, but received its charter in 1858 as part of the Diocese of California. A brick building was constructed on land donated by Captain Charles Weber, and features a pipe organ from Boston, the pipes of which are still in use today. A Nordic-style Guild Hall was constructed in 1889, only to be replaced three years later by the current structure. The parish joined the new Missionary District of San Joaquin in 1911 after separating from the main diocese. In the 1950s, the vestry began purchasing several surrounding buildings for use in its ministries, including the former Chase Chevrolet facilities. The church was added to the city register by resolution number 29,100 on June 7, 1971, and is known today as the Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></li>

The hotel underwent an extensive renovation in 1950 at a cost of $200,000, but was the victim of poor timing. The increasing use of automobiles led to more convenient roadside motels with ample parking, and rising costs, led the hotel to close on November 26, 1960. For a number of years, the building was home to numerous county offices, including the Department of Public Assistance, due to the demolition of the old courthouse.

<li><b><a href="http://www.bobhopetheatre.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bobhopetheatre.com" rel="nofollow">Fox California Theatre</a></b> (1930), 242 E Main St. The first theatre on the site, the T &amp; D Photoplay, was constructed by the Wilhoit family and used for a variety of entertainment acts. In 1921, Fox West Coast Theaters leased and remodeled the building, renaming it the California; it was demolished in 1929 to make way for a more modern theatre. Fox signed a long-term lease (50 years), and spent nearly $500,000 on the Colonial Revival style (1925-49) cement and steel structure that was built by Beller Construction Co and Balch &amp; Stanberry. At the time, the theatre was the largest vaudeville house in California, with 2,170 seats and three ($40,000) manual Wurlitzer pipe organs with twin pipe lofts. The new theatre opened on October 14, 1930 with opening acts that included comedy skits as well as the latest "talkie" movies. The next 10 years featured movies as well as stage acts including Al Jolson, the Marx Brothers, Ted Lewis, and Henry Lauder, and the 1940s through the 1960s featured big bands such as Duke Ellington, Paul Whiteman, and the Dorseys. Westland Theatres bought the theatre in 1971, but closed in 1973 due to declining attendance. Amid concerns about demolishment, Edward C.
