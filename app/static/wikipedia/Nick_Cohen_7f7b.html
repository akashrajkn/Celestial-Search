<p><b>Nick Cohen</b> is a <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> journalist, author, and political commentator. He was educated at <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Hertford_College%2C_Oxford_ab4d.html" title="Hertford College, Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>, where he read <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philosophy%2C_Politics%2C_and_Economics_ce26.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Philosophy, Politics, and Economics">PPE</a>. He began his career at the <i>Birmingham Post and Mail</i> before becoming a reporter at <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>. He now writes a political column for <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Observer_f59d.html" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i>, a weekly column for the London <i><a href="../../../../articles/e/v/e/Evening_Standard_7d40.html" title="Evening Standard">Evening Standard</a></i>, and until June 2007 contributed regularly to the <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a></i>. Additionally, he writes occasional pieces for <i>Democratyia</i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Humanist_65b9.html" title="New Humanist">New Humanist</a></i>. Cohen has written three books; <i>Cruel Britannia: Reports on the Sinister and the Preposterous</i> (1999), a collection of his journalism, <i>Pretty Straight Guys</i> (2003), a highly critical account of the New Labour project, and <i>What's Left?</i> (2007), which he describes as the story of how the liberal left of the 20th century came to support the far right of the 21st. <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../../articles/o/r/w/Orwell_Prize_1a85.html" title="Orwell Prize">Orwell Prize</a> for political writing shortlisted <i>What's Left?</i> in 2008. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cohen argues he promotes left-wing democratic <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/c/Secular_humanism.html" title="Secular humanism">secular humanism</a>, and is regarded by some supporters as belonging to the intellectual tradition of radical writers such as <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/b/Albert_Camus_75c9.html" title="Albert Camus">Albert Camus</a>. Hitherto a strong critic of American foreign policy, he created controversy in 2002 when he announced his support for the invasion of Iraq and denounced the left for, as he saw it, failing to address <a href="../../../../articles/i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamist</a> ideology. "The left... has swerved to the right," he wrote.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> His critics have argued that he has in fact swerved to the right himself, and labeled him a <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>, pointing to his praise for Paul Wolfowitz and George W.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/i/c/Nick_Cohen_7f7b.html" title="Edit section: Domestic politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Domestic politics</span></h2>
<p>Though arguably best known for his views on foreign policy, Cohen also writes on domestic issues, including education policy, civil liberties, and inner-city racial tension. He has been a consistent opponent of the introduction of <a href="../../../../articles/i/d/e/Identity_cards.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Identity cards">identity cards</a>, has declared his support for <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/a/Grammar_schools.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Grammar schools">grammar schools</a>, and has attacked the increasing involvement of the private sector within public services.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, he was a critic of the former British <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> and the "New Labour" project, which he argued at that time was based on image, not principle. He told the British television network, Channel 4: "You get this picture of the leadership of this country, people in the heart of power, Blair, Campbell, Powell all in <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a>, all worried intensely and working intensely about the Prime Minister's image. This is the government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They really ought to have better things to do with their time ... Apart from Tony Blair's image, his sincerity, his integrity, there's no ideology behind it, beyond the standard <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/o/Neo-Conservative_3f09.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Neo-Conservative">neo-Conservative</a> ideology of the day, and so his integrity is kind of all they've got." <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cohen argues that he takes a broadly libertarian viewpoint on civil liberties issues. In particular, he has been a consistent opponent of the introduction of <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/i/British_national_identity_card.html" title="British national identity card">identity cards</a>, which he described in 2004 as a "counterproductive, authoritarian and ruinously expensive folly" <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>. He has also attacked the misuse of <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/b/Asbo.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Asbo">Anti-Social Behaviour Orders</a>, arguing that they "have created a new outlet for the small-minded and allowed them to treat people who would once have been dismissed as unlucky or unconventional or simple-minded as villains." <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, he appears to have a more less libertarian view of torture. In a 2006 article headlined 'We have to deport terrorist suspects whatever their fate', he criticizes the British government for its reluctance to deport terror suspects to states that are known to commit torture, saying they should prioritize "national interests." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1939959,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1939959,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>He has also written frequently on the topic of inner-city racial tension, arguing that British liberals have discouraged racial integration. In the aftermath of the <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/z/Lozells_Riot_256f.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Lozells Riot">Birmingham riots</a> in October 2005, he recalled his time as a reporter for the <i>Birmingham Post &amp; Mail</i> during the <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/n/Handsworth_riots.html" title="Handsworth riots">Handsworth riots</a> twenty years earlier, and drew pessimistic conclusions from events in the interim period, writing: "I can see no more urgent task than taking the fight to those on the right and the left who are busily piling bricks on ghetto walls. If they're not stopped, I don't like to think what Handsworth or the rest of the country will be like in 20 years." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>. He has written on the relative success of the <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> at the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_Kingdom_local_elections%2C_2006_df93.html" title="United Kingdom local elections, 2006">2006 local elections</a>, arguing that, "if polite society stuffs British citizens into hermetically sealed boxes and labels them as the blacks or the Muslims, it is not so strange that people should decide to be the whites and vote accordingly." <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On economic issues, Cohen argued against increasing economic inequality for most of his career, something which he argues has been exacerbated by the disappearance of grammar schools. There is, however, some evidence that his views have shifted. In January 2007 in the Evening Standard he <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20070117/ai_n17131966" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20070117/ai_n17131966" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that couples earning 100,000 GBP a year (the richest 2 percent) were finding it difficult to survive financially in London due to the pressures of school fees, house prices and council tax, and unless the governing Labour Party addressed their concerns it would lose the next general election. He has subsequently praised the Conservatives' tax proposals, particularly their policy to raise the level at which <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/h/Inheritance_tax.html" title="Inheritance tax">inheritance tax</a> is levied from £350,000 to £1m. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cohen currently has no declared party political allegiance; he has said that he has never been a member of any political party other than the <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>. He initially suggested, however, that he would vote <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> to defeat <a href="../../../../articles/k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> in the London mayoral elections, on the grounds that Livingstone had shaken hands with <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/g/Hugo_Chavez_1fdf.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hugo Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a> who has in turn shaken hands with <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/b/Robert_Mugabe_10bb.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>. In the end, he voted for Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick, while directing his criticisms entirely at Livingstone.</p>
<p>Cohen has praised the Conservative Party for, as he put it, having fairer and more progressive tax proposals than their opponents on the left. The headline to this article, reproduced on Cohen's own website, said he was "turning... into a Tory."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> He also suggests in his book 'What's Left' that the prioritisation of single mothers for council housing "provides a perverse incentive for single motherhood" and says that "the liberal professionals of the welfare state were aggravating the poverty and racism they said they opposed".</p>

<p>Before the lead-up to the Iraq war in 2002, Cohen had been a fierce critic of UK and U.S. foreign policy. These criticisms continued for some months after the attacks of September 11, 2001; he opposed that year's <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/War_in_Afghanistan_%282001%E2%80%93present%29_53f3.html" title="War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">Afghanistan war</a> and, in November 2001, argued that Tony Blair had "pinned a large target sign on this country" in his alliance with the U.S. in the <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">war on terror</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>. In January 2002 he declared in the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a> that the US's "unilateral" foreign policy meant it was <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/200201140006" class="external text" title="http://www.newstatesman.com/200201140006" rel="nofollow">"right to be Anti-American"</a>. In March of that year he argued that Tony Blair was keen on what he called a <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,673014,00.html" class="external text" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,673014,00.html" rel="nofollow">"needless war"</a> in Iraq and other pro-Bush policies because Britain still owed the US money from World War II. He argued that "The Prime Minister gives every appearance of being willing to risk the lives of British troops in a war he believed should not be fought".</p>
<p>Later in 2002 and through 2003, Cohen had a change of heart. After the large-scale February 2003 <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2003_Iraq_War_53c2.html" class="mw-redirect" title="2003 Iraq War">anti-war</a> demonstration in <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, he was particularly critical of those human-rights, <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminist</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>-rights activists who marched alongside Islamist groups, whom he accused of <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a>. Cohen criticized the <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/o/Stop_the_War_Coalition_2b62.html" title="Stop the War Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a> over its attitude toward Iraqi dissenters: "Iraq is the only country in the Arab world with a strong, democratic movement. Yet I wonder how many who marched yesterday know of the dissenters' existence. The demonstration's organisers have gone to great lengths to censor and silence ... The <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a>, which dominates the alliance, was happy to cohost the march with the reactionary <a href="../../../../articles/m/u/s/Muslim_Association_of_Britain_bb04.html" title="Muslim Association of Britain">British Association of Muslims</a>. The association had blotted its copybook by circulating a newspaper which explained that apostasy from Islam is 'an offence punishable by death'. But what the hell. In the interests of multi-culturalism, the SWP ignored the protests of squeamish lefties and let that pass. The Trots aren't Islamophobes, after all. The only Muslims they have a phobia about are secular Iraqi Muslims who, shockingly, believe in human rights." <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>He has been particularly critical of <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Galloway_f81f.html" title="George Galloway">George Galloway</a>, the <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/s/RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition_505f.html" class="mw-redirect" title="RESPECT The Unity Coalition">Respect</a> MP, whom he has likened to <a href="../../../../articles/o/s/w/Oswald_Mosley_abcc.html" title="Oswald Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, and the Respect coalition more generally, which is linked to the Stop the War Coalition and the Socialist Workers Party. He has also criticized <a href="../../../../articles/k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>, the London mayor, for his association with Islamist clerics such as <a href="../../../../articles/y/u/s/Yusuf_al-Qaradawi_80a1.html" title="Yusuf al-Qaradawi">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a>. For Cohen, the "principled left" is a thing of the past.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The hit of the season is <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>'s <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>, a sort of <i><a href="../../../../articles/f/o/x/Fox_News_e423.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fox News">Fox News</a></i> for liberals. Among the many clunking contradictions and honking errors, one unforgivable scene stands out. Moore brushes aside the millions forced into exile and mass graves by Saddam Hussein, and decides to present life in one of the worst tyrannies of the late 20th century as sweet and simple. Boys scamper to barber shops. Merry children fly kites. Blushing lovers get married. At the end of the film, leftish audiences in <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="United States of America">America</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> show they are more than prepared to forgive and forget.

<p>In his switch to support for the wider <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">war on terror</a>, Cohen cited <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/u/Paul_Berman_0d98.html" title="Paul Berman">Paul Berman</a>'s book <i>Terror and Liberalism</i> as a major influence: "The only time I realised I was charging up a blind alley was when I read Paul Berman's <i>Terror and Liberalism</i>. I didn't see a blinding light or hear a thunder clap or cry 'Eureka!' If I was going to cry anything it would have been 'Oh bloody hell!' ... I was going to have to turn it round and see the world afresh." <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of Cohen's position on Iraq have pointed to his support of the <a href="../../../../articles/i/r/a/Iraqi_National_Congress_1d79.html" title="Iraqi National Congress">Iraqi National Congress</a> in the run-up to war, and his praise for its leader <a href="../../../../articles/a/h/m/Ahmed_Chalabi_f6aa.html" title="Ahmed Chalabi">Ahmed Chalabi</a>, the alleged conduit for much of the faulty pre-war intelligence. As the possibility of war with Iraq emerged in early 2002, Cohen promoted the INC as 'an inspiring resistance group' and criticised its 'shunning... by right-thinking, Left-leaning people', as well as by the <a href="../../../../articles/c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="CIA">CIA</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/State_Department_dd31.html" class="mw-redirect" title="State Department">State Department</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many in the INC believe that what truly infuriates the CIA is that Chalabi is a cultured businessman, who speaks English better than most Western politicians. He argues with style and force against the INC’s detractors on the US networks and in Congress and the Washington think-tanks. George Tenet, who, incredibly, remains the CIA director after his failure to protect his country on 11 September, is the leader of the faction in Washington which loathes the INC… In Washington, the State Department, which has stopped funding the INC after disputed accusations of fraud, and the CIA take no notice of the threat and support the ‘nicer Sunni tyrant’ option. Paradoxically, the greatest supporters of the civilian movement are the military in the Pentagon. The struggle between the departments is underway, but the balance of forces is against the INC. A democratic Iraq would give the subject peoples of the Gulf monarchies ideas above their station. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Cohen repeated his praise of the INC in a number of columns leading up to the war, describing it as a 'a loose and fractious coalition, but one which, for all its faults, is committed to democracy.' <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>. Even before revelations of the role played by Chalabi and the INC in providing dubious intelligence, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Mark_Seddon_1ce8.html" title="Mark Seddon">Mark Seddon</a> argued that "Cohen's faith in the shambolic Iraqi National Congress, presided over by a convicted fraudster, Ahmad Chalabi, is horribly misplaced." <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics also point to his attitude to <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, which has evolved concurrently with his views on foreign policy. He wrote in January 2005: "In the long-run the only solution is for the global move towards democracy to get moving again. In these strange times, the only person who believes that this is possible or desirable is George W. Bush. In his inauguration address last week he announced that the 'survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.' And was feared and hated by right-thinking people the world over for saying so." <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> After meeting <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/u/Paul_Wolfowitz_f15f.html" title="Paul Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a> in London, Cohen wrote: “I was clearly in the presence of real power...I was in the presence of a politician committed to extending human freedom.” <a href="http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=1161" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=1161" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>He has also been criticised by the left-wing journalist <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Monbiot_d1d1.html" title="George Monbiot">George Monbiot</a> for failing, as he saw it, to seriously condemn human rights abuses committed by the American and British governments in Iraq. <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/iraq-monbiot151105.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.countercurrents.org/iraq-monbiot151105.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> He wrote that Cohen and other liberal hawks "accused those who opposed the war of caring nothing for the welfare of the Iraqis. Given that they care so much, why has none of these hawks spoken out against the use of unconventional weapons by coalition forces?" He later noted that Cohen wrote in 2002, "Former lefties can make a good living in the media by attacking their ex-comrades - I'd do it myself if the price was right." <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/200208120009" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newstatesman.com/200208120009" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>In response to criticism of the Iraq on the invasion of Iraq, Cohen has argued, "If you say it is illegal to overthrow a genocidal tyrant, then you have to say that genocide is legal."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cohen has claimed he is the victim of <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, particularly after writing about the relationship between the left and the far right. After one such column, he wrote: "I couldn’t believe the anti-Semitism that hit me." <sup id="cite_ref-antisemitism_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-antisemitism-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Although readers may have assumed he was <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> because of his surname, he has written that, in fact, "there hasn’t been a Jewish member of [his] family for 100 years". <sup id="cite_ref-antisemitism_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-antisemitism-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2007 the journalist <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/Johann_Hari_63ab.html" title="Johann Hari">Johann Hari</a> reviewed Cohen's book <i>What's Left</i> in the American <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/i/s/Dissent_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dissent (magazine)">Dissent</a></i> magazine, where he called for Cohen and others (like Hari himself) who supported the Iraq war from a left-wing perspective to admit they had been wrong and had profoundly misunderstood neoconservatism.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup>. Cohen argued that Hari's review was "deceitful", a "fairytale", "Maoist" and "a nervous breakdown in print", focusing in particular on Hari's claim that Cohen's parents had raised him to see <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> as a moral archetype, which he denied.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup>. Hari called this response "bizarre" and offered quotes from Cohen which he argued backed up his claims, accusing Cohen of "a baffling denial of his own words".<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
