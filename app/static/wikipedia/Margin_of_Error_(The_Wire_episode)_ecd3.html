<p>The title refers to the mayoral primary and the percentages taken in the poll. In statistical analysis, the <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Margin_of_error.html" title="Margin of error">margin of error</a> expresses the amount of the random variation underlying a survey's results. This can be thought of as a measure of the variation one would see in reported percentages if the same poll were taken multiple times. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one has that the poll's reported percentages are close to the "true" percentages, that is the percentages in the whole <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/p/Population.html" title="Population">population</a>.</p>

<p>Churchgoers gather for services two days before the mayoral primary election. All three candidates (Incumbent Mayor <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/a/Clarence_Royce_1bf7.html" title="Clarence Royce">Clarence Royce</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Anthony_Gray" title="List of characters from The Wire">Councilman Anthony Gray</a> and Councilman <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/m/Tommy_Carcetti_b001.html" title="Tommy Carcetti">Tommy Carcetti</a>) are in attendance at separate churches with their families. As <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Randy_Wagstaff" title="List of characters from The Wire">Randy Wagstaff</a> arrives at another church with his foster mother, Miss Anna, he is watched by <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/d/Bodie_Brodus_0798.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Bodie Brodus">Bodie Brodus</a> and his crew of drug dealers including Little Kevin. Inside Reverend Franklin's church, other revelers enjoying the gospel music include Carcetti's deputy campaign manager <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Norman_Wilson_9fe5.html" title="Norman Wilson">Norman Wilson</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Odell_Watkins" title="Politicians of The Wire">State Delegate Odell Watkins</a>, middle school teacher <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/h/School_system_of_The_Wire_7762.html#Grace_Sampson" title="School system of The Wire">Grace Sampson</a> and Carcetti staffer <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Gerry" title="Politicians of The Wire">Gerry</a>.</p>
<p>Reverend Franklin offers a sermon from Exodus about the careful selection of leaders from the people. He urges the people to look for men of truth, who fear God and hate covetousness, to be their leaders. After his ceremony, Royce greets the churchgoers. On his way out Tommy talks to the preacher with his wife, <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Jen_Carcetti" title="Politicians of The Wire">Jen Carcetti</a>. He tells the preacher that Moses is a high standard to hold him to and even blasphemes in front of the preacher. The preacher is jovial and wishes him luck after noticing that Watkins is handing out fliers for him.</p>
<p>Carcetti campaigns in the downtown area with Wilson. He is greeted by a Baltimore county science teacher who agrees with his policies but is not eligible to vote in the election. Watkins comes over to show Carcetti a flier he has found. It claims that Carcetti once defended a notorious “slum lord” named Bobby Harrison from prosecution over his poor treatment of his tenants. Harrison is hated throughout Baltimore and the flier even has a photograph of the two together on the courthouse steps. Wilson recognizes the flier as a last-minute smear attempt. Carcetti realizes that the photo is a fake and becomes pessimistic about his chances of winning in the face of these tactics. Gerry and Wilson immediately formulate plans to respond to the flier.</p>
<p>Carcetti meets with his campaign staff, including campaign manager <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Politicians_of_The_Wire_cca7.html#Theresa_D.27Agostino" title="Politicians of The Wire">Theresa D'Agostino</a>, to discuss their response to the flier. D’Agostino has a printer on retainer and plans to produce counter literature. Wilson offers to use his journalistic contacts to prove that the photo is a fake. Carcetti remains agitated and his staff urge him to carry on with his schedule while they deal with the problem.</p>
<p>Later Tommy and Jen watch coverage of the controversial flier. The news reports that Carcetti and Royce are in a dead heat while Gray trails. Jen asks about the smear flier and Tommy tells her about his staff’s positive response. In the morning Wilson arrives to pick Tommy up, but finds he has already left for the office. Wilson finds Tommy second-guessing their strategy and advises him to follow the advice of the staff he has hired and appear on the morning talk shows.</p>
<p>Carcetti returns to the campaign headquarters feeling more positive after his successful radio appearances. He is still concerned about the smear campaign. Wilson has news that State Senator <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/a/Clay_Davis_4c47.html" title="Clay Davis">Clay Davis</a> is interested in supporting Carcetti, but as usual he is more interested in how much money he can make out of it. Carcetti is dubious about working with Davis, but Wilson convinces him that it may tip the balance.</p>
<p>Carcetti and Wilson meet Davis in a restaurant and he offers to split his support between them and the mayor for twenty thousand dollars. He writes his fee on a napkin while discussing what he will do. Carcetti and Wilson agree to pay him but leave without eating.</p>

De’Londa hopes that Brianna may have work for Namond.</p>
<p>Brianna has actually called the meeting to tell De’Londa that she is cutting them off. Brianna feels that she has amply compensated them for Wee-Bey’s support, and with the collapse of the Barksdale organization, there is no longer any income. She no longer wants to protect her imprisoned brother <a href="../../../../articles/a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon</a> because she believes he had a hand in the death of her own son, <a href="../../../../articles/d/%E2%80%99/a/D%E2%80%99Angelo_Barksdale_a27c.html" class="mw-redirect" title="D’Angelo Barksdale">D’Angelo</a>, so she has nothing more to fear from Wee-Bey because he cannot tie her to any drug trafficking. Brianna tells Namond that she wanted them both to be there so that De’Londa could not lie to him about what happened.</p>
<p>At home De’Londa tells Namond he is going to start dealing for himself. She still refuses to let him drop out of school. She insists that she will convince Bodie to give him a package. Namond asks about what Brianna meant about them already having enough money and De’Londa tells him that Brianna was lying. De’Londa phones a disinterested Wee-Bey to tell him what has happened, comparing the situation to coming home to find they had been evicted.</p>

Stanfield takes a phone call about picking up a “skinny girl from New York” and then insists on doing it himself.</p>
<p>Herc rewatches the video with Sydnor and a lip reader. She correctly follows the discussion and Herc interprets that Stanfield is picking up cocaine from New York. Sydnor is surprised that Stanfield would go near a package of narcotics himself and Herc remains insistent that Stanfield is a soft target.</p>
<p>Herc follows Stanfield to <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Station_%28Baltimore%29_d3ed.html" title="Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)">Penn Station</a>. He has the transport police pick up Stanfield when he meets with a woman and carries her bag. The woman resists Marlo’s attempts to help her and is shocked when the police stop them.

<p>Namond walks down the corridor with Monell and Paul, two boys who recently had a tryst in a boy's bathroom with a classmate named Tiff while Randy stood watch outside. When they pass Tiff in the corridor they ignore and then insult her.</p>
<p>Grace Sampson meets with the teaching staff to tell them of a new program within the school. Funds from the University of Maryland are being used to set up a class for kids with behavioural difficulties. Ten children will be in the first class but more may follow if the program is deemed successful. Mrs Shapiro is pleased while Mrs Scott is disappointed that only three of her worst students will be taken.</p>

<p>Paul, Monell and Randy are also pulled out of class by Donnelly. Donnelly interrogates Randy about his role in what Tiff has characterised as a rape. Donnelly knows that he was a lookout and is forced to suspend him. She rings his foster mother Anna Jeffries but hangs up when Randy tells her that he knows about a murder. Later, Prez appeals to Donnelly to let him hand Randy’s confession on to someone that he trusts within the police department.</p>

Albert realizes that the class means that they will be separated from the other children giving them more space to learn. Sampson tells them that the new program will ready them for a normal classroom as they have proven that they are not ready at the moment. Namond draws an analogy of prison for the new class with their class being solitary confinement and the normal classes being the general population. Colvin jumps on the comment and uses it to intimidate the children.</p>

He passes campaign posters and leaflet delivery men running to the <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/r/Curtis_Mayfield_a0ca.html" title="Curtis Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a> tune. Norris and Greggs bemoan their assignment to a polling station.</p>
<p>Gray is the first of the candidates to vote. Carcetti votes and then moves on to <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/g/Highlandtown%2C_Baltimore_91de.html" title="Highlandtown, Baltimore">Highlandtown</a> where Wilson thinks they can flush out his base. Carcetti passes out leaflets and flirts with a female supporter. An Italian-American man greets him and tells Carcetti that it is their turn to take over from the African Americans, saying that white politicians will still be corrupt, but less so than the blacks. This man also derogatorily refers to <a href="../../../../articles/a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" class="mw-redirect" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> as <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/o/Moolie.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Moolie">Moolies</a> in front of Carcetti and Wilson.

<p>Back at headquarters, Carcetti sees Davis on live television offering his full support to Royce. He is shocked that Davis has brazenly failed to deliver on his promise after taking their money.</p>
<p>Miss Anna and Randy arrive at the polling station, and she is worried that the queue will make her late for work. Randy recognizes Spider from Cutty’s gym giving out leaflets. He asks to stay with him while she votes and she reluctantly allows him. Cutty also recognizes Spider and tries to talk to him as he has not been at the gym. Spider runs away and Randy is left to talk to Cutty who asks him to get Spider to come and see him at the gym. Randy is given a stack of leaflets to pass out by a Carcetti campaign staffer who has noticed Spider’s absence. Later, Randy gets a box of leaflets to put in doors. The staffer pays him up front.

<p>De’Londa finds Namond playing video games and asks him why he is not in school. Namond explains that the election means that school is closed. De’Londa seizes the opportunity to take Namond to see Bodie. Bodie is initially unsure but De’Londa refuses to take no for an answer and uses Wee-Bey’s name to convince Bodie. De’Londa tells Namond to make her proud. After De’Londa leaves Bodie tells Namond that she is a "dragon lady" and tells Namond that talking to her gives him insight into his personality.</p>
<p>Michael goes to Cutty’s gym, where Cutty is already flirting with another woman. Namond arrives and asks Michael for help moving his first package and Michael refuses. Cutty talks to Michael about the woman and then asks about Spider. Michael explains that Spider quit because of Cutty getting involved with his mother. Namond returns home at the end of the day and is faced with his mother telling him that she is counting on him.</p>
<p>At home that evening, Jen and Tommy ignore constantly ringing phones. The news reports that there was a massive voter turnout and that Carcetti is in the lead. Similar scenes unfold at Royce and Gray’s homes. Tommy learns that Bond is beating Demper in the State’s Attorney race. This is good news for Tommy, as it shows a lack of support for Royce’s ticket. Jen convinces Tommy to go for a walk with her. They make their way around the harbor and Tommy tells Jen that he hopes to make Baltimore great again. She is positive about his chances. He gets a call from D’Agostino to tell him that Royce has conceded, making him the presumptive mayor-elect -- because Baltimore is such a heavily Democratic city, the winner of the Democratic primary is all but assured a win in the general election against whomever the Republican Party might field. Tommy is unsure whether he is happy about the win but finally breaks into a smile. They make their way to a celebration and Tommy thanks his supporters and his opponents, appealing for their help in the forthcoming general election and in improving Baltimore for his children. Council President Naresse Campbell congratulates Carcetti. Jen tells him that she is going home and to enjoy his night. Davis also attends the party and is unashamed of his actions, telling Carcetti he let him off lightly.</p>
<p>The party continues with Gerry, Wilson, Tommy, and D’Agostino in a downtown hotel. Gerry leaves with Wilson. D’Agostino comes on to Carcetti, telling him that he owes her a win bonus. He resists her overtures despite his initial response. D’Agostino tries to convince him that he cannot go against his nature but eventually backs down when he resists a second time.</p>
