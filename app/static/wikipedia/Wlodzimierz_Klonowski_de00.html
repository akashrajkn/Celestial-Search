</div>
<p><b>Włodzimierz Klonowski</b> is a leading biomedical <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/y/Physicist.html" title="Physicist">physicist</a> who has also made important interdisciplinary contributions.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Klonowski was born in Moscow where his parents put up at the end of the II World War on they way back from Bashkirian village in Ural mountains where Soviets had displaced them after invading Poland in September 1939. He was born on the Stary (Old) Arbat Street where the name stone in his honour has been put close to the fountain (the former Grauerman maternity hospital has now official address 7 New Arbat). His father, Stefan Klonowski, was a specialist in Polish studies. His mother, Gabriela Pauszer-Klonowska was a novelist. Klonowski has been living in <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> since 1946 until martial law was introduced in Poland in 1981. He obtained his M.Sc. in <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">Physics</a> from the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/University_of_Warsaw_314a.html" title="University of Warsaw">University of Warsaw</a> in famous 1968 with specializations in <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/o/Biophysics.html" title="Biophysics">Biophysics</a>. Then he has worked for several years at the Institute of Basic Technological Research <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences_2d22.html" title="Polish Academy of Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> on theory of networks and of sol-gel transitions in macromolecular systems. He got his Ph.D. in Physics from the Institute of Physics <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences_2d22.html" title="Polish Academy of Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> in 1973. Then he has worked on theory of <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Intracranial_pressure.html" title="Intracranial pressure">intracranial pressure</a> at the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical Research Center <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences_2d22.html" title="Polish Academy of Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a>. From there he left with his family to become professor in Physics and in Biophysics at the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/University_of_Kinshasa_2af0.html" title="University of Kinshasa">University of Kinshasa</a>, Kongo (then Zaïre, French-speaking), where he was caught by the martial law in Poland. He has been a fellow in <a href="http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/english/start/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/english/start/index.php" rel="nofollow">Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry</a> in Goettingen, Germany (1982-1984) and then with German Fremdenpass, because Polish People Republic refused to give him a valid passport, he moved as a visiting professor to Brandeis Univerity, Waltham, MA, USA (1984-1986). In 1986 he decided to emigrate officially to Canada where he has worked at <a href="../../../../articles/m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University</a>, Hamilton, ON, and then moved to Halifax, NS, where he established a small computer consulting and tutoring firm. While working in Goettingen Klonowski has written his habilitation thesis on the theory formation of supramolecular structures in (bio)polymer systems and submitted it to <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/m/Humboldt_University_d033.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Humboldt University">Humboldt University</a>, Berlin (then <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/German_Democratic_Republic_b577.html" class="mw-redirect" title="German Democratic Republic">DDR</a>), since it was recognized in the West as being German and in the East as being socialistic. Only in1990 after obtaining his Canadian citizenship he could go to Berlin for the colloquium. After reunification of Germany his Dr.sc.nat. degree in Theoretical Biophysics was officially declared by a special lustrating commission of the new Scientific Council to be equivalent to German habilitation, and then it was recognized in Poland in 1994. Klonowski returned to Poland at the end of 1994 and in 1995 he joined the <a href="http://www.ibib.waw.pl/pindex.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ibib.waw.pl/pindex.php" rel="nofollow">Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering</a> <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences_2d22.html" title="Polish Academy of Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> where he is currently the Head of the Lab. of Biosignal Analysis Fundamentals.<br />
<br />
His scientific work has always had an interdisciplinary character. His monograph Probabilistic Theory of Crosslinked Macromolecular Systems with Applications in <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/e/Chemical_Physics_ea78.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Chemical Physics">Chemical Physics</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/o/Biophysics.html" title="Biophysics">Biophysics</a> (Books on Demand, University Microfilms International, Ann Arbor and London, 1984) is still to be purchased through Internet book stores e.g. AbeBooks.de and is assessed to be ‘Bewertung’. A molecular informational structure was named after him - Klonowski-Klonowska conformon (term proposed by S.Ji in the book ‘Molecular Theories of Cell Life and Death’, S.Ji, ed. Rutgers Univ. Press, 1991). His scientific interests extend from <a href="../../../../articles/s/y/s/System_biology.html" class="mw-redirect" title="System biology">system biology</a> (The Metaphor of 'Chaos', in: Systems Biology: Principles, Methods, and Concepts, A. K. Konopka, Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2006), through <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/u/Neuropsychology.html" title="Neuropsychology">neuropsychology</a> to <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> of <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Complexity.html" title="Complexity">complexity</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Consciousness.html" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>. Himself he served as the editor of series Frontiers of <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/n/Nonlinear_Dynamics_6e43.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Nonlinear Dynamics">Nonlinear Dynamics</a> (Past Science Publisher, Lengerich, Berlin: Attractors, Signals, and Synergetics (2002); From Quanta to Societies (2003), Simplicity behind Complexity (2004)). He has also been actively involved in popularization of science – the edition of 19.500 copies of his book Tajemnice Biofizyki (Mysteries of Biophysics), Warsaw, 1981, had been sold out in a few months. He has also written features for newspapers, in Poland and in Canada, and he even was a candidate to the <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> for the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Canada_88c7.html" title="Green Party of Canada">Green Party of Canada</a>. in 1992. Currently he is an Expert of the Polish Chamber of Ecology. For cooperation with Medical Doctors he obtained in 2000 Honorary 50. Anniversary Medal conferred by the Rector of the <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/d/Medical_University_of_Warsaw_60dc.html" title="Medical University of Warsaw">Medical University of Warsaw</a> and in 2004 he was awarded <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/l/Golden_Cross_of_Merit_7fb7.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Golden Cross of Merit">Golden Cross of Merit</a> conferred by the President of the Republic of Poland.<br />
Klonowski is actively involved in international scientific cooperation. He has been the founder and the coordinator of the European Interdisciplinary Schools on Nonlinear Dynamics for System and Signal Analysis EUROATTRACTOR (<a href="../../../../articles/f/i/f/Fifth_European_Community_Framework_Programme_fbfb.html" title="Fifth European Community Framework Programme">Framework Programme 5.</a> of the European Community, 2000-2002). In <a href="../../../../articles/s/i/x/Sixth_Framework_Programme_71a9.html" title="Sixth Framework Programme">FP 6.</a> he has been sitting on Physics panels as an Individual Expert for Marie Curie and NEST Actions of the European Community and serves as the Leader of the <a href="http://www.gbaf.eu" class="external text" title="http://www.gbaf.eu" rel="nofollow">Group of Biosignal Analysis Fundamentals</a> (GBAF, <a href="http://www.cmdik.pan.pl/index_eng.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cmdik.pan.pl/index_eng.html" rel="nofollow">Medical Research Center Polish Academy of Sciences</a>) in <a href="http://www.sensation-eu.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.sensation-eu.org/" rel="nofollow">IST Integrated Project SENSATION</a> (2004-2007). He also represents Poland on the Management Committees of three <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/s/COST_ab9e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="COST">COST</a> Actions – ENOC (where he also serves as the Chair of the Theoretical Working Group), NEUROMATH, and BM0605.<br />
<br />
He has been very active in scientific societies.
