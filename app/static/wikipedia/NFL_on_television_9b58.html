	    <p>The <b>television rights to broadcast <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> (NFL) games</b> are the most lucrative and expensive rights of any sport. It was television that brought professional <a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> into prominence in the modern era of technology. Since then, NFL broadcasts have become among the most-watched programs on American television, and the fortunes of entire networks have rested on owning NFL broadcasting rights.</p>
<p>Currently, five American <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/l/Television_networks.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Television networks">television networks</a> (<a href="../../../../articles/c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>) are paying a combined total of <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US $</a> 21.4 billion, <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US $</a> 3.735 billion / per year (2006) to broadcast NFL games. However, the league imposes several strict television policies to ensure that stadiums are filled and sold out, to maximize TV ratings, and to help leverage content on these networks. Also, <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a> broadcast 7 games per season.</p>
<p>NFL preseason telecasts are more in line with the other major sports leagues' regular season telecasts, in that there are more locally-produced telecasts. Some games will air nationally, however.</p>

<p>The TV rights to the NFL are the most lucrative and expensive rights not only of any American sport, but of any American entertainment property. With the fragmentation of audiences due to the increased specialization of broadcast and cable TV networks, sports remain one of the few entertainment properties that not only can guarantee a large and diversified audience, but an audience that will watch in real time.</p>
<p>Annually, the Super Bowl often ranks among the most watched shows of the year. Four of <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/e/Nielsen_Media_Research_0eee.html" title="Nielsen Media Research">Nielsen Media Research</a>'s top 10 programs are Super Bowls <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Networks have purchased a share of the broadcasting rights to the NFL as a means of raising the entire network's profile. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Under the current television contracts, which began during the 2006 season, regular season games are broadcast on five networks: <a href="../../../../articles/c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, and The <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a>. In 2006, CBS announced it would air only three games per week in high-definition. The move created some outrage and animosity towards CBS, along with accusations of the network being "cheap." <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> FOX, NBC, and ESPN air all of their games in high-definition. <i>See main article</i>: <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_CBS_HDTV_Controversy_d324.html" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL on CBS HDTV Controversy">NFL on CBS HDTV Controversy</a></p>
<p><a name="Regional_games" id="Regional_games"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Regional games">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Regional games</span></h3>
<p>With these current contracts, the regional Sunday afternoon games are broadcast on CBS and FOX. CBS has broadcast rights to all regional AFC intra-conference games, and FOX has all rights to regional NFC intra-conference games. Inter-conference games are broadcast by the network that is the normal broadcast partner for the <i>away</i> team's conference. In 1970, when the NFL and AFL merged, and home blackouts were put into place for AFC games (the AFL had lifted these during its run), this assured that all Sunday road games would be seen on the same network, while allowing both networks access to every stadium in the league. Three games (with some exceptions, see below) are broadcast in any one market each Sunday afternoon, with one network getting a "double-header" each week (the 1:00 p.m. <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone_d793.html" class="mw-redirect" title="North American Eastern Time Zone">ET</a>/10:00 a.m. <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/c/Pacific_Time_Zone_fd43.html" title="Pacific Time Zone">PT</a> and 4:15 p.m. ET/1:15 p.m. PT games) while the other network broadcasting <i>either</i> a 1:00 p.m. ET or a 4:05 p.m. ET game.</p>
<p>During the first sixteen weeks of the schedule, both FOX and CBS are given eight double-headers apiece. The two networks alternate double-headers, but not necessarily week-in and week-out. For example, in early October, CBS typically airs two or three consecutive double-header weekends, while FOX opts for single-headers those weeks due to their concurrent coverage of the <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Baseball</a> playoffs. Due to CBS's annual coverage of the <a href="../../../../articles/u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28tennis%29_8c25.html" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Open (tennis)">U.S. Open</a>, FOX has had exclusive double-header coverage of opening weekend since 1998. Starting in 2006, both networks air a double-header in week 17.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-TV_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TV-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since 1973, the NFL has operated under a different blackout rule than what previously existed. It was originally a federal law passed in order to show <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> games in the capital city, but has remained part of its standard broadcast and satellite contracts. A regionally broadcast game is "blacked out" in its home market (and possibly adjacent markets) if it does not sell out within 72 hours of its air time, and it will <i>not</i> be shown in such markets; another game will be substituted in its place. This is to encourage ticket sales at stadiums. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>. The rule is specifically exempted from U.S. anti-trust law (Title 15, Sec. 1292 of the U.S. Code), as it would normally not be allowed, much as any sports league's collective sale of national TV rights would also not be legal (the <i>Sports Broadcasting Act</i>). Sports bars and taverns in various places in the U.S. have been sued by the NFL for attempting to circumvent this rule. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, the number of blacked out games has declined significantly during the early 21st century.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: National games">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">National games</span></h3>
<p>National broadcasts of marquee match-ups usually occur on Sunday and Monday nights, and later in the season (after the completion of the <a href="../../../../articles/n/c/a/NCAA_football_1538.html" class="mw-redirect" title="NCAA football">NCAA football</a> season) on Thursday and Saturday nights as well. NBC has broadcast rights to Sunday night games. These are broadcast under a special "<a href="#Flexible-scheduling" title="">flexible schedule</a>" that allows Sunday games (on the last seven weeks of the season that contain a Sunday night game) to be moved from the normal start time of 1:00 p.m. <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone_d793.html" class="mw-redirect" title="North American Eastern Time Zone">ET</a>/10:00 a.m. <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/c/Pacific_Time_Zone_fd43.html" title="Pacific Time Zone">PT</a>, 4:00 p.m. ET/1:00 p.m. PT, or 4:15 p.m. ET/1:15 p.m. PT. to the prime-time slot, and possibly move one or more 1:00 p.m. ET slotted games to the 4:00 p.m. ET slots. This is to have the best game of each week broadcast on national over-the-air television.</p>
<p>During the last week of the season, the league could also re-schedule games as late as six days before the contests so that all of the television networks will be able to broadcast a game that has playoff implications. Both FOX and CBS have the right to "protect" five games each when flexible scheduling for Weeks 11-17 are in place. This allows FOX and CBS to protect at least one marquee game to show on a national scale. Both networks are also allowed to move a 1:00 p.m. ET slotted game to 4:05 p.m. ET or 4:15 p.m. ET during this time of the season. <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> NBC also has broadcast rights to the opening Thursday Night game, which replaces a game taken away when the league omits a Sunday night game during the weekend of the <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> (starting in 2007, the one weekend where Games 3-5 are held). <sup id="cite_ref-TV_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TV-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> has been moved from longtime partner <a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> to ESPN (though it should be noted that both are properties of <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Walt_Disney_Company_cac2.html" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a>). Additionally, the recently created NFL Network will broadcast eight Thursday and Saturday night games for the league starting with a newly-created third Thanksgiving Day game. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-TV_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TV-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Also, satellite broadcast company <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/r/DirecTV_598e.html" title="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> offers <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Sunday_Ticket_cff3.html" title="NFL Sunday Ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a>, a subscription-based package, that allows most Sunday daytime regional games to be watched.

<p>Except for <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football_8fa6.html" title="NBC Sunday Night Football">Sunday Night Football</a></i>, games aired on the <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a>, and other selected contests, most of the regular season games are regionally televised on Sunday afternoon by <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_CBS_99e6.html" title="NFL on CBS">CBS</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_FOX_e308.html" title="NFL on FOX">FOX</a>. In other words, each game is only broadcast to certain <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/d/Media_market.html" title="Media market">media markets</a> in the United States instead of the entire country.</p>
<p>Normally, all media markets receive three games during each Sunday of the regular season: two games by the television network (either CBS or FOX) showing the "<a href="../../../../articles/d/o/u/Doubleheader_%28television%29.html" title="Doubleheader (television)">doubleheader</a>" and one single game by the network showing the single game. The network with the doubleheader televises one game in the "early" time slot (1 p.m. <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Standard_Time_Zone_07e4.html" class="mw-redirect" title="North American Eastern Standard Time Zone">ET</a>/10 a.m. <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/c/Pacific_Standard_Time_Zone_3a67.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Pacific Standard Time Zone">PT</a>) and the other game in the "late" time slot (4:15 ET/1:15 p.m. PT). The network with the single game is also assigned contests in both the early and late time slot but can only show one game in each market. Because of that, the single-game network airs the late time slot games ten minutes earlier at 4:05 ET/1:05 p.m. PT.</p>
<p>The designated "doubleheader" network for each Sunday is determined by the league when it creates the regular season schedule, but it is generally roughly split equally between CBS and FOX. In determining this selection, the NFL has traditionally honored the networks' other major broadcasting commitments. For the past few decades, the league has always let CBS be the single-game network (and only show 1:00 games) during the week it televises the Men's <a href="../../../../articles/u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28tennis%29_8c25.html" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Open (tennis)">U.S. Open Tennis</a> final at 4:05 p.m. ET around the country. In recent years, this has been the first week of the season; prior to 2001, the Men's final fell during the second weekend of the NFL season when the league opened the year on <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/b/Labor_Day_663d.html" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> Weekend.</p>
<p>Starting in the <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2006_NFL_season_05ef.html" title="2006 NFL season">2006 NFL season</a>, both CBS and FOX are given eight total doubleheaders during the first sixteen weeks of the regular season. Both networks will air doubleheaders in the last week of the season to provide national coverage of contests with playoff implications (excluding the markets guaranteed their local teams).</p>
<p>Which games get shown in what particular markets are determined by the following factors: First, each home team's "primary media market," the market in which the team is physically located, must televise all of the away games involving the local team (a vestige of the days when <i>only</i> road games were shown), and all of the home games, provided that they are sold out at least 72 hours prior to kickoff (or else, they are subject to blackout, <i><a href="#Blackout_policies" title="">see below</a></i>). In addition, the league also designates "secondary markets," media markets adjoining primary markets (generally penetrating within 75 miles of a stadium but <i>not</i> having their own team) that are also required to show the local team. Generally, these secondary markets must show the road games but are not obligated to show the designated team's sold out home games. Their decision on whether to show home games typically depends on whether or not the NFL-designated local team is perceived to be the most popular in the market. In all other markets, the networks are the sole arbiters of what game gets shown where. However, they usually make their decisions after consulting with all of their local affiliates. In some rarer occasions, some affiliates are offered a choice of a few games for a given time-slot, if there is not one game that stands out as appropriate.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, CBS and FOX may switch a media market's game to a more competitive one, particularly when a contest becomes one-sided. For this to happen, one of the teams must normally be ahead by at least 18 points in the second half. However, due to the incident involving the "<a href="../../../../articles/h/e/i/Heidi_Game_d23a.html" title="Heidi Game">Heidi Game</a>", a primary media market must show its local team's game in its entirety, and secondary markets usually follow suit for road games. Also, secondary markets (for home games) or any others where one team's popularity stands out may request a <i>constant</i> feed of that game, and in that case will not be switched. If the local team's game is in the late time-slot on the doubleheader network, the primary and secondary markets (usually only for road games in the latter case) may be required to switch coverage from the early game to the start of the late game just before kickoff, so that the local team's contest can be shown in its entirety. The network can show updates and highlights of the early game at its discretion. NFL Sunday Ticket viewers are unaffected, except to the extent that blacked out channels might change as a result.</p>
<p>For this reason, the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> are never scheduled on the same network on the same day (unless they play each other) because they both share the same primary media market. The <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> are treated likewise. Otherwise, the networks could theoretically have to cut away from one team's game to show the other team. In general, the league never schedules the Giants and the Jets to play their games at the same time (except for a head-to-head meeting), and the same usually goes for the 49ers and the Raiders, though this can mean one of those teams will play a road game at 10:00 AM PT. Also, either the 49ers or Raiders will typically be scheduled for a prime-time game, regardless of their records during the previous season.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> The often complicated television package is a significant factor in why the NFL schedule for a particular season takes several weeks to develop.</p>
<p>The same principles which apply to the New York and San Francisco markets were also in effect when the <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">Rams</a> and Raiders shared the <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> market from 1982-94. Like San Francisco, this often meant the Rams or Raiders would be scheduled for a 10 a.m. PT start when on the road.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Sunday bonus coverage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sunday bonus coverage</span></h4>
<p>When a media market's regionally televised game ends before the others, the network (CBS or FOX) may switch to "bonus coverage" of the ending of another game. However, the league imposes a couple of restrictions that are designed to maximize the TV ratings of the late games on the doubleheader network, which tend to record the most NFL viewers during the day (often beating the audience for Sunday night games).</p>
<p>First, bonus coverage offered after any early time slot games cannot be shown past the start of the late time slot (either 4:05 or 4:15 ET). This prevents people from continuing to watch the bonus coverage instead of seeing the beginning of the late doubleheader network's game (which is usually either their local team or the network's featured game). Again, the networks may show highlights of the game after the fact, and usually will at the earliest convenience. The single-header network will sometimes show each play as soon as it ends as part of its post-game show. Of course, any station originally getting the game featured during bonus coverage will stay with it unless they are leaving to show a local team.</p>
<p>Second, bonus coverage cannot be shown after a late game on the single-game network because it will run in opposition to the ending of the late doubleheader network's game(s) and NBC's pre-game show. However, the single-game network usually schedules most of its top games in the early 1:00 ET time slot (except for West Coast teams' home games, and possibly either a Giants or Jets game), so this does not tend to be a major issue.</p>
<p>If the doubleheader network's games all finish before 7:30 ET, it is supposed to conclude the post-game show within 10 minutes to protect NBC's pre-game show. If any games finish after 7:30, the post-game can run until 8:00 ET. However, this restriction seems to apply to game footage only; on several occasions FOX has run its post-game to 8:00, despite all games ending before 7:30, by airing only panel discussions and interviews in the latter portion of the show. This does include reveal of the latest <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/w/Bowl_Championship_Series_5f0c.html" title="Bowl Championship Series">BCS Standings</a> on most weekends FOX has the doubleheader. On the other hand, CBS rarely airs any post-game show after its doubleheaders. This is because <i><a href="../../../../articles/6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> is one of its signature shows, and CBS makes every effort to start it as close to 7:00 (its traditional airtime) as possible. The rule generally seems targeted at FOX, which heavily promotes its <i>The OT presented by Lowe's</i> show to compete with NBC.</p>
<p>These restrictions may not apply during the one week NBC does not have a Sunday night game because of the World Series, which airs on Fox and usually follows the late game on that Sunday.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Flexible-scheduling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flexible-scheduling</span></h3>
<p>Since the <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2006_NFL_season_05ef.html" title="2006 NFL season">2006 season</a>, the NFL has used a "flexible-scheduling" system for the last seven weeks of the regular season where there is a Sunday night game. The system is designed so that the league has the flexibility in selecting games to air on Sunday night that will feature a more even or intriguing contest as well as make it possible for teams to play into prime time, so to speak.</p>
<p>Under the system, all Sunday games in the affected weeks will tentatively have the "early" start time of 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT, except those played in the Pacific or Mountain time zones, which will have the tentative start time of 4:05 p.m. ET/1:05 p.m. PT. Also, there will be one game provisionally slotted into the 8:15 slot. On the Tuesday 12 days before the games, the league will move one game to the prime-time slot (or keep its original choice), and possibly move one or more 1 p.m. slotted games to the 4:05/4:15 p.m. slot. During the last week of the season, the league could re-schedule games as late as six days before the contests so that as many of the television networks as possible will be able to broadcast a game that has playoff implications. Each network protects five games for the 1 p.m. or 4:05/4:15 p.m. slot (no more than one per week), and the other games are subject to being moved to 8:15 p.m., except in the final week of the season, when all games are affected and both networks schedule 4:15 p.m. late starts for double header, meaning in a city where a home game is not being played, as many as five games can air.</p>

<p>To maximize TV ratings, as well as protect the NFL's ability to sell TV rights collectively, games televised on ESPN or the NFL Network are simulcast on a local broadcast station in each of the primary markets of both teams (the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> have two primary markets, Green Bay and Milwaukee). However, the home team's market can only air the game if it is sold out within 72 hours of kick-off (<a href="#Blackout_policies" title="">see below</a>).</p>
<p>To date, the league has never awarded broadcasting rights of a playoff or Super Bowl game to any cable television network or DBS service, though this may happen in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p><a name="Blackout_policies" id="Blackout_policies"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Blackout policies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blackout policies</span></h3>
<p>Since 1973, the NFL has maintained a blackout policy that states that a home game cannot be televised locally if it is not sold out within 72 hours prior to its start time. Prior to 1973, all games were blacked out in their city of origin regardless of whether they were sold out. This policy, dating back to the NFL's emerging years on television, resulted in home-city blackouts that even extended to championship games. For instance, the 1958 <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Championship_Game%2C_1958_9a79.html" title="NFL Championship Game, 1958">"Greatest Game Ever Played"</a> between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants was not available on TV to New York fans despite the fact that tickets were out of reach to most. For years, Giants fans would migrate to Connecticut motel rooms every home weekend where they could watch the games beamed on <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Hartford%2C_Connecticut_02b3.html" title="Hartford, Connecticut">Hartford</a>/<a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven</a>'s CBS affiliate <a href="../../../../articles/w/f/s/WFSB_f6bc.html" title="WFSB">WTIC</a> (Channel 3). Similarly, all Super Bowl games prior to <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_VII_b10d.html" title="Super Bowl VII">Super Bowl VII</a> were blacked out in the host city's market.</p>
<p>Although that policy was successfully defended in court numerous times, Congress passed legislation requiring the NFL to impose the 72-hour deadline (see above). The league will sometimes extend this deadline to 48 hours if there are only a few thousand tickets left unsold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some NFL teams have arrangements with local TV stations or businesses to buy up unsold tickets. Tickets in premium "club" sections have been excluded from the blackout rule in past years, as have tickets returned by the visiting team. The <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jacksonville_Jaguars_c078.html" title="Jacksonville Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> have even gone further and closed off a number of sections at their home <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jacksonville_Municipal_Stadium_83b7.html" title="Jacksonville Municipal Stadium">Jacksonville Municipal Stadium</a> to reduce the number of tickets they would need to sell (Jacksonville Municipal Stadium is one of the largest in the NFL, as it was built to also accommodate the annual <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_World%27s_Largest_Outdoor_Cocktail_Party_eb66.html" title="The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party">Florida-Georgia game</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/t/Gator_Bowl_6b3f.html" title="Gator Bowl">Gator Bowl</a>, but Jacksonville is one of the smallest markets in the league). However, the NFL requires that this be done for every home game in a given season if a team elects such an option, so that they can't try to sell out the entire stadium only when they expect to be able to do so.</p>
<p>The NFL defines "locally" as within a 75-mile radius of the stadium. Therefore, a TV blackout affects any market whose broadcast signal penetrates into the 75-mile radius. Some primary media markets, such as Denver and Phoenix, may cover that entire radius and so the blackout would not affect any other markets.</p>
<p>An exception to the 75-mile rule is the market area for the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, which stretches out to both the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Green_Bay%2C_Wisconsin_091b.html" title="Green Bay, Wisconsin">Green Bay</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin_a6b4.html" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a> television markets (the team's <a href="../../../../articles/w/t/m/WTMJ-AM_9103.html" class="mw-redirect" title="WTMJ-AM">radio flagship station</a> is in Milwaukee, and two Packer home games a year were played at <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Milwaukee_County_Stadium_9432.html" title="Milwaukee County Stadium">Milwaukee County Stadium</a> until 1994). However, blackout rules rarely come into effect for the Packers, due to a four-decade long streak of sellouts and a decades-long season ticket waiting list.</p>
<p>Another policy to ensure a filled-up stadium is that no other NFL games can air on local TV at the same time as a team's home game in the club's primary market. This is to prevent ticket-holders from opting to watch the other locally televised NFL game instead of showing up at the stadium. Thus when a team's home game is on the network showing a single game, the network televising the doubleheader can only broadcast one game into that club's primary market; instead of showing a second game in the same time slot as the home game, the doubleheader network's local station must broadcast alternative programming (often movies or infomercials). When the doubleheader network has a team's home game, the other station might program the time themselves or air some other network programming scheduled for the non-NFL time-slot. However, this rule was relaxed in the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Metropolitan_Area_6371.html" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Metropolitan Area">New York Metropolitan Area</a> during Week 17 of the <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2007_NFL_season_aee4.html" title="2007 NFL season">2007 NFL season</a>. Viewers were able to watch the <a href="../../../../articles/k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> at the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> which was broadcast on CBS (<a href="../../../../articles/w/c/b/WCBS_e606.html" title="WCBS">WCBS</a>) and the <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> at the <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> which was broadcast on FOX (<a href="../../../../articles/w/n/y/WNYW_048a.html" title="WNYW">WNYW</a>) during the 4:15 PM timeslot despite the Jets playing their home game at <a href="../../../../articles/g/i/a/Giants_Stadium_3dd9.html" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a>. The NFL relaxed the rule because the Jets and Chiefs game was meaningless while the Redskins and Cowboys game had playoff implication.</p>
<p>Each TV market, including one hosting a non-sold-out game, is assured of at least one televised game in the early and late time slots, one game on each network, but no "network doubleheader" in a market originating a non-sold-out game.</p>
<p>The New York and San Francisco Bay Area media markets typically get fewer doubleheaders than other markets since each has two teams, and one of them is at home virtually every week. The main exception is when one of the teams is idle, has its home game televised on the doubleheader network, or is chosen for a prime-time game. This policy affects only the club's primary market, not others with signals that penetrate inside the 75-mile radius. It also does not affect viewers of <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Sunday_Ticket_cff3.html" title="NFL Sunday Ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> in the primary market; all other games remain available.</p>
<p>If a home game is blacked out locally because it is not sold out before the 72-hour deadline, one of the following things will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the blacked out home game is a nationally televised game on a broadcast network, like <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football_8fa6.html" title="NBC Sunday Night Football">NBC Sunday Night Football</a></i>, where no other NFL games are played at the same time, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must broadcast alternative programming (the stations have to program the time themselves, since other affiliates are carrying the game).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the blacked-out nationally televised game is on a <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable television</a> network like <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> or the <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a>, all cable and <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/t/Satellite_television.html" title="Satellite television">satellite television</a> providers in the affected markets must black out the cable network's signal to customers in the affected markets during the game (this is a condition of the channels' agreements with both the league and the providers). In addition, the game is not simulcast on a local broadcast station in the blacked-out markets. Local stations would still be able to show highlights on their newscasts after the game has concluded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the blacked-out home game is played on a Sunday afternoon, all local stations inside the 75-mile radius must show a different NFL game during that time slot (the network typically chooses the game). Also, <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Sunday_Ticket_cff3.html" title="NFL Sunday Ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> cannot offer the game into that area. As stated earlier, the doubleheader network can broadcast only one game into that team's primary market (usually the #1 game), which is also designed to prevent people from opting to watch the other locally televised NFL games instead of going to the local team's game. Again, the secondary markets would still carry a doubleheader. Sometimes, the networks will switch time slots so that the doubleheader network can still show its featured 4:15 game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Critics claim that these blackout policies are not really effective in creating sold-out, filled stadiums. Rather, there are other factors that cause non-sellouts, such as high ticket prices and the fact that people do not want to support a losing team. Furthermore, TV blackouts may actually hurt the league; without the TV exposure, it becomes more difficult for those teams with low attendance and few sellouts to increase their popularity and following. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, the NFL has sold out well over 90 percent of games in recent seasons. Additionally, many teams sell out their entire regular season schedule before it begins (usually through season-ticket sales), and so there is no threat of a blackout in those markets. In addition, some teams with recent losing records like the <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> still sell out all their home games due to the rabid fan bases of such teams who watch their team regardless of how good or bad the team is doing. Fans of other NFL teams such as the <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> (among others) also have no fear of blackouts in their local markets due to years-long waiting lists for season tickets.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of the TV era, <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> was a prime innovator in football coverage. They became the first major <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">television network</a> to cover an NFL game, when on <a href="../../../../articles/o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, they televised a game between the <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/o/Brooklyn_Dodgers_%28NFL%29_4855.html" title="Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>.</p>

The <a href="../../../../articles/d/u/m/DuMont_Television_Network_a40a.html" title="DuMont Television Network">DuMont Network</a> then paid a rights fee of <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>75,000 to televise the 1951 NFL Championship Game across the entire <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>

<p>When the rival <a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_Football_League_76b2.html" title="American Football League">American Football League</a> (AFL) began in 1960, they signed a 5-year contract with <a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> to cover their games. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players "miked" during broadcast games.</p>
<p>The NFL followed suit in 1962 with its own revenue sharing plan after CBS agreed to telecast all regular season games for an annual fee of $4.65 million. CBS' fee later increased to $14.1 million per year in 1964, and $18.8 million per year in 1966.</p>
<p>With NBC paying the AFL $36 million in 1965 to televise its games, and the increased, heated battle over college prospects, both leagues negotiated a merger agreement on <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. Although they would not officially merge into one combined league until 1970, one of the conditions of the agreement was that the winners of each league's championship game would meet in a contest to determine the "world champion of football".</p>
<p>The first ever <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_I_2d19.html" title="Super Bowl I">AFL-NFL World Championship Game</a> was played on <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. Because CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL games, it was decided to have both of them cover that first game. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, later renamed the <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_II_8b33.html" title="Super Bowl II">II</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_IV_bb10.html" title="Super Bowl IV">IV</a> while NBC covered <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_III_d832.html" title="Super Bowl III">III</a>.</p>

<p>When the AFL and the NFL officially merged in 1970, the combined league divided its teams into the <a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_Football_Conference_f0dc.html" title="American Football Conference">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) and the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/National_Football_Conference_d886.html" title="National Football Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC). It was then decided that CBS would televise all NFC teams (including playoff games) while NBC all AFC teams. For interconference games, CBS would broadcast them if the <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/m/Home_team.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Home team">visiting team</a> was from the NFC and NBC would carry them when the visitors were from the AFC. (The effect of this was that except for Monday Night games, CBS televised all games in which an NFC team was the visiting team, and NBC televised all games in which an AFC team was the visiting team.) The two networks also divided up the Super Bowl on a yearly rotation.</p>
<p>Also, ABC agreed to televise one regular season game per week on Monday night. ABC aired its first edition of <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> on <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. <i>MNF</i> itself pushed the limits of football coverage with its halftime highlights segment, occasional banter from <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/w/Howard_Cosell_b2f6.html" title="Howard Cosell">Howard Cosell</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Dennis_Miller_e18e.html" title="Dennis Miller">Dennis Miller</a>, and celebrity guests such as <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">President Clinton</a>. During its 36-year run on ABC, <i>Monday Night Football</i> consistently ranked among the most popular primetime broadcasts each week during the NFL season.</p>
<p>As the league's broadcasters, ABC, CBS, and NBC had their own talent. Announcers such as Cosell, <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Frank_Gifford_fbea.html" title="Frank Gifford">Frank Gifford</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/_/Al_Michaels_9ec3.html" title="Al Michaels">Al Michaels</a> (from ABC); <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/t/Pat_Summerall_86ec.html" title="Pat Summerall">Pat Summerall</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Madden_%28football%29_3886.html" class="mw-redirect" title="John Madden (football)">John Madden</a> (from CBS); and <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/r/Curt_Gowdy_537b.html" title="Curt Gowdy">Curt Gowdy</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/c/Dick_Enberg_924d.html" title="Dick Enberg">Dick Enberg</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marv_Albert_9220.html" title="Marv Albert">Marv Albert</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Simpson_%28commentator%29_1663.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Jim Simpson (commentator)">Jim Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/k/y/l/Kyle_Rote_1092.html" title="Kyle Rote">Kyle Rote</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Lampley_bc3f.html" title="Jim Lampley">Jim Lampley</a> (from NBC), all had their own unique analysis of the game. Even the individual networks' football coverage was innovative. For example, CBS' <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_NFL_Today_ad56.html" title="The NFL Today">The NFL Today</a></i> was the first pre-game show to have a female co-host (<a href="../../../../articles/p/h/y/Phyllis_George_688b.html" title="Phyllis George">Phyllis George</a>).

NBC has also tried one-announcer football and even the first female play-by-play football announcer (which in its own way, set the mold for female sportscasters of today).</p>
<p>In 1978, the NFL increased their revenue from both ticket sales and TV by expanding the regular season from 14 games to 16. Furthermore, the playoff format was expanded from 8 teams to 10 teams, enabling the league to give another post-season game each to CBS and NBC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Super Bowl became a yearly ratings blockbuster, allowing the network that aired it to generate millions of dollars in advertising revenue. Four of the ten highest rated television broadcasts of all-time (in the U.S.) are Super Bowls.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> When the league signed a new 5-year TV contract with the three networks in 1982, it allowed ABC to enter into the Super Bowl rotation; <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XIX_954f.html" title="Super Bowl XIX">Super Bowl XIX</a> was the first that ABC televised. Since then, the network that televises each Super Bowl is determined by the TV contracts that the league negotiates with all of its broadcasters. The network broadcasters generally each get one Super Bowl before any of them gets a second one, and the process repeats before any network airs a third one (although the TV contracts usually expire by then).</p>

<p>The middle of the 1980s ushered in the cable era, and the NFL was eager to exploit that opportunity in 1987.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> became the first cable network to broadcast regular season NFL games. <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Chris_Berman_14c2.html" title="Chris Berman">Chris Berman</a> helped redefine the pre- and post-game shows when he launched <i>NFL Countdown</i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Primetime_fa9c.html" title="NFL Primetime">NFL Primetime</a></i>, and they have since become the top-rated pre- and post-game shows on television. The cable network's contract to show <i><a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_Sunday_Night_Football_da9b.html" title="ESPN Sunday Night Football">ESPN Sunday Night Football</a></i> marked a turning point for ESPN, transforming it from a small cable network to a marketing empire.</p>
<p>When ESPN first started televising NFL games in 1987, it only broadcast Sunday night games during the second half of the season. Meanwhile, ABC, CBS, and NBC maintained their rights to <i>Monday Night Football</i>, the NFC, and the AFC, respectively.</p>
<p>By 1990, <a href="../../../../articles/t/u/r/Turner_Broadcasting_System_8ede.html" title="Turner Broadcasting System">Turner</a>'s <a href="../../../../articles/t/u/r/Turner_Network_Television_1fb6.html" title="Turner Network Television">TNT</a> network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season. The combined 1990 contracts with ABC, CBS, ESPN, NBC, and TNT totaled to $3.6 billion ($900 million per year), the largest in TV history. One major factor in the increased TV rights fee was that the league changed the regular season so that all NFL teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period. ABC was also given the rights to televise two playoff games per year, which was made possible after the league also expanded its playoff format to include more teams.</p>
<p>In 1994, the league signed an exclusivity agreement with the <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/r/Direct_broadcast_satellite.html" title="Direct broadcast satellite">direct broadcast satellite</a> (DBS) service <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/r/DirecTV_598e.html" title="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> to launch <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Sunday_Ticket_cff3.html" title="NFL Sunday Ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a>, a <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/t/Satellite_television.html" title="Satellite television">satellite television</a> subscription service that offers every regular season NFL game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Broadcast realignments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Broadcast realignments</span></h3>
<p>When new TV contracts were signed in December 1993, CBS (which had been home to NFC games for 38 years) lost their rights to the then-fledging <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX Network</a>. FOX offered a then-record $1.58 billion to the NFL over four years for the rights, significantly more than the $290 million CBS was willing to pay. FOX was only seven years old and had no sports division, but it began building its own coverage by hiring many former CBS personalities such as Summerall and Madden. FOX's NFL rights ownership made the network a major player in American television by giving it many new viewers (and affiliates) and a platform to advertise its other shows. In the meantime, CBS lost several affiliates (mainly owned by <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_World_Communications_0192.html" title="New World Communications">New World Communications</a>) to FOX, and ratings for its other programming languished. To this day, CBS admits they have never recovered from the loss of affiliates, primarily in Atlanta, Detroit, and Milwaukee, where they were dropped to lower-powered affiliates unable to be received in some areas. (Because of satellite television, the NFL Sunday Ticket in local markets, and rules of the time, satellite subscribers were required to use antennas to pick up local affiliates. CBS was devastated by the loss of over-the-air availability of these stations in the outer reaches of some markets.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NBC's rebound in their overall ratings in both the 1980s and 1990s (after years in the bottom of the ratings cellar) were attributed in part to its continuing coverage of the NFL. But with television contract re-negotiations in early 1998 ushering in the era of multi-billion dollar broadcasting agreements, an era of pro football broadcasting would soon came to an unceremonious conclusion. CBS, stung by FOX's surprise bid four years earlier, aggressively sought to reacquire some broadcasting rights. CBS agreed to pay $4 billion over eight years ($500 million per season) to air AFC games. NBC, meanwhile, had indicated a desire to bid for <i>Monday Night Football</i> rights in 1998, but gave up when the financial stakes skyrocketed. And so, after six decades, NBC, the network that helped define pro football on television, lost its rights to air the NFL, thus marking the beginning of a slow decline for the Peacock network's sports division, resulting in the devastating 2004-05 prime-time season, when NBC carried no major sporting championships during prime-time (NBC had already lost <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_on_NBC_bffe.html" title="Major League Baseball on NBC">Major League Baseball</a> broadcasting rights in <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2000_in_baseball.html" title="2000 in baseball">2000</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/a/NBA_on_NBC_0f96.html" title="NBA on NBC">National Basketball Association</a> rights in <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2001-02_NBA_season_7572.html" class="mw-redirect" title="2001-02 NBA season">2002</a>), something the other networks carried. Like CBS before it, NBC would later decide that not having NFL rights did too much damage to its overall ratings to justify not paying the high rights fees required.</p>
<p>The other networks also signed eight-year deals in 1998. FOX extended its NFC deal by agreeing to a $4.4 billion contract ($550 million per season). ABC retained its longtime rights to <i>Monday Night Football</i> by also paying $4.4 billion over eight years. And ESPN agreed to a $4.8 billion ($600 million a season) deal to become the sole cable broadcaster of NFL games, marking an end with the league's association with TNT. And like previous TV contracts, the coverage of the Super Bowl was divided between the broadcast networks.</p>

<p>In 2002, the NFL began scheduling a <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Kickoff_game_94c0.html" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL Kickoff game">Thursday night special opening "Kickoff" game</a>, which included a pre-game concert to start the season.

The game was such a huge success that the next three Kickoff Games from 2003 to 2005 were given to ABC. Since 2006, NBC has televised the Kickoff game (<i><a href="#Financial_losses_leads_to_another_realignment" title="">see below</a></i>).</p>
<p>The NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense.</p>

<p>Currently, the NFL's TV broadcasters have suffered annual financial losses because advertising revenue is unable to meet the cost incurred by the purchase of broadcast rights.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the current broadcast contract, which began in the 2006 season, resulted in a sizable increase in total rights fees. Both FOX and CBS renewed their Sunday afternoon broadcast packages through 2011, in both cases with modest increases. Furthermore, the league and DirecTV signed a five year extension to their exclusivity deal on NFL Sunday Ticket.</p>
<p>But despite relatively high, if declining, TV ratings, ABC decided to end its relationship with the NFL after losing significant sums of money on <i>Monday Night Football</i>. In addition to the fees issue, part of this decision may have been the result of a resurgent ABC primetime entertainment schedule during the 2004-05 season, particularly on Sunday evening; thus ABC would be unable to satisfy the league's reported preference for a Sunday night game on broadcast television as opposed to Monday.</p>
<p>Because of that, <i>Monday Night Football</i> moved to <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, with the cable network paying a large sum of $1.1 billion per year from 2006 to 2014 for the rights to the lucrative franchise. Unlike the broadcast networks, however, ESPN can generate revenue from subscription sales, in addition to traditional commercial breaks. The cable network's coverage begins at 1 p.m. <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Standard_Time_ea5d.html" class="mw-redirect" title="North American Eastern Standard Time">ET</a> with <i><a href="../../../../articles/s/p/o/SportsCenter_52cb.html" title="SportsCenter">SportsCenter Special Edition: Monday Night Kickoff</a></i>.

In addition, other shows such as <i><a href="../../../../articles/p/a/r/Pardon_the_Interruption_221e.html" title="Pardon the Interruption">Pardon the Interruption</a></i> are on location from the site of the game that week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NBC, after losing the AFC package to CBS in 1997, has reclaimed its share of the NFL broadcast rights with a deal worth an average of $650 million per year from 2006 to 2012 (not much more than ESPN used to pay for the Sunday night package). This new deal includes the Super Bowl in 2009 and 2012, a likely means of reversing its current ratings slump. NBC's coverage also includes three preseason games, the first two Wild Card playoff games of each post-season, and the annual Thursday opening Kickoff Game. The network will also have <a href="#Flexible-scheduling" title="">flexibility in selecting games</a> in the latter part of the season. It is essentially the package ABC previously had.</p>
<p>Coverage of <i><a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football_8fa6.html" title="NBC Sunday Night Football">NBC Sunday Night Football</a></i> starts at 8:15 p.m. ET with <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/_/Al_Michaels_9ec3.html" title="Al Michaels">Al Michaels</a> serving as the <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Play-by-play.html" title="Play-by-play">play-by-play</a> announcer, <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Madden_%28football%29_3886.html" class="mw-redirect" title="John Madden (football)">John Madden</a> as <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/l/Color_commentator.html" title="Color commentator">color commentator</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/d/Andrea_Kremer_5652.html" title="Andrea Kremer">Andrea Kremer</a> as the sole sideline reporter.

<p>In addition, the network that carries the Super Bowl will also broadcast the <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> on the Saturday night following the championship game. In the calendar year 2007, CBS broadcast both games, followed by Fox in 2008, and NBC in 2009.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a> was created by the league in 2003 and given a separate package of games to air.

<p>The NFL is a major part of <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> celebrations in the United States. The <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a> have hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day since 1934 (with the exception of 1939-1944 due to <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>), and they have been nationally televised since 1962. In 1966, the NFL introduced an annual game hosted by the <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, which they have played every year except in 1975 and 1977 when the <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/i/Arizona_Cardinals_c8e5.html" title="Arizona Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> hosted a game instead. However, St. Louis football fans, used to the traditional "<a href="../../../../articles/a/m/e/American_football_on_Thanksgiving_13f7.html#In_Missouri" title="American football on Thanksgiving">Turkey Day Game</a>" between <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/r/Kirkwood_High_School_087a.html" title="Kirkwood High School">Kirkwood High School</a> and Webster Groves High School as the only local match on Thanksgiving, did not respond well to an NFL game on the same day, and thus Dallas resumed hosting the game in 1978.</p>
<p>When the AFL began holding annual Thanksgiving Day games, the league chose a different model - circulating the game among several cities. During the 1967-69 seasons, two Thanksgiving AFL games were televised each year.</p>
<p>After the 1970 merger, the NFL decided to keep only the traditional Detroit and Dallas games. Due to the broadcast contracts in place since 1970, three NFC teams play on Thanksgiving, as opposed to only one AFC team. During even years, the Lions play their Thanksgiving game against an AFC team, and thus are televised by the network holding the AFC package (NBC and later CBS); the Cowboys host an NFC team and are shown by the network with the NFC package (CBS and later FOX). During odd years, Dallas hosts an AFC team and Detroit plays an NFC opponent. Every decade or so, this even-odd rotation is reversed — with Detroit hosting an NFC team in even years and an AFC team in odd years, and Dallas hosting an AFC team in even years and an NFC team in odd years.</p>
<p>When the league created its new TV package for the <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a> in 2006, a third Thanksgiving game was added, a prime time event beginning after the first two games had finished.

<p>In recent years, the NFL has generally scheduled games on <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> only if it falls on a day normally used for games (Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). If Christmas falls on a Sunday, as it did in 2005, most of the games will be played on the preceding day (with no games that night or the following afternoon in deference to the holiday), and then one or two games are scheduled for Christmas Night to be broadcast nationally. One game would be held over for the regular Monday night slot and one would already have been played on Thursday. Through the <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2006_NFL_season_05ef.html" title="2006 NFL season">2006 season</a>, there have been 14 such Christmas contests.</p>
<p>The first NFL games actually played on <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> came after the merger during the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1971_NFL_season_cfb3.html" title="1971 NFL season">1971 season</a>. The first two games of the Divisional Playoff Round were held on Christmas Day. However, the second of the two contests played that day, the Miami Dolphins versus the <a href="../../../../articles/k/a/n/Kansas_City_Chiefs_89f3.html" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, wound up being <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_playoffs%2C_1971-72_0e91.html#AFC:_Miami_Dolphins_27.2C_Kansas_City_Chiefs_24_.282OT.29" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL playoffs, 1971-72">the longest game in NFL history</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Because of the length of this game, the league received numerous complaints, reportedly due to the fact that it caused havoc with Christmas dinners around the nation. As a result, the NFL decided to not schedule any Christmas Day matches for the 17 years that followed.</p>
<p>The NFL continued to avoid Christmas even after it started to increase the regular season and the playoffs. The league expanded to a 16-game regular season and a 10-team playoff tournament in 1978, but it was not until 1982 that the regular season ended after Christmas, due to the player's strike. Finally, in 1989, the NFL tried another Christmas Day game, the <a href="../../../../articles/c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> at the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>, but it was a 9 p.m. ET <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> contest, thereby avoiding interfering with family dinners. In the years since, the NFL has played an occasional late-afternoon or night game on the holiday; but there has not been a Christmas Day game starting earlier than 5 p.m. ET since 1971.</p>
<p>There have also been several games played on <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christmas_Eve_b7d8.html" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a> over the years, the most famous of these being a <a href="../../../../articles/o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>-<a href="../../../../articles/h/i/s/History_of_the_Indianapolis_Colts_00a2.html" title="History of the Indianapolis Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> playoff contest in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> which culminated in a play immortalized as "<a href="../../../../articles/g/h/o/Ghost_to_the_Post_cc08.html" title="Ghost to the Post">Ghost to the Post</a>". These games have typically been played during the afternoon out of deference to the holiday. If Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, then most of the weekend's NFL games will be on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, except for a few games held over for the Sunday and Monday TV packages.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, television contract obligations led to the league scheduling its first prime-time Christmas Eve game, when the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> met the <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> in San Diego on December 24, which happened to be a Monday. This game started at 5 P.M. local time (8 P.M. Eastern), and both teams were from the western United States.</p>
<p>Based upon current television contracts, the next Christmas game will take place during the 2009 NFL season. Whether it will be on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>The NFL also never plays games on New Year's Day in any year in which <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> is a non-Sunday, deferring to the numerous New Year's Day <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a> <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/w/Bowl_games.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Bowl games">bowl games</a> that are traditionally held on that day.

<p>Between 1970 and 1977, and again since 2003, there has been no Monday Night game during the last week of the season. From 1978 until 2002, a season-ending Monday Night game was scheduled. The 2003 revision permits the NFL to have all eight teams involved in the Wild Card playoffs to have equal time in preparation, instead of the possibility of one or two teams having a short week of preparation for their playoff game if they were picked to play on Saturday, instead of Sunday. Note, however, that this scenario, in which a team finishing its season on Monday night had a playoff game the following Saturday, never occurred.</p>
<p>There have been a few occasions when two Monday night games were played simultaneously. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1987_NFL_season_e726.html" title="1987 NFL season">1987</a>, a scheduling conflict arose when <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> went to Game 7 of the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1987_World_Series_31b3.html" title="1987 World Series">World Series</a>, making the <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/b/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome_d019.html" title="Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> unavailable for the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>' scheduled game that Sunday. The Vikings game was subsequently moved to Monday night, and ABC aired it in a split telecast with the regularly-scheduled <i>MNF</i> game. A similar scenario unfolded in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1997_NFL_season_dc0b.html" title="1997 NFL season">1997</a>, when the <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/o/Florida_Marlins_0c4d.html" title="Florida Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> went to Game 7 of the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1997_World_Series_b3c8.html" title="1997 World Series">World Series</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>' Sunday game at <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_Player_Stadium_1466.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Pro Player Stadium">Pro Player Stadium</a> was shifted to Monday night.

The Saints-Giants game was seen in its entirety in New York, Louisiana and other hurricane-affected areas on ABC, with the regularly-scheduled <i>MNF</i> game shown on ESPN until the end of the first game.</p>
<p>In 2006, ESPN opened the season with a Monday Night Football doubleheader, with a 7 p.m. game and a 10:30 p.m. both shown in their entirety nationwide. This was repeated in 2007. On <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> 2006, which fell on a Monday, the <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> clashed with the <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> on an <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> special in the late afternoon, and later the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_York_Jets_c84e.html" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> played the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> for ESPN's usual Monday Night game.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_on_television_9b58.html" title="Edit section: Leverage over the networks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leverage over the networks</span></h2>
<p>The NFL's status as a prime offering by the networks has led some to conclude that unbiased coverage of the league is not possible, although this may be true of most sports. ESPN attempted to run a dramatic series showing steamier aspects of pro football, <i><a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Playmakers.html" title="Playmakers">Playmakers</a></i>, but dropped the series after the league reportedly threatened to exclude the network from carrying its games under the next set of TV contracts.</p>
<p>The NFL also has a strict policy prohibiting networks to run ads during official NFL programming (pre and post-game studio shows and the games themselves) from the <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> industry, and has rejected some ads from the <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Convention_and_Visitors_Authority_f285.html" title="Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority">Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority</a>. Commissioner <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/g/Roger_Goodell_4a7b.html" title="Roger Goodell">Roger Goodell</a> explained in 2007 that he did not think it behooved the sport to associate with sports betting. <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> Additionally, the networks and their announcers cannot discuss or run graphics showing point spreads during NFL shows (<a href="../../../../articles/a/l/_/Al_Michaels_9ec3.html" title="Al Michaels">Al Michaels</a>, among other announcers, has been known to allude to them on-air, particularly at the end of the game where a seemingly insignificant score can have a major effect on the point-spread outcome.) Most teams also insert similar clauses into their radio contracts, which are locally negotiated. The NFL injury report and required videotaping of practice are theoretically intended to prevent gamblers from gaining inside information. In contrast, <a href="../../../../articles/f/a/n/Fantasy_football.html" title="Fantasy football">fantasy football</a> is often free to play.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, "<i>Name of broadcaster</i> welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League" is announced, while at the end of the game, the message is "<i>Name of broadcaster</i> thanks you for watching this presentation of the National Football League". This announcement is designed to separate game coverage from news, sports analysis, or entertainment programming not under the NFL contract and NFL ownership. Also, since 1998, the NFL has owned the rights to game broadcasts once they air-- a copyright disclaimer airs either before the start of the second half or after the first commercial break of the second half, depending on the broadcaster (<i>"This telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience, and any other use of this telecast or of any pictures, descriptions or accounts of the game without the NFL's consent is prohibited"</i>). Only the NFL Network can re-air games; they pick a few each week.</p>
<p>Further, the NFL imposes restrictions on sponsored segments during game coverage (this does not apply to national or local radio broadcasts). These are permitted only prior to kickoff, during halftime, and following the game (once the "...welcomes you to the following presentation.." notice appears, the restrictions take effect until half-time, and again until the game ends); however, these segments (and other programming with title sponsorships, particularly halftime and post-game shows or other sports properties) can be advertised a couple of times during game coverage, and "aerial footage" providers (i.e. sponsored <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/n/Non-rigid_airship.html" title="Non-rigid airship">blimps</a>) may be acknowledged, usually once an hour as is standard in other sports. Other acknowledgments (including <a href="../../../../articles/h/d/t/HDTV_76ec.html" class="mw-redirect" title="HDTV">HDTV</a> or <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/y/Skycam.html" title="Skycam">Skycam</a>-type camera sponsorships) are limited to pre-kickoff and post-game credits. This is done so that, while competitors of the NFL's official sponsors may advertise on game broadcasts, they will not potentially become synonymous with the league through in-game and/or title sponsorship.</p>
<p>Finally, sideline reporters are restricted as to whom they can speak to and when (usually a head coach at halftime, and one or two players before and after the game ends). Information on injured players or rules interpretations are relayed from NFL off-field officials to the TV producers in the truck, who then pass it along to the sideline reporters or booth announcers. Thus, CBS opted in 2006 to no longer use sideline reporters except for some playoff games. ESPN will follow suit by reducing the roles of their sideline reporters in 2008.</p>
