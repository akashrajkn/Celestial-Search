<p>St. Theresa's College, Cebu City, was originally incorporated in accordance with Philippine Laws on <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">March 29</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. After <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Articles of Incorporation were duly reconstituted and with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Manila, October 1948. The transcript of these amended Articles of Incorporation was issued on September 8, 1949. In February 1991, the papers of Incorporation registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission were revised.</p>
<p>Until August 1991 the members of the Board of Trustees of St. Theresa's College, Cebu were the ICM District Superior and her Council. Today, St. Theresa's College, Cebu is governed by a separate Board of Trustees with ten (10) members, six (6) of whom are ICM’s and four (4) non-ICM's.</p>
<p>In 1984, an Ad Hoc Committee as formed to valuate ICM school programs with the end view of integrating the school into the community, particularly in relation to Christian community building and action for justice and peace. The ICM schools in the 1990’s continued on the path of being in solidarity with the massive efforts of the Filipino people and other Third World countries to become shapers of their own destiny as they work towards education to LIBERATION, JUSTICE, PEACE and SOLIDARITY. Here lies the social role of the Catholic school as a private institution of learning. The ICM schools in the new millennium respond to the challenges brought about by globalization like the preservation of Mother Earth, protection of the rights of women and children and promotion of fair labor practices.</p>

<p>The Community Involvement Program (CIP) of Saint Theresa’s College Cebu is an expression of the school’s missionary spirit as inspired by Mother Marie Louise de Meester, in her undaunted apostolic life, love for the poor, daring spirit and a strong sense of mission. It is meant to nurture the service orientation of the school’s social thrust, and to raise the level of consciousness and commitment of the entire school community to be in dialogue with the people in their inspirations and the school community’s life values.</p>
<p>It is geared towards the realization of the institutional vision, mission and goal based on the integration of curriculum, research and community involvement. CIP is a partnership of the school with communities, characterized by mutuality as expressed in activities based on common concerns. Partnership means that CIP is the work of everyone, the CIP personnel, the whole school and the partner communities as well.</p>

<p>The CI program is based on the commitment of STC-Cebu to provide a ‘transformative education that is discerning and reflective, geared towards the empowerment of the school community and a spirituality that promotes truth, freedom, justice, love and peace’..</p>
<p>As part of the whole educational program of ICM schools, the Community Involvement Program promotes the ICM vision-mission, and STC institutional goal which draw inspiration from Mary in her Magnificat and from Mother Marie Louise de Meester, foundress of the ICM congregation, who was imbued with deep interior lofe, undaunted apostolic zeal, love for the poor, daring spirit and a strong sense of mission.</p>
<p>Through CIP, St. Theresa’s College continues to be on solidarity with the massive efforts of the Filipino people, with the Third World countries and the poor all over the world to transform the world community. Through a liberating and transformative education, STC continually listens to, discerns with, and reflects on the development of history and the signs of the times, living as one community with compassion, justice and discernment as a way of life.</p>
<p>Through community building activities, the students contribute to the general welfare and improvement of the quality of life of the members of the community while learning the values of social responsibility and service. On the other hand, the partner communities provide valuable learning experiences for the students through exposure and interaction with real life situations of people in the depressed communities.</p>
<p>Tapping the rich human and academic resources of the three departments, namely the Grade School, the High School, and the College, CIP is a service program in five partner communities focused on addressing issues of women and children, and care for the earth.</p>

<p>CIP’s spiral growth of involvement is a framework that is applicable both to the school and partner community in establishing mutual relationship. We consider that each person has different levels of readiness for involvement and can grow, as the individual undergoes different experiences that can deepen his/her commitment for involvement.</p>
<p>CIP’s spiral growth of involvement starts with INFORMATION. This level aims that a person be equipped of the correct understanding and right attitude towards any given situation, event or phenomena so as to act appropriately in accordance to Christian teachings. This level involves activities such as orientation, seminar training, exposure and community visits, and discussion, for a, data gathering, and information dissemination and other educational activities.</p>
<p>The next level is FORMATION. Once the person is knowledgeable and guided by what she/he is capable to do in a situation, it is inevitable that the person is drawn to participate or to be involved to make the situation better. To contribute in whatever way it can be significant. In the process, change is happening to the person. By going out of oneself, by repeatedly doing constant visit to communities and agencies, immersion, participation in people’s life activities or services of agencies, reflection and processing sessions.</p>
<p>Ideally, the next level is TRANSFORMATION. Transformation happens when there is now the desire for voluntary involvement in people’s struggle. There is a heightened concern for the need of others, especially the underprivileged, a genuine personal transformation, and a natural expansion of one’s involvement to family, locality, parish and country.</p>
