What happened to imeem?? Does anyone know any other sites similar to it?
Apparently imeem is now myspace music, but myspace sucks and I hate it. Since the switch, I lost all the music from my playlists, and myspace doesn't even have half the music imeem used to. Anyone know any other good sites similar to the old imeem?

Thanks a lot! :)
