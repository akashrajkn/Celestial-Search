if i never sold on eBay so how many items can i sell when i open my account the first time?

You can list as many auctions as you like. It takes time to put each auction on, be as descriptive as you can and take your own photographs. Be warned buyers are very wary of purchasing anything from brand new Ebayers with 0% feedback. I certainly would not buy from a brand new Ebayer I'm afraid. 

You have to pay Ebay listing fees and if the item sells Final value fees plus Paypal fees (if you accept paypal) so take this into account when deciding whether to sell an item.
