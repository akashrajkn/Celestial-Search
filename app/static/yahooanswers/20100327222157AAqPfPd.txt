Has Amazon messed up your order?
I had a trip to Florida in a week, and i decided to order a new screen protector for my iphone 3g.  Today, the day before the trip, i received the order, only to find out that they put the ipod touch 2g screen protector instead of the iphone 3g screen protector.  I have checked my receipt and it says I ordered the right one.  So, has Amazon messed up your order?

Nope, never. but, I have only ordered 3 things, so...
