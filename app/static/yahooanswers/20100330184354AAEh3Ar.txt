no way man.....................
You can't just simply "transfer" everything. But, you can copy and paste. Just copy everything you had from your Eblogger acount, and paste it on your dashboard for Tumblr. If it's not working, which it should, just make a new tumblr account. And start brand new. Everything should be there once you copy it. But, Like I said, No, you cannot "transfer" your account. Once you decide to make a Tumblr account, be sure to add me page! Theres a link at the bottom. I give advice anytime:)
