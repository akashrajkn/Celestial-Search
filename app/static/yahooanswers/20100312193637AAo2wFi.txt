New to Twitter, HELP?
i just got a twitter and i have no idea how to use it.
If i want to talk to someone, i have no idea how to do it, could someone please help.

Like, if i saw someone's tweet, and i press reply, will it send it to them or something? 
how to i get in touch with them? besides DM because some people dont have it

if you hit "reply" or just type @username it will appear on their homepage.
