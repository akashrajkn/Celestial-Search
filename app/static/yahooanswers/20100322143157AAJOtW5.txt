Can soda's be sold on ebay?
These would be in glass bottles.   and probably would be sold by 6 packs or by the bottle and these soda's are not homemade and can bought at retail stores.  I was thinking about selling Dublin Texas Doctor Pepper

Sure, most things on ebay are pre-owned copyrighted items. As long as you are not taking credit for its creation I don't think you have anything to worry about.
