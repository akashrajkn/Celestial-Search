Need Cheap Reliable Unlimited Top Cpanel Affordable Web Hosting?
I am looking for cheap, reliable, affordable and unlimited web server hosting service with cPanel. Can anyone recommend me one, please? Thank you.

I suggest you this website http://www.tenhostingreviews.com where you can find a list of the Top 10 Web hosting companies with the best features, support and pricing. You can get everything you need and it's very easy. For what you are asking, I recommend you the option 1, Hope this could help you.
I have tried many web hosts, such as Hostmonster, GoDaddy, JustHost... Many of which I experienced some downtime. In my case, I preferred to pay on a monthly basis rather than paying in advance for a year, or two. Hostmonster, do not allow you to pay monthly unless you ask.

I really needed a good host and I didn't know which one to choose, as there is quite a lot to choose from. A friend told me to use HostGator, I thought I'd try it out and I used that and it is the best by far. I have had it for 9 months now and I haven't experienced downtime yet and they offer everything you asked. Their support is really good and they offer:

    *  - Unlimited Disk Space and Bandwidth
    * - Flexible, Easy to Use Control Panel
    * - Unlimited Sub Domains, FTP Accounts, and Email Accounts
    * - 99.9% Uptime Guarantee
    * - No Contract with a 45 Day Money Back Guarantee

I would strongly recommend using HostGator. They also have a coupon "hgc25" (without quotations) it should give you the first month for a penny. You can find the link to the web hosting in my source.
As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Only $3.95 /month (with discount coupon).

Hey Joann,

If it were me, I'd go with HostGator or Dreamhost if you wanting cheap reliable cpanel hosting.

Both will give you the best support of any hosting company around. Dreamhost is employee owned, so they seem like they truly care about their customers. Hostgator has awsome support. I have accounts with Dreamhost, Godaddy, Hostgator, and BlueHost. Withouth a doubt, of all those Dreamhost and Hostgator by far have been the best.

I have had no downtime on any of my sites and their support is great. Dreamhost also offers a 100% uptime guarantee and they even have a $97 day money back guarantee if you decide you dont like them. That way you can try them out to see if you like them.

I would say Dreamhost is slightly better than Hostgator, but they will both treat you great and offer one on one help in case you run into problems, whereas some of the big companies, ie godaddy are terrible to deal with if you need one on one support with someone that speaks good english, especially if your not tech savy like myself.

When I signed up with dreamhost I used coupon code 65OFFHOSTING and it only cost me about $40 for the entire year of hosting. If you go with hostgator they have other coupons out there, but nothing that will make it that cheap. Heres where I got my coupon codes when I signed up recently as well as reviews on some other hosts if you are wanting other options: http://internethostreviews.com/current-hosting-coupons

Good luck with you decision.
