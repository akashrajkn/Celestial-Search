What do I say on formspring?
I just got a formspring to see what all the hype was about and today I recieved a question that said, "what do you think of (the person's name)?" I don't really like the person but I don't want to say that in public. and I don't want to delete it because I answered a few questions this morning already. What should I say?

say: nothing
Just say
' i wish that I knew (_______) better. He/She seems like an alright person, I just don't know them too well. '
If you don't know the person well, say, "I don't really know them, so I can't say much."
if you do know them, saying "They seem allright" wouldn't hurt.
