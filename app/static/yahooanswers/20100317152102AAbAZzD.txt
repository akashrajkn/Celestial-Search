What is the best IM for webcaming?
What is the best IM application if I want to use webcam with my family back home? I don't need one that connects to a whole bunch of other ones. I just need to know the best one for webcams. Like skype, AIM, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ, etc? I suppose like the fastest frame rate, best graphics, easiest to figure out and connect, etc. Thanks

I use the yahoo messenger.. seems fine to me.. not complicated at all.. ~
i would think skype
Aim, Skype, yahoo messanger, Gmail's webcam chat or MSN
Best is probably Skype i'd say
Skype.  Not only is their quality top of the line but they are the only free provider that seems to allow Macs and PCs to talk to each other.  I placed a link below to a free webcam test site any of your family members (or you) can use anytime to make sure your webcam is working properly, if you're in focus, good lighting, etc.
