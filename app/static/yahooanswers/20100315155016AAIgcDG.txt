I delete the file containing the virus, will my computer still be infected with the virus?
I stored a file from my pen-drive onto my pc even though the usb had a virus...after i was done using the file(which took about a minute)i deleted it and even formatted my usb...will my computer be infected by the virus?

most likely not unless it spread and infected files which is very rare now days
Well it probably is gone but make sure you run a virus scan.
