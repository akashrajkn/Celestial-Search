How do I search multiple Craigslist sites?
I am looking for antique and specialty items and I don't care what location they come from. Anyone know of a good site where I can search multiple sites at once?

Using a search engine.

For example:

Antique dresser site:craigslist.org

put that into your favorite search engine and watch it grab what you are looking for.
