What is the best Internet browser and why?


I say internet explorer because i find it looks the best and its a little bit faster then safari and mozilla.
Google Chrome. 

It's really fast and never freezes on me. 
And when you type in the browser, it has suggestions automatically filled in, even to websites you never visited. It also has spellchecker as you type.

A lot of browsers have these features, but they don't compare with the speed. Try it.

Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are proven to be the two fastest browsers available.  I have Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.  Chrome is a little faster than Firefox, and Explorer is the slowest, but I have a fast computer so there isn't really too much difference (maybe a second or two).
For business:
Flock, it keeps you all up to date. It shows status updates from youtube, twitter, facebook and so on. So it's good for communication. You can also change skins. It's very fast and easy.
For fun:
Safari, its faster than firefox and simple
I'm a scripter/developer so I like Firefox because it has tons of great add-ons for me to use. 

 Although, I use Google Chrome if I'm just browsing. It's sleek, secure, and uses less CPU/Mem than other browsers.
trend in browser usage

IE8 (14.7%)  IE7 (11.0% )  IE6( 9.6%)    Firefox(46.5%)   
Chrome(11.6%)  Safari(3.8) Opera( 2.1%)
                  

i personally use firefox because of security and  addons
