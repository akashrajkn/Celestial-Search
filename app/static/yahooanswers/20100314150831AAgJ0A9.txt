How do you make a Club Penguin Tracker?
I have seen Club Penguin Trackers and I was like what? How do you make a Club Penguin Tracker???

Most trackers don't work...They are just updated for hours..

There is a trainer that allows you to be rockhopper and other famous penguins

There are no trackers. They are manually updated, not automatically, so you can't make any.
