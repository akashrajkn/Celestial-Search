collage website thang?
well, there's a website i used to use to make collages a while ago, but i can't remember what it's called. you can upload pics and use stickers and backgrounds and stuff. if anyone knows the name/address, i would be eternally grateful.

I think picasa.google.com is the easiest free collage making website, but in my personal experience you may be disappointed at the output effects, dull and simple. 

To make better picture collage, you need more advanced and professioanl but still user friendly software. Have a try for http://www.photo-collage-software.com/download.html#173. It provide programs "Photo Collage Studio". Very easy to use with beautiful premade templates and layout and different decorative elements, such as Wordart, stickers, photo frames, stamps, masks & more .

After collage made, you can save them as wallpaper or img(jpg, gif, png) to upload into your Flickr,Facebook,myspace,photobucket...
