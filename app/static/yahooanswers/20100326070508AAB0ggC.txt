Mobile broadband any good?
Hello , could someone tell me whether mobile broadband is any good? 
I mean that you connect something like a USB/dongle into your laptop, how is the speed and service? 
Thanks

See man, there are two types of USB modems.
One, which works with edge network. It will provide you download speeds varying between 10 to 25 kbps. 
The second one works with cdma 3g network, it will provide you a download speed varying between 50 to 200 kbps.

The speed varies according to the time of the day you use it in.
They provide you instant connectivity anywhere, where mobile network is available.
