Where do Fansites get HQ photos from?
About a Month ago I created a Fansite for actress Hayden Panettiere. I have quite alot of HQ photos on my site but I have to get them from other fansites which i feel is cheating really and also this means that my content is never original. I was just wondering where the other fansites get their pictures in the first place. Does anyone know where to get HQ celebrity (Hayden Panettiere) Photos before all the other competing sites? Here is My site ...

Some sites "hire" other companies to photograph and document, often for barter (Service exchange, not monies). It's kind of like the AP getting pix  and info for other newspapers and TV. Some sites may choose to go the expensive route, and hire their own paparazzi crew. 

Yes, stealing pictures from other sites can easily get you into hot water, even if those pix are stolen on the other site. 99% of all the images professionally done on a site are copyrighted by the person who owns the rights to that pic. It is not always the pic snapper either. 

Best advice, if you do not subscribe to a clip art service, do not snap your own pix, etc. - It is best to not post photos. The other option, hire a firm to get your own materials... or get permission by  the author of those pix.
