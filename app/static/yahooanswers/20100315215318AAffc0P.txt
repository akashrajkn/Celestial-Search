What is a good free email service that does not include your name with sent emails?
I'd like an email address where I don't have to give a name to go along with the email address with outgoing mail. For hotmail/msn, it requires a name, and I can use a fake name but I'd rather not pretend my name is something it isn't, instead I'd just like to leave it off altogether. I hope it makes sense what I am looking for.
I don't mind putting a name in when I sign up for the account; however, I want to be able to email someone and not have my real name (or even a fake name) appear in the "sender" field like it usually does with a lot of email services; instead they would just see my email address.

They all ask for your names.
