Why can't I see the pictures on broken picture telephone?
It just shows a little gray box with shapes inside. Do I need to download a new flash player or something?
And by Broken Picture Telephone I mean the website. Brokenpicturetelephone.com. Not my telephone that happens to be broken and take pictures. Lol :p
