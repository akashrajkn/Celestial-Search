Malware Bytes

Malwarebytes http://www.malwarebytes.org is probably the best that I've seen when using a manual scan, but the free version doesn't have real-time protection, but avast http://www.avast.com is also really good, so you can use avast as your main antivirus/spyware protection and if something gets by it, use malwarebytes to get rid of it.

Right now I have Avast! & I really like it.  I had a bunch of issues before I got it & my computer completely crashed, but this seems to be working really well so far.  Plus it was suggested by my step dad who does computer techy stuff for the military, so I assume he'd know what he's talking about =].
