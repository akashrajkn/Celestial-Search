try making a chat website or a website with links. Try using webs.com and create a free one. Thats what i am doing right now! After you make you site sign up for Google adsence and let them put ads on your site, every time they are clicked you get paid(I got $15 in 3 days). Then go to fiverr.com and find someone who will advertise your site for $5, someone posted my ad on twitter and even a online radio show for only $5.  Good luck!!
