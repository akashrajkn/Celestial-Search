Who's had success with chatroulette missed connections?
Has anybody either posted on chatroulette.missedconnections.com and gotten a successful reply, or found someone looking for them on the site?

I've had one person find me with the site, curious to see if anyone else has had luck

That sounds like a terrible idea.

Next thing you know, you will have some dangerous people stalking you.

If you think you're slick and say "Oh, that won't happen to me", well guess again, because it can and will.
