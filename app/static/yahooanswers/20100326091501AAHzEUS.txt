Am am looking for a good pseudonym for registering online for things like forums and competitions?
I am doing in order to protect myself from identity theft and also don't like a lot of people knowing my real name online

Unless you have a rare name, such as Xavier, then just use your first name, especially if it is common, like John or Mike, then append it with a number. For example: Mike1985 or John316 or something...you usually don't have to give your full name for online forums, but if you are entering a sweepstakes on-line, you will likely need to use your legal name, as you would need to be able to endorse the check to cash it (as in the case of a cash prize).
