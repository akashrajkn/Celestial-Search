Is there a way for someone to tell if you go through their internet history?
Just curious, if they delete the page that says they loaded an internet homepage to check it out, can you tell if someone went through your history?
Haha sorry... And thanks... :)

Its not possible.
And this is just answer the main question, the question details are confusing i read it like 10 times.
People can't tell if u went through their history unless u open up one of the things in the history becuz then it will come up on the drop down menu in your internet address box a.k.a. where you type in a website. (unless that person already had it in their drop down menu)
