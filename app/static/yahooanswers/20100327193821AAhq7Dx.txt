Skype
Tinychat? I think its some part of facebook?
I would recommend using Skype.  It's a great way to contact friends who either have webcams or have cameras, and it's free for contacting other computers (phones cost money, as far as I know).  Also, there is a website called Chatroulette, but it will pair you up with a random person, so I would not recommend it for speaking to your friends, only if you want to get a good idea of how screwed up most people on the internet are.
I think you should try 6rounds - http://www.6rounds.com - it's free and you don't need to download anything for it so it's really easy to use.
