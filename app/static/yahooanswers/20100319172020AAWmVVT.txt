What is lifemovesfastdontmissathing.com?
I have heard this phrase, and now i came across this website, http://www.lifemovesfastdontmissathing.com/ 

What is it all about?  all it says is "Life Moves Fast.  Don't Miss a Thing."  I don't get it!  Can anyone explain?

It means that life is short,enjoy it as much as possible.make the best out of you life?
It is about this commercial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1OHlFOee2w  which is a great new phone which lets you run multiple apps at the same time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1abIXPwVBjo  there is a link to a review of the phone.
