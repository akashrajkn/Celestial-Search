I need help on something?
What are those things at the end of some one's comments on blogs or fan sites that is a picture of someone they like from a show and they have writing in? And How do you make one? It is something they put on everything.

Maybe you're referring to the avatar (profile pic) or the signature.
You should be able to do the same by going into the profile settings.
Not sure how to do it as every blog site has some different options or links.

try looking for preferences, edit profiles, my account or any such option/link.
