How do you PERMANENTLY delete your IE Address Bar?
Okay, so it's getting really full and I want to delete it!

I can delete my address bar history, but when whenever I look at the past websites I've visited by pressing on the arrow, they all show up, so OBVIOUSLY something hasn't been deleted and I don't know how to delete it!!!!

Anyways, I hope you can help ;) Btw, don't say to just delete my browsing history because it DOES NOT work ... Remember, I'm using IE

Thanks!! :P

it really depends on your version of ie. Remember clearing browser history isnt the only side. You also need to clear cache/cookies.
