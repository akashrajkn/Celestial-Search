How to get my information off of peek you?
A website called peek you took some information off my myspace profile at some point and is now making it publicly available. Does anyone know how to get my information off of this website? It is quite old information so obviously changing my myspace profile hasn't done anything but I would rather not have it available if possible.

Have you tried emailing/contacting them and requesting them to remove your personal information?  Most web site owners are pretty good about avoiding possible law suits.
