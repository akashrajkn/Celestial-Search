Where can I find this wallpaper?
I had a wallpaper that had the earth in the center with one of the four elements (blue for water, red for fire, green for earth, etc) on each quarter. I know the description is crappy but if you can help, it would be much appreciated.

Try looking for it in

I'll look elsewhere and edit this when if I find it.

probably not what your looking for.
