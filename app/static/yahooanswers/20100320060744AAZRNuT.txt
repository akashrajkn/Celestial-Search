Re-name your index to lower case.

index.html

By default Apache is case sensitive when looking for default locations.
Typical ones that are already included are index.html and index.php, non-capitalized.

If you notice, the link below works.
So, the only problem is the missing lower case index file that your web server is searching for.
Try renaming Index.html to index.html (make the first character lowercase).
Your site won't load at all for me. I'm thinking it's a problem with the domain finding the host correctly. Make sure your nameservers are correct.
