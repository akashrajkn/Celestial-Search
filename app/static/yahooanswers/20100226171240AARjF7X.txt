I cannot load nypost.com but can load all other websites, using firefox and internet explorer?
I cannot load the nypost.com website  but can load all other newspapers and websites.

Neither can I. Very strange. Never had this happen before where only one site is affected.

Fixed it. Had to unplug cable modem.
may be it is blocked by your ISP or .. , try to use some kinds of antifilters (proxies) such as ultrasurf .

you can download it from here (www.ultrasearch.com). The installation and operating instructions
 for using in firefox, is written in its site.

Good Luck
