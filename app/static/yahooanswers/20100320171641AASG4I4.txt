Is it unwise to post your email address on the internet?


Depends on what u use the email address for.  If it's just for pleasure and membership at various websites, then it's fine.  I use my yahoo email address all over the net.  But it has not personal information connected with it.

For business transactions, banking and such I would keep a separate email address that I would not share anywhere on the net.
Depends if you like getting lots of uninteresting mail to read on a regular basis.
