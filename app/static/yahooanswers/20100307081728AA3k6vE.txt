Looking for people on skype?
I'm looking for someone that has and is in Scotland or Ireland so I can pick up and accent. Problem is I don't really know anyone from there. Any suggestions or would anyone like to volunteer to talk to me and my friend?

I would prefer Female as I am one and it would be easier for me to talk to them.

I can speak in both accents with near-native accuracy, if that works. Easiest way for me was to just watch a bunch of movies with Irish/Scottish actors (in Irish/Scottish roles) and practice.
