How safe is 4shared.com music site?
I have downloaded music from various sites on my old computer and it is full of viruses. on my new computer i am hesitant to use these sites but 4shared seems safe. In your experience, is there viruses on 4shared?

no..4shared is totally safe...i have been downloading songs from 4 months from 4shared n none of them had viruses!.........but just remember one thing that some of the songs dont work properly or on ur ipod it comes THIS FILE FORMAT IS NOT SUPPORTED...just delete that one!.....this happens rarely but u should check on it..!...


GOOD LUCK..!!!
