How to know when someone has erased me from their Skype Contacts?
I have a male friend who we used to chat through Skype. At first I used to see his icon shown everytime I connected to Facebook or in the internet even as disconnected, now i don't see his icon anymore. I try and see other contacts as well and I can see theirs.....is it that he erased me without telling me?  How should I know?
And if he's always invisble?

You won't be able to see that person's contact as online on your Skype even if he's online.
