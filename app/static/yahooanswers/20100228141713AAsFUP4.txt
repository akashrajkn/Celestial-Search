help with buying on ebay :)?
can you negotiate a buy now price on ebay, via ebay mail? is this allowed? thanks

YES. click help on ebay and type this in and it will tell you how to do it
Yes, but when you contact the seller ensure they understand you are not looking for an "off ebay" deal, just agree a price and they can re-list it on a BIN, you purchase.
yes you can, you can ask the seller, but they dont usually go for it, there are so many people trying it and sellers are getting a little annoyed by people wanting a buy it now price. 

also if your wanting it to be sent to a diffrent country then the seller is in then they will probably say no.
NO. Ebay is an Auction not a retail company  where you can negotiate.
And contacting them is legal and some will if they have more than one that has not been posted yet.
You may need to read the terms of use, and it explains what you can and can not do.
