Help!! Is there a website that I can upload things to?
One of my other schools had a website in which I can upload files to. Any File. Like Microsoft Word document, A Powerpoint Slideshow, A JPEG picture from Microsoft Paint,...whatever. But now I dont have access to my account there anymore. So...is there another website that I can upload things to and open it up from another computer and download it from there???

One thing is for sure: I know I can do it on email. I can upload a file and then view it from another computer if it has the program to help. (for example: Microsoft Word)

But I dont want to use email. Im going to open up files from a school computer and on the school computer, I dont like logging into my personal things like email.

Try using the website rapidshare.
Yes, if you go to windows.live.com, you can create an account that allows you to upload these files on what's called Skydrive. It's just a way to put up files easily there and move them over to another CP. You just have to make a free account.
do some surfing

Make a new Yahoo account, just use it to store files attached to emails.

Give it a different password than your other accounts.

Then you can log in from anywhere and get your own files back.
Microsoft Skydrive is decent. 

You have to create a Windows Live account

The website you may be thinking of is Office Live Workspace. You can easily upload all of these file types and share them with others. It's simple, check it out here: http://bit.ly/dDk2lg
