Do you think they will ever start charging for the internet?
Do you think they will start charging us to use the internet. I mean charge us when we switch to different pages. Will they charge us because they are running out of domain names?

I doubt it. Many people would reject that. And the number one ingredient to a successful internet is subscribers. No subscribers, no internet.

Although the way the world is going these days... it wouldn't surprise me.
No.  You pay (or whoever owns your connection) for it via monthly charges and that funds the maintenance of the system
they already do!
yeah youre f.u.cking retarded, if anything internet will get cheaper dumb.a.s.s., you probably think they will start charging phone calls for each phone call too right?
It already costs money to access the internet as well as to register a domain name.  So however your connected to the internet makes money as well as the more domain names the more the registrars make money.
