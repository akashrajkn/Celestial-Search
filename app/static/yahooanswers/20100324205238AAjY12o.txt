websites like thepiratebay.org?
Is there one more popular to download torrents?

I'm trying to find something and I can't find it on thepiratebay.org

That's not smart to use torrents because they can contain big virus payloads. Its also illegal, so just don't do it. But if you really want it... check out bit torrent
