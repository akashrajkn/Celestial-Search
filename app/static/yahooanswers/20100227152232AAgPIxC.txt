Could anyone please send me an invitation code for Demonoid?
I would so love to register at demonoid.com because it seems to be the only tracker that has the files that I want but the user registrations are closed. Even though it is said that they would open them again at the beginning of the month nothing happened so I still can't register. :(
I would be very thankful if somone would send me an invitation because it seems to be the only way to become a member. Of course I would keep a positive share ratio. ;)

not gonna happen, people don't want to lose their accts when you screw up
DEMONOID REGISTRATION IS OPEN!! HURRY!
Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you're lucky enough to get in then you'll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don't see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.
