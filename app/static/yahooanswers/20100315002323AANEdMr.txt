My Firefox Spellcheck doesn't work?
I've uninstalled and installed my firefox already.
nvm. you have to add a dictionary.

Yeah, it turns itself on and off. Right Click whatever you want to spell check and you will see if "Spell Check" is turned on or not.

Good Luck
Maybe it's trying to tell you something
