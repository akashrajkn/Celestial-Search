Hi Like,

the name depends on what kind of blog it could be....
If you are looking for technology blog, techatweb.blogspot.com, techiebuddy.bs\xxxx.com,
techatweb.bxxxxx.com, 

if its for travel, travelon.bxxxx.com, travelingon.blogspot.com, and on and on,

tell your kind of blog, so that we can suggest name...
orang pedalaman,,
it's a good name for your blog
