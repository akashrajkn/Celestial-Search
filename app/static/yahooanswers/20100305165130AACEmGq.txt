Tumblr Question Can Anyone Help?
So I just signed up and its asking me to name my blog...I have no idea what I'm doing. 

Can anyone give me any tips on using this site or even suggestions for a name for it?

Name it whatever you want, you can always change it later if you want something else.

If you don't know how to do that, on your dashboard click "Customize" and at the top of the page there should be a silver/white bar click "Info" and type in the title box whatever you choose.

=] I hope that helps.
