Lockerz Fraud Emails?
Ok, so I just found out that making Lockerz emails yourself and inviting them to it just to get PTZ is against the Terms of Use. But i already made like...30-40 yahoo emails from the same computer. And it's pretty obvious they're fake, because the names are like "akjsdgalskdjf" or something similar on all of them, and the zip and pass on the accounts are all the same, and of course i never go on them, so they're not active accounts. I haven't gotten banned or anything yet, but when i redeem my prize is it possible for them to find out that I did this and deny me?

I would assume they have policies and trackers in place to nab folks who try to game the system.
yeah, they can deny you, most likely that they'll just make one of your emails go blank.
i did the same thing! ok so i made aloottt of emails and they sent out this notice that said if u have been cheating then send an email to amnesty@lockerz.com and admit it and we wont delete your account. and i did that i sent the email and they just took the fraud ptz away and gave me another chance. so i suggest doing that or stopping because you wont get anywhere. i made over 300 ptz with fake emails and i got every one taken. i have 3000 now but they are legitimate. it takes time but its worth it belive meee. =]
