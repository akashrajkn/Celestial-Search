Can you view picture messages sent from a phone online?
Can parents view pictures sent from a verzon phone online? Or even just texts for that matter

Officially no, they can not. The wireless bill only shows how many texts and pics were sent/received, and POSSIBLY the phone numbers involved. 

However, on newer smart phones people (including parents) can install spyware, which will transmit all texts and pictures to them, as well as your voice conversations. It's a very VERY new thing though, and only the most despicable person would use such a thing, so I doubt your parents are doing that.
Hi Dman,  Yes  Yes they can
Only if you upload the pics to the online album.  And it'll only show texts sent directly from your Verizon Messaging center online.  Verizon has Usage Controls for an added monthly fee, but it only limits things, it doesn't really allow anyone to monitor specific content.

There are programs that can, though, if they're installed.  Those aren't from Verizon, though, they're from private manufacturers and some aren't exactly legal but the line is somewhat hazy so they're not exactly illegal, either.  They are invasive, to say the least.  Chip went over that already.
