embed flash works in firefox not in IE?
in IE this just pretends its loading forever
also, i got the width and the height to adjust to the window size and its working great (in firefox anyways)
but thats not what im really after, i want the height to be 100% but i want the width to adjust based on either the height of the window or the height of the object. anyone know a trick for that? i cant seem to find a way to do it in SWFobject

IE is not open source and I don't think you can alter the settings.
