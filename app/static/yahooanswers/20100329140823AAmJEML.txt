Why do people do troll the Internet?

Yahoo forum and they ruin perfectly good discussion and a good place how babby are formed and for which such a response by posting. It's maddening .

Can anyone explain why? I do not understand.

Thanks.

They have mental issues I guess. What else could it be? Some of them are just downright sick in the head.
Some people think they are funny, and in some instances they are.
'cause it's hilarious to see people freak out over you. Also, the best is when you do the most obvious troll, and people still fall for it. Trolling some sites is just plain easy, like this one for example.
