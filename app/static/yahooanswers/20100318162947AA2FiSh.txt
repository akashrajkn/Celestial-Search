I have AVG 9.0 Free. Dose it provide good protection? Thanks!

AVG is fine, just make sure to have a spyware protection program installed as well, such as malwarebytes.
Depends upon your browsing habits I suppose!
Get Microsoft Security Essentials. Its good and free.
Everyone is going to have a different opinion about this, but personally I always rely on AVG Free for my virus protection. I've never had any problems with it, neither have I ever had any significant infections on any of my machines (except for one time when an idiot user decided to download some "adult pictures" in an *.exe format........ but don't get me started on that....) 

Just be aware that AVG Free is just an antivirus - it doesn't come with a firewall.
It is reliable, and ive actually used it for a year. (avg)
But to save you time and get less programs get microsoft security essentials.
It also removes viruses already installed in computer and it is a antispyware.
