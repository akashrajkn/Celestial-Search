Try the www.mostfun.com site if you like games.  These come with ads, granted, but they are free (and legal) downloads of premium games.  You can play some of them online, too.

www.cybersalt.org is also a fun place to go see

If you're a recreational reader, go to www.bookmooch.com and look around.  It's a free book exchange site.  You list books you want to give away and are willing to send someone.  Then, you go look at everyone else's lists and pick books they will send you.
You can play online games, listen to music at www.beemp3.com, read books, watch online videos at www.ovguide.com.
