Why does my search engine redirect me to another search engine?
My search engine is picking up the links I am looking for, but when I click on the link I am being redirected to another obscure search engine. This happens however I search - using Yahoo, Google etc. I have cleaned my hard drive until it sparkles using Adaware, Spybot Search and Destroy, Spyware Terminator, Malwarebites, AVG, Kaspersky, AVS and others. When I get into the websites they work fine and the computer is very fast. It just seems to be the search engines.
Any ideas would be much appreciated.

Because the engine sucks?
Hi, 

have you tried scanning in Safe Mode with Malwarebytes? To do that, tap F8 on reboot and select Safe Mode. Try SUPERAntiSpyware too. I also suggest you scan your computer with Auslogics Antivirus in Safe Mode. It's very good.
sorry
