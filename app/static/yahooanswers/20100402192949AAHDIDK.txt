Internet explorer wont work but firefox does ?
When I click on my IE it says page can not be displayed but firefox is working perfectly, Its not blocked by a firewall either. is there a way I can fix this ?
I dont use IE normally... The problem is programs like MSN are connected with IE and wont open either. I dont get it

Why would you even want to use IE? It's full of security holes, and leaves you much less protected than Firefox, heck, most other browsers.

Just stick with Firefox.
Try this : Tools > Internet Options > Advanced.  Click Reset

You have a virus if this is true for all pages.  Make sure you have tried more then a few.
