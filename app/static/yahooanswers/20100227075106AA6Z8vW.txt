Why did my internet turn slow  when the internet connection  icon showed up?
My internet just turned slow yesterday when my Internet Connection Icon showed up and said "Internet is connected" or something like that. I have no viruses and I have over 80% of free space on my computer. Please tell me why its doing this and how to get it back to normal. Thanks for your help.

If your PC is running slow and you want to make it faster, I recommend you to check your pc heath online first, then you can know why it is slow
 and  fix easily..
