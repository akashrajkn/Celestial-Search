eBay problem.. HELP!?
so i bought an item a couple weeks ago on eBay and i still havent even been notified that my item has been shipped yet.. what do i do?

Message the seller.
If he doesn't respond within 48 hours, open a PayPal "Item Not Received" claim
First go to My Ebay and check the item is in your Won list.

If it is then send a message to the seller asking what is happening and say you will wait 48 hours for a reply before starting a resolution report.

Then if you don't get a reply, go to the resolution center and begin the process.
first, is it a large or small seller - a new or longtime seller - in general you will be better communication from longtime sellers. 

Also if they use delivery confirmation and do it via paypal, it should show up under your item where is says "tracking number" in your items won. 

Ebay now requires sellers to put in their terms the number of days handling - I would double check what that was - I always put 3 days, maybe they  put 5 or more?

also I just checked on an item I purchased on Saturday - it is coming from LA - a 100 mile drive - it has not arrived yet - I went and checked and the auction says:
"Please allow up to 14 days for the FREE standard shipping service REGARDLESS your shipping address."

so I assume the free ship comes by pony - 

another issue - if its a BOOK, video game or movie or any thing that will go via media mail, it can take up to 2 weeks. 

you need to ask for the delivery confirmation - if they dont have one, say you dont have one and what happens if it doesnt arrive.
