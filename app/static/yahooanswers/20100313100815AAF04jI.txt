Whats a really good user name?
I'm not really the best at thinking of user names. But there a lot of them that I like, I like user names that are kind of like a play on words. Something like, something retro. Just something really cool and eye-catching. My name is Nolae, if that helps. And I really like k-pop such as; MBLAQ, SHINee, B2ST and Big Bang. It thats helps, too. I really like names that involve love, music or fancy words~

I would use some standard words and avoid numbers. Make sure a regular human and easily say it out loud, just in case you reuse the name for online video gaming.
