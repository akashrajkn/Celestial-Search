I want some info about starting a blog?
I'm thinking about starting a blog, it would kinda be about my life (as boring as it may be) and I was wondering if it's safe to post photos of me and my friends. I would also put my referral link for "Swagbucks.com" on there,how many swagbucks do you estimate i would get? Thanks in advance!

I think it's save if you post pics, but remember that once it's on the internet... it's on there. People can use it and copy it etc. if they want to. So if you really want those pics to stay to yourself you shouldn't put it online... I would ask your friends if it's alright as well. 

Sorry I have no idea what Swagbucks is >.< But good luck with your blog!
