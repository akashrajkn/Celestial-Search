I'm a longstanding Firefox user. How do I stop IE interfering?
While I cannot remove IE form my computer, how can I 'tame' it as it seems to compete with Firefox which I prefer as my browser.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

You can set Firefox as your default program to open all internet/web page related files and such.

To do this go to Start/Default Programs

Click the link that says Set your Default Programs

Then select Firefox, and click where it says Set this program as default

NOTE: That's how to do it on Windows 7. To find that menu on XP or Vista you might have to go into the Control Panel and look around a bit.
Not sure what you mean by "interfering," but if you mean IE gets invoked when you double-click a link in, say, an email, you should be able to fix that by setting FF as your default browser.  Here's how:

In XP:

1. Click the Start->Control Panel menu item.
2. Click Add or Remove Programs (trust me!).
3. In the left pane, click the Set Program Access and Defaults item.
4. Click the listbox arrow on the Custom row.
5. Under Web Browser, select Mozilla Firefox.
6. Click OK.

In Vista:

1. Click the Start->Default Programs menu item.
2. Click the "Set your default programs link".
3. Click Firefox.
4. Click "Set this program as default".
5. Click OK.

Hope that helps.
