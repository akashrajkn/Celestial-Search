I cannot view peoples profiles on Deviantart?
I can get the main website up but not anyones art or profiles, it says there's a problem loading on firefox.

what should I do?
Thank you!

Wait until the problem is fixed, i can not get on mine either. ~
DeviantArt is probably going through some sort of site maintenance-- I cannot get to mine either. (On Windows Internet Explorer OR my Mac's Safari.) When I refresh the page, it gives me the error message, 'Failed to open page'. So obviously they're doing something with the site that is causing it to not respond. Wait a couple hours, the site should be back up and running by then.
