run your anti-virus software to scan for viruses and spyware. do a full system scan.
I would begin by restarting your computer, this will probably fix your problem :)
Clear the serach history and re boot; if this does not work you will have to search for the file and delete it.
first of all u can restart ur PC...
run your anti virus or spyware, next time don't click on pictures or ads you are unsure about
restart the computer or through task manager end the process, but it's best to restart it. and whoever did this has poor spelling skills. it's "you're", not "your".
use your virus cleaner to clean it out and also clean out your browser cookies out.
