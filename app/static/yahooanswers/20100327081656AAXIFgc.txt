Do you like Google better, or Yahoo better?
Personally I remain devote to Google. Yahoo tries to be as awesome, but fails miserably.

I like to use Google as a search engine! It's my favorite. I don't use Yahoo, as a search engine. I like Yahoo Mail better than Gmail though!
Agreed - google is 14134325254 x better
as a search engine, google wins. as a homepage, yahoo no doubt
Google. Yahoo is like the little tryhard kid who goes "Me too! Me too!"
Google and Yahoo both have their pros as well as their cons. Google is an excellent search engine (I use it very often) and has an excellent browser (Google Chrome). As far as email goes, I think yahoo has a better service. Overall, I prefer Google over yahoo any day.
personally,I use yahoo all the time

the only thing i like in google is map 

yahoo have a lot of cool thing in taiwan's mainpage

tw.yahoo.com
For web searches, image searches, and video searches, I like Google more so than Yahoo.  For Email i like both equally.  But what i really like about Yahoo is its news, and its sports section
Google sucks! I use Yahoo all the time.
