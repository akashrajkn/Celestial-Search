when using some1 else's internet connection does your history show on theirs?
w/ a laptop or ipod touch when u use neighbors connection by wifi does your history show on their computer?

No, but they can easily see that you are on via IP addresses. What you're doing is illegal, anyway.
I don't believe so.
i dont think so. and its not illegal to use your neighbors wifi. if they cared they would put a password on it.it would be illegal if there was a password and you hacked it.
The history itself won't show but they can tell what you've been doing.
Well depending if they have that feature on there router. It is possible to save a log of webpages viewerd but not many people do so. Also if you don't have your neighbors permission you should ask them first. 
It is possible to get arrested for this but it's rare.

Heres a possible circumstance: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6958429.stm

Hope this helps!
good Luck!
If you're not smart enough to put a password on your connection, you're probably not smart enough to realize someone is stealing it.
