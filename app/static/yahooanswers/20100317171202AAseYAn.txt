Where can I watch non-virus movies online?
I just went to watch-movies.net and downlod Valentines Day. I hope it's not a virus.

Hulu.com, Itunes, Netflix, etc.

Watch-movies.net is illegal.
Well, how about netflix? You can do a free trial and because it's legal... it's virus free! Though I'm not sure if that movie is there. You could also try some torrent sites f you know how to torrent... just do a virus scan and do NOT run any exe files.

SIDE NOTE: I recommend Avira AntiVir if you want to protect against viruses!

Have fun!
Best site in my opinion:
A lot of new movies are on this site but you can also find all the classics. Also many movies that are now airing in theaters, can be found here. You can watch different TV shows as well on the same website for free. Movies are full length and high quality. You have the option to just watch them or if you want, download them. Hope this helps you! Enjoy!
