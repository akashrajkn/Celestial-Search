How do I add CNN Money RSS to Internet Explorer 8?
I am able to add some other feeds, and i have no problem with firefox, but it doesn't seem obvious on how to add rss feeds in Internet Explorer 8.

Thank you.

Here is a guide of how to add an RSS feed: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/tour/rss/

You should also check out the CNN Toolbar: http://www.ieaddons.com/en/details/news/CNN_Toolbar/

I hope this helps!
