Will a proxy server keep me from getting caught downloading torrents?
I'm trying to find a way to download bitorrent's without getting caught by my internet provider (i've already gotten a pre-lawsuit notice, so i know they are watching me extra close.) will a proxy server hide me completely? or can my internet provider still see what i'm downloading?

idk but telling everyone on yahoo will lol jkjkjk
Download peer guardian.
Everything you do goes through your ISP, and that is where you are being tracked from.  It seems to me you don't give a damn about the law, so go right ahead and steal! We'll see you when you  get out of prison!
Sorta, but no... It will redirect your outside ip address, but if someone was looking for you, and they did what is called a traceroute it would show your actual outside ip address as one of the hops it takes... so no not really :(
Proxy servers leak everything. They are not secure. You would be a fool to do this and risk some multi million dollar lawsuit.
