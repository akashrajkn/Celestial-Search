I have a Tumblr question?
Okay, well I've been reading this girl's tumblr posts for a while now because I think they're interesting, but we don't really know each other and I'd prefer to keep it that way. So, I was wondering if there was a way this girl could find out that I've been looking at here Tumblr account even though I myself don't have one? Can she track me down somehow?

No, you have nothing to worry about.
No, she can't. There is no way for a tumblr user to see who has been on his or her profile.
