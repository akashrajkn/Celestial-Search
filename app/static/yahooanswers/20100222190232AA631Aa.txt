Can you help me choose a domain?
Which URL would be a nice pick for a blog about a teen guys life, aimed towards guys to read.

AnotherDude.com
AnotherBro.com
AnotherGuysEyes.com
DudeSup.com
WutsupDude.com
GuysLifeInaBlog.com
StepThroughLife.com

GuysLifeBlog.com
I would recommend leaving a suicide note, that way nobody else would get in trouble when they find your decomposing corpse.

Picking a domain name just because it sounds good is not the best approach.  Your domain name should be a keyword that will attract traffic or visitors to your site.

You need to do keyword analysis using Google Adword Discovery tool:

https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal

if you want traffic to your domain.

I entered the following:
guys life
step through life
another guys eyes
another dude

And got lots of possibilities.  Go for a name that has less than 100K global searches and is a long tail keyword (a phrase with 3 or more words).

You can also use the free Wordtracker tool:

http://freekeywords.wordtracker.com/.  Just enter a keyword and it will return ideas for you.
