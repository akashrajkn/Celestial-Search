mozilla firefox keeps on freezing?
somtimes when im surfing, the window just goes white (well, the color of the window), and no matter how long i wait or do random stuff (minimize, task manager) nothing works. trust me,  the only option is to close it. how can i fix this? how can i stop it from happening?

give up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer without opening any windows something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible
