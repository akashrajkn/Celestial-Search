Are there any other good auction sites besides ebay?
I'm a big fan of ebay but, I'm just wondering if u may know of other auction sites that aren't as costly to list items for sale? Can u give me a list of some that u know that are good please?

Not sure.  I'd like to find out too.  eBay fees seem to be getting a bit too steep
I really dont think there is i would look on google is my chooice But i know one that Might be for ur area And mite be cheap
Craigslist If there is one there i really dont know 
But heres some i would Suggest to anybody
