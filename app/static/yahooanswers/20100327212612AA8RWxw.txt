Yaar, how expensive is Internet in India? How much kbps for how much rupees?
Hi yaar. I'm going to India. I've lived in another country for sometime. Anyway, how expensive or cheap is Internet connection. I need unlimited monthly charge based connection. I know it can vary but what are some good services for home users? Like what's the price and how much download speed I'll get? Please answer only if you are sure and know some things about this.

Its very cheaper in india as compared to other countries. The best is BSNL broadband. First of all, You should get landline connection from BSNL, then apply for broadband connection.Unlimited connection would cost you 750?- Rs per month. Speed is less , as good as 1mbps. but its better for video watching too. Just visit www.bsnl.co.in
Go to bsnl.co.in it will give you the brodband services .the 750 plan is good for unlimited downloads and the speed is a little bit slow up to 512 kbps.
Tikona Broadband:
best is 600kbps for Rs799 no landline required. Am using it
Yes its a harsh reality that a country which is self proclaimed IT superpower doesn't have inexpensive or affordable internet for majority of its population. But you can get MTNL or BSNL connection. Latest MTNL offer is 512 kbps for 649 Rs. but you can't trust their services like every other govt. service because there is problem of frequent disconnection but ya its still better than private companies' services because they charge you much more for the same access speed and sometimes the actual speed is not provided.
