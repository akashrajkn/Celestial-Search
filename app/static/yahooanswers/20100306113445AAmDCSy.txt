Where can I find a Download for 'The Last Station' Oscar nominated movie?
I'm trying to watch as many 2010 Oscar nominated movies before the Oscars tomorrow and I cannot for the life of me find a download for a real copy of 'The Last Station'. I have tried many torrent sites with no luck.

If anyone knows a working download for it please help me out.

*ALSO if anyone knows where I could watch a streamed version of it That would be great, thanks.

Tudou.com is a good streaming website for download. Try it after a few days. It's not currently there. But, there's some more oscar Nominated movies like An Education, The Hurt Locker... Try it.

You'll have to go to Clipnabber.com to download links to the videos.

Hope it helps.
