I think you are talking about Penny Auctions.  However, it is difficult to win auctions on the popular websites because there are too many users there which results in more people outbidding each other and higher prices.  Try sites like smartbargainhunters.com if you want to increase your odds of winning.  It is only a week old and has fewer users.
