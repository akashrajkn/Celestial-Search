Have u tried Chat roulette?
I have and unless ur super beautiful people will not chat with you, they are rude and it can be fun or so ive been told but so far ive had negative exsperince, has anyone here been on it?

its not cause im ugly, but i wear a mask so its positive for me
yeah its a lot more fun with a group of people or friends, its kinda boring all by yourself, plus like 8 out of ten times its some guys junk.... which can be pretty hilarious. you just have to keep with it and doing it with friends makes it better
Oh yeah, I tried it. I even recorded some of these weirdos and put onto youtube :)

And you don't have to be beautiful, you just need to radiate positive energy so that people want to communicate with you.
