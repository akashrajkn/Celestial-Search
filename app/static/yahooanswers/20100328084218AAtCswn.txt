My brother set my internet to disconnect at a certain time everynight, can someone tell me how to change it ?

How do I change it in the settings?

If your brother is the "master" on your internet then he will have to change it back, if not then you can find it by looking under settings.
You cannot if he set up it in antivirus(eg kaspersky).
Tell your mom.
