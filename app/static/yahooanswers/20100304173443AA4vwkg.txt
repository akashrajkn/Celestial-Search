I need help with my internet?
I have Cricket Broadband.When i first got it i was able to play Xbox Live for about 7 to 8 games before i lagged out. Now about 2 months later, i cant even play 1 game. its so annoying. I have been trying to get speed boosters but none of them run they all have one error code that says " Run time error 380 Invalid property value" I have tried registry programs and everything and none of them work so can someone please tell me some way to boost my cricket broadband speed a lot

I really don't know how to help you.
