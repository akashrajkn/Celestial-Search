Does anyone "normal" use Chatroulette?
After hearing about it on the dailyshow, I went to the website. 10 minutes in and I can't even count how many strange things I saw. Does anyone who isn't freaky use the site, or is it just a bunch of crazies showing their body parts?

Mainly body parts, occasional sanity.

Occasional might be too strong a word...
i use it and im normal, ive met a couple awesome ppl on there
It has been around for quite a while and has built up a large fan base among people who like to "troll" (people that do something that they know others will find offensive with the primary goal of getting strong reactions).  Out of this group of users, I would have to say that at least half of them are using some form of webcam emulation (you are seeing a recorded webcam from someone else, not the actual user).  
This particular group of people wouldn't be interested if they thought there were no normal people to offend.

I would say that 75% of the people are simply trying to get a reaction out of you, and 25% "normal" users just doing it for fun.
