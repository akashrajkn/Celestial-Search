Who is smart enough to help me out here with yahoo explorer?????????????????
Ok i was checking my site and it says i have 7 pages and 71 inlinks.. Last week it said i have 6 pages and 78, why did my inlinks go down and how did i go from 6 to 7 pages?

No such thing! Yahoo! does not make an Internet Browser. Only a Toolbar!
