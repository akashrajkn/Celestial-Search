Is there a music website that I pay a monthly fee and download unlimited music?


Yup.  The Zune Pass is one such website.  Keep in mind that you can only truly own 10 songs a month with the service, so if you cancel the service your music stops working except for the 10 songs you keep.
The safest way is to go to individual websites where they give away music for free. Anytime you deal with websites with a lot of traffic you open yourself up to viruses, spyware, adware, etc. Here is a hip-hop/rap artist's website with free downloads to get you started.
