what is the best (fastest, safeest, i.e.) free internet browser?

i have internet explorer, firefox, chrome, and opera all of them followed the same patteren,
worked  great at first, got really slow

google chrome
Mozilla Firefox is pretty good.
MOZILLA Firefox!!
Fact:
Opera is the worlds fastest browser, if you google the benchmarks you will find out, it uses innovate tab technology listed below and it has a turbo function which will break down images causing pages to load a lot quicker for people with slow internet. 

Google Chrome stands as the only unhacked browser at the hacking conferance pwn2own, one off the best hacker's there had found an exploit within google chrome but cannot exploit it due to innovate sandbox technology. Google this if you don't believe me.


Google Chrome
-Currently the only unhacked web browser, it uses  in-built sandbox technology (there for the safest)

Though Comodo Dragon, has taken this innovative technology and made a fast, and very secure web browser, perhaps even more secure then Google Chrome.

Currently the fastests web browser around is Opera, it is amongst one off the safest, it also uses innovative tab technology meaning each tab uses its own process this will safe you some time incase your web browser crashes within a tab, only that tab will crash ^^

Firefox is said to be the safest with its WOT and Ad-blocker but it is not, and it's pretty damn slow.
There are loads, it depends on the user.
firefox - fast loads of ad ons
chrome - probably faster
avant - fast
opera - different
flock - good for social networking
K-meleon - simple and fast

just a few
firefox...by far...safe and so many USEFULL addons
even better with a couple of tweaks
