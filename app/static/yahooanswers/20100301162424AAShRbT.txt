How can I add a chapter to my story on FanFiction?
I know how to get to the place where you can add them, but it makes me select the document I want to use for Chapter 2, and I don't have it uploaded. Where can I upload it? Help please..
Ahh, how'd I get on UK answers?! -.- Sorry.

After you login, go to the Publish tab, then "Document Manager (Upload)". Browse for the file on your computer and submit it.
