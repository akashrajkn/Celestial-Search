Whats the best Instant Messanger?
I was using MSN but theres a few ppl on there I dont want to talk to anymore so when I log on I need to be appear offline just so i dont get a bunch of messages from them.
Whats a good IM program that isnt a memory hog, has file sharing, im, and voice chatting 
I don't want to have to get a new email address either so I dont want yahoo i want to set it up with my main hotmail acct
I want something thats not a website - like myspace or facebook but something i can use while on a game or surfing or doing homework and stuff
Why would I want a new email, I dont want a bunch of email addresses just to chat.
I dont block them becuase I have to see them IRL & its easier if im not on it then 2 lie, which is y im looking for a new non website based im

Why don't you just block them?

Additional:
Not logging in and blocking them appear the same from their end.
Also, why not tell them that you don't want to talk to them?  
Man up.
Pointless to answer if you arent going to accept creating a new email. You are simply stuck with MSN messenger! Yahoo messenger is the best period.
The only way to get rid of this problem is that you have to make an account on  www.meebo.com  here you can chat with anyone without getting messages from peoples you don't like.
I think Skype is the best one, as it seems more stable and works well for me.

The phone calls you can make are great as well.
