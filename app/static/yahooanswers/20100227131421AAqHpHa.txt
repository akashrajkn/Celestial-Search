Slow internet due to virus?
My internet for the last week or so has been running very slow.
When i first connect to the internet and quickly run a speed test my connect is about 2MB,
But then after about 3mins of being connected its just says on 24kbps :L,
This never used to happen, but i have also started to get A LOT of pops up with news tabs opening randomly to gambling sites or some weird search engines. 
I ran avast computer scan and removed the infected files but it is still running at 24kbps :L.
What can i do?

You should call Norton Internet Security they can tell you what to do or visit finnalyfast.com
You probably need to get rid of some of the temporary internet files, cookies, etc. by using the Disc Cleanup that you access by either clicking START-All Programs-Accessories-System Tools-Disc Cleanup

or

Go to Start-Run-Type in "cleanmgr"
If your PC is running slow and you want to make it faster, I recommend you to check your pc heath online first, then you can know why it is slow
 and  fix easily..
