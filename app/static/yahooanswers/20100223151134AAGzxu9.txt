In Firefox how can you set it up so that it will save only the cookies you want and delete the rest?


Try Tools>Options>Privacy. Set it up to accept or not accept cookies and set exceptions.
Hi there! All you have to do is go to the tools menu at the top, click clear recent history, a window should pop up with a danger sign, click details & highlight everything you want to clear except cookies! :)

Hope this helps!
