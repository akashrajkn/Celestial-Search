Need help speeding up my internet.?
I am using Windows Vista (spare me the Mac fanatic jokes, I preffer XP). I recently used some torrents, and bandwith wasnt being taken up at all. Now that all my torrent software is removed, all downloaded files erased, and Torrant program uninstalled, the internet is running slower than ever.

I use Comcast Cable for internet, phone, and TV, if that makes a different. This is a laptop, not a desktop.... I ran a virus scan that came up clean, ran CCleaner, and Disk Defragmenting and still slow as hell. Visual Effects are at minimum as well. Any ideas?

EDIT: Umm Safari only works good on Macs, on windows, especially Vista, it sucks rats balls, kthxbai, I need people that know what they are talking about, not people that recomend new browsers. No offense, but incompetence is extremely annoying.

If you're internet explorer or whatever up to date? I recommend using the Safari browser. Its sooo fast. It is from apple but you can download it for windows for free. Oh and you shouldn't have more than one window open at a time. That slows down the internet.
i dont kno if it works from personal use but finalyfast.com is suposed to help that from what i hear if tht doesent work you should take it to a computer store and have them fix it it will probobly cost like 20 or 30 bucks or you can get a new router and seeif that helps
