What is a good free e-mail client with few users?
I'm trying to get an email address with just my name, but my name is too common to get one on the big clients (yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc). I hate having numbers in my email address, so does anyone know any sites that offer free e-mail, yet have few enough users that I might be able to get a good email address?

I used inbox.com - they were pretty good.  Not as big as the others but have been around a while...you can try it out.
