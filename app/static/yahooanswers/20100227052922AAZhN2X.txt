HELP!!! How do I WIN something on ebay, when loads of people want it?!?
There is this item i want on ebay. It ends at 2.30 pm today, in just one hour! There are ten bids on it already. Some of the people have a thousand or more stars, i have none at all :(

i really want it. i need to know - how soon before the bid ends can i bid on it? do i just hang around til a minute before it ends, then place my bid, or will this be too late? i need serious tips on how to win it, even when i am pitted against ten people with loads more experience than me! 

thanks so much for your help. i haven't placed a bid yet at all....

Go for weird numbers like ?13.47 because most people go up in even numbers, eg ?13.45, so if they see that their bid isn't high enough they may give up.
You could also try Auction Sniper, that places a bid for you at the very last second.
okaay here we go.. 

before you bid on anything check the description to make sure they havent put somthing like.. 'no one with zero stars to bid'  ..because some people dont like the fact that you might not have any experience on ebay (no offence ment) 

secondly, if the seller hasnt mentioned anything like that then thats fine :D

Now for the bidding, wait till the last minute, make sure you give yourself time to put in your details to place the bid, also make sure you dont put the bid in too early or somone could sneak a bid in.. 

hope that helped a little...   
cross fingers you get the item :) x
Pay the most money. That's generally how auctions work.
Remember that with eBay, no matter how high the maximum bid you enter is, if you win the item, you will only pay the minimum needed to beat the next highest bid. Also remember that no-one can see what your maximum bid is, only the current price.

My strategy is fairly simple. Put in a bid for the maximum I am prepared to pay for the item, and sit back. If I get the item, great, if not, then the price was more than I was prepared to pay anyway.
