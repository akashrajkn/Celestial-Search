What do you think about Chatroulette?
For people who dont know what it is, its a random live video chat.

Its more personable, its like the phone-of-the-future :P
I love it! Hilariously fun!
It's awesome.

Nothing beats anonymously showing my weiner to girls all around the world.

Yay!
it's quite entertaining.. i have to admit. it's going to cause depression though. cause internet people are mean :/ i've seen really young kids on it too, which makes me a bit upset that their innocence is getting lost so young. i feel like there should be better security measures or something, but it's a wonderful concept overall, and i'm hooked. i've met some cool people on it, and it's a cool way to spend some free time.
It is fun to kill a few minutes, but I do not believe it to be some kind of long term useful site.
its not working for me righ tnow?
