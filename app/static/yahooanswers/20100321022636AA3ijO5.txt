No problem, open your favorites folder (C:\Users\YOUNAME\Favorites) and copy its contents. Create another folder on your desktop and copy the favorites inside. Right click thos folder and choose send to.. compressed (zipped) file - email this to a Gmail or email account you have on your laptop, open it and copy it's contents to the same location of the favorites filder. Restart Explorer and that it
It is!
Go to File > Import and Export.
Click Export to a file then next,
Tick favourites or anything else you want exported
Then choose the correct location of where it's going (like in a usb)
Then click export and it should be all done

Yes, open up your IE 8, go to Favorites, click "Add to Favorites". You will then see the option to Export or import Favorites. Choose export and send to a USB Flash Drive.It will copy all your favorites. Then use the USB to import from the USB to your new laptop.

The steps are the same, just use import to copy from your USB.

If you do not have a USB Flash Drive, then just make a note to where you copied the Bookmarks to and then email it to yourself.

Good Luck and Happy and Safe Computing
