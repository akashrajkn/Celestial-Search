Did I lose my money on paypal, What does processing mean..?
I sold something on ebay and the money went straight to paypal. I then pressed withdraw + then add transfer to bank account and it said it was pending for 1 day, and then it finally said completed. So I then checked my internet banking and the money did not show up. So I went to paypal and pressed add funds from bank account so the money went back. It now says processing, Have I lost my money? When will it be there? Pleaseeeeeeeee help I'm so worried I lost my money!!!!!!!!!! :( What does processing mean? It says the money will be in the bank on the 11th, Wow that's long. Has this ever happened to you? ah I'm so stupid!

Processing means it is processing the transfer. A little patience works wonders.

Paypal does not immediately release funds in case there is a dispute.
