The Game the game the game?
I lost the f-ng Game.

I HATE YOU ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS :P 

lol at the guy who thinks its a cd...
congratulations.
i almost lost but thought about something else quick
If you lost a game which originates from a CD for either your computer, then you may be able to find a version of it online through fileshares and/or the original gaming website through their support system.

If you lost a game which originates from a gaming console, then you maybe in deeper trouble.  From the original retailer, you may be able to talk to them and explained what happened.  But this may not lead anywhere.

Your best bet might just be to buy a replacement, as used model for instance.  Try eBay to track one since games aren't too pricey.
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU
