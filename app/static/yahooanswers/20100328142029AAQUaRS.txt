Where is the tamper data on Internet Explorer?
I saw a video were a guy went into the tools section of Firefox and clicked on tamper data. is there such thing on Internet Explorer, because I went to tools and did not find it. If there is explain how to get there, thank you.

tamper data is an addon for firefox. There is, but it needs to be installed.
