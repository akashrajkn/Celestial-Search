For people who have been banned from Lockerz ?
am i banned from lockerz?
i put my correct email and password.
but as soon as i log in it says "you are logged out. please sign in again."
i kept doing this but kept saying that. am i banned?
for people who have been banned from lockerz, how do you 
know you have been banned? does it say youre banned or stuff?
what happens?

I have a similar problem when i log in it says wrong email try again and i think im banned now because i looked it up on Google and most people said they got banned when that happened.I really hope not i have like 1400 ptz if im banned ill be really dissapointed.Good Luck I hope its just site error.
try using a different computer :)
