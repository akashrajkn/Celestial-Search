What is wrong with Firefox?
When I try to open it it says 

"The Procedure entry point js_NextActiveContext could not be located in the dynamic link library js3250.dll"

Something probably got corrupted, so what you'll have to do is uninstall it, and then install it again.

Go to your Control Panels -> Add/Remove Programs (XP)  or  Programs (Vista/7)
Find Firefox, and remove it.
Open Internet Explorer, go to www.getfirefox.com  and download it again, then install Firefox.  All your favorites and sites will still be there once its finished.
uninstall, delete Firefox folder in the Program files, reinstall u should be ok
