What are some interesting email newsletters I should subscribe to?
I am subscribed to the Freshome.com newsletter, and I find it interesting. I think email newsletters are easier than remembering to go to the website every other day. Do you have any good newsletters that are interesting and worthwhile? (FYI: I don't find Holiday's Inn newsletter interesting)

I've always enjoyed the Y Pulse newsletter. I've been getting it for about 2 years. But it's very Gen Y specific and sometimes a bit too young...
