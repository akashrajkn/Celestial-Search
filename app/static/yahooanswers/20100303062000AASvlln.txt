Can you pay for something through Paypal sandbox?


No not with real money...

Paypal Sandbox is used for testing your websites checkout process, in the test environment you would set up a test (fake) buyer and seller account the funds in those accounts are (made up / fake). 

It's just for testing nothing more.

Hope this helps.
