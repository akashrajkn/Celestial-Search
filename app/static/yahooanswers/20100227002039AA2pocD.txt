is it safe to buy  in ebay india ?
hello i am going to buy a mp4 through ebay .

is it safe to buy through ebay

check their feedback!!!!!
it is safe to buy it but you cannot be confident of the quality of the product you get.
many times they are used items put for auction by the owners.
so, they may or may not be working properly.
but you'll surely get the product delivered to your door-step but you cannot rely on the quality.
