is unlimited downloads real in america?
my friend from america says they really have unlimited download limit, i know in england theres an unlimited network but its only for companys.

Australia has unlimited download too if you choose to pay more each month
yes my friend....yes it is
we also have this thing called hamburgers and pizza
Pay top Dollar $$$$ and you can get anything you like
it is real, but there is talking of converting to a similar format found in Australia.  the major internet companies are greedy b*tches.
