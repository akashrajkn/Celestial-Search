Why all the products available on internet (above all downloadable e.books) come with a Money Back Guarantee?
I know a lot of people that buy them and then ask - and get - a full refund.
How do they expect to get money if anybody ask for a refund?

First, if you¡¯re selling a quality product the few people will ask for a refund. Only in the case of being unsatisfied would you ask for a refund so many do not.
Secondly it¡¯s required. Many affiliate companies (like clickbank, paydotcom) require a 60 day money back guarantee if you want to use them as a payment processor.
Third, it¡¯s just good business. If someone is unhappy you should give them their money back and it¡¯s possible that they¡¯ll buy from you again, because you were honest.

Bottom line is, happy customers don¡¯t ask for refunds so, make your customers happy. 
Are there people that will take advantage of generosity? Always, but fortunately they¡¯re in the few.
