I have a friend whose internet is not working well?
He says the only thing he has is skype, but when he enters to internet explorer, none of the pages open. Can someone help him?

call ur internet provider
Maybe he's entering the wrong addresses.  It's not the internet; it's the browser.  It might just be his computer though.
