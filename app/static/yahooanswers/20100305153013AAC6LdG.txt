Does it matter that I spelt my town wrong when ordering a pair of boots online?
I wrote 'Belfat' instead of 'Belfast.' Do you think it will affect the delivering for will they just work out what it is?

As long as you have the correct ZIP Code, they'll get it to the correct post office for delivery.
As long as you used the right postal code it won't matter. Otherwise find the companies number and give them a call.
