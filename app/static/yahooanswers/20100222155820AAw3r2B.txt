Best hosting on the internet?
What do you think is the best hosting service on the internet in terms of having a cheap price, customer support, 99.9% uptime, ..? Do you think JustHost is good?
Mind you, I already tried 000webhost and I think their free version is great, but now that I am switching to paid hosting, I am researching my options.

umm . maybe sitecube.com would be good. its a real good web hosting and has alot of cool templates
I searched the net for long time and the best site for hosting is

I suggest you this website http://www.tenhostingreviews.com where you can find a list of the Top 10 Web hosting companies with the best features, support and pricing. You can get everything you need and it's very easy.  Hope this could help you.
JustHost is one of the better ones.

I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They're also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.
As an experienced webmaster I recommend quickly to build website with hostgator.
