How do I convert my audacity podcast to an mp3 format?
I'm specifically wondering how to do this using the "Lame Encoder," but if you know of another way, I'd appreciate that too! :) Thank you!

lame is not a audio converter, it only lets you export your work as mp3 with audio editing programs that your using
At audacity.sourceforge.net/, on the 'Downloads' page and in the left menu under 'Plug-ins and Libraries' -- you find the 'Lame faq' link, that (finally, WHEW) leads you to the 'Lame Download page'.

Anyway, once you have that saved to your computer, run the program. You only need to do this once, so that Audacity 'knows' where to find the Lame Encoder. 

When saving your entire compilation, be sure export the entire length as mp3-- in comparison to the export selection as mp3 option, in which you click on the exact selection you wish to export (making it a deeper gray color than the other imports). 

Also: When saving the song, and choosing folder options and such, be sure to choose the 'Mp3 File' as the output.
