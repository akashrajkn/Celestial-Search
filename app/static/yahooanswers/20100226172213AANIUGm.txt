Start your own internet company.
i don't think theres an other way for inernet sorry just keep payin
get a wireless receiver and then steal peoples internet that isnt password protected.
If you have internet on your cell phone you can hook it up someway from your cell but I don't know how.
Go to local coffee shops like Starbucks for free internet. If you live in a city or suburb, people around you may have wireless internet routers which you can also use. If no-one lives around you, you probably will have to keep paying that fee.
JUST SEARCH FOR OPEN NETWORK AND THEN YOU CAN FREELOAD OFF OF ANY WIFI NETWORKS THAT ARE CLOSE TO YOU, LOOK IT UP ON YOUTUBE, ALSO WATCH THIS VIDEO ITS A TRICK USING A PIECE OF FOIL TO BOOST YOUR WIFI RECEPTION.
Neighbornet.
1) Use a neighbor's internet that's not password protected. Or don't. It slows down their bandwidth, and it's a breach of etiquette, too.

2) Find cheaper internet. There're sites that find the cheapest internet in your area. I can't think of any off the top of my head, but that's what Google's for. ;)

3) Go to a public place with free internet. Starbucks or other internet cafes usually have this service. Public libraries often do, as well.

4) I guess you could break into your neighbor's house, plug a wire into their ethernet, run it outside, dig a hole underground, run it all the way to your house, and into a router. ;)

5) Start your own ISP company.
Wifi.... they have it at places such as starbucks, McDonalds... & other places.
get verizon internet for 19.99 a month and save 25 dollars pr. month
