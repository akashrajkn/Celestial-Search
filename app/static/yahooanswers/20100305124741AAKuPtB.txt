how do i tweet JLS ( the british boy band ) on twitter?
Iv tried tweeting them on @jlsofficial but it cums up on their page and i dont think it gets to them because i was looking at jedwards comments and they have a fanmail part for their fans. please help xx
and also i cant find a fanmail one for jls :(

Well most people who get their tweets to celebs continuously tweet so you might wanna do that :\ But then it's spamming too so yeah....
you write @jlsofficial then a message. I dont know if they reply to the tweets directly sent to them though, but anyway just keep on sending messages and Im sure they will reply soon :)
