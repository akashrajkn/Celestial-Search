Can anybody reupload this file to rapidshare or hotfile?
I will give 10 points to whoever will upload this file from mediafire to rapidshare or hotfile. I am doing this because I want to play left 4 dead 2 on my mac, but mediafire is blocked in china. it is not big (about 80 mb), so whoever can upload this to hotfile or rapidshare will get 10 pts :D

EDIT: THIS IS NOT PIRACY! THIS IS THE WRAPPER USED TO PLAY L4D2 ON A MAC!

i already own the real game, i just need this wrapper to play.
THANK YOU SO MUCH :D I WILL DEFINATELY GIVE YOU BEST ANSWER ONCE I CAN :D:D UR THE BEST :D:D

I'm really sorry I can't do this at the moment, but I think I've got an idea.
If you have got a collector's account or a premium RS account, go to REMOTE UPLOADS, and add your mediafire link to the list, click on "Add" and it will start downloading and uploading automatically, to leave you a RS link. Then just download the RapidShare link.
Hope it helped.
Here you go
