my myyearbook account was deleted i was wondering if there was any way i could get it back?
people reported me for stupid reasons so i got deleted and i really want my account back is there any way to do it? or do i just have to make a new account?

contact the company look for contact info or make a new account good luck btw
if you were reported for suspicious activity it is gone,if you deleted it yourself it would still be there.my guess is you need to make a new account and obey the rules
