Chat Roulette not working?
This is the first time I've tried to use chat roulette and when it asks me if i want to allow webcams, on the left hand side of the page in a little box, i click allow and firefox shuts down. I've also tried with IE and the same happens. Help anyone?

try the following:
-different web-browsers
-re-install flash player
-disable antispyware, antiamalware, firewall temporarily
