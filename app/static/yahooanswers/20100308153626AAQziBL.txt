how can i stop this annoying thing on internet explorer 8?
its some feature i guess that takes you back to the previous page you are in and its pissing me off because everytime i sign in to lockerz,yahoo, or even look for torrents it just blanks out and goes back i dont want that its getting annoying is there a way to disable it or change it? also try to explain it in proper english you know like i dont want someone saying "o its in eo3p format go to the cgdj8 and remove the wiwa3 "

simple. don't use internet explorer 8. use firefox.
Download Firefox. You won't regret it. ;)
