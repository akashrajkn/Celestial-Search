I sold my 1st item on ebay & received great feedback, do I have to thank the person?
What is the right etiquette as a seller?

Leaving positive feedback for your buyer is thanks enough.
If the buyer's been great leave positive feedback and then send a quick note saying: Thank you for a pleasent transaction.

Just to give them that personal touch when selling the odd occasion, however if you make 200 sales a day on ebay, leaving positive feedback will be fine; since you'll be classed as a business.
