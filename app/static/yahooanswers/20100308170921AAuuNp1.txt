any music downloading websites?
I have a school issued computer so popular sites like beemp3, kazaa, and 4shared are blocked
They have to be free, and I have a school issued computer so popular ones like beemp3 and 4shared and things like that are blocked.

http://www.mp3obsession.com/ is a good music downloading site which shouldn't be blocked.
http://www.cheap-mp3s.net/
With http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ you search more than 80 free, safe, legal music sites (for whole albums, add the word "rapidshare"). That way you can forget about viruses.

Hope this helps. Regards!
