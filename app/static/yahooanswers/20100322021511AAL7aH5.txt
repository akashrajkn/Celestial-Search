is using internet  costly in general?


Not unless you are using it for kiddie porn.
It's an additional monthly bill yes, but if you're regularly using it you can just compare the price you will have to pay if your renting from a computer shop?

If you want to have a internet broad band connection at home from BSNL you will have a bill of around 200/- PM if usage is limited.
