Some good teeth whitening home remedies that work fast?
I have recently found that i cannot use the normal mouthwash and the type that says whitening anywhere on it because an ingredient in it causes my throat to swell. So i was wondering if there are any teeth whitening remedies that i can use or homemade mouthwash seeing as i cant use the storebrands. Please no rude comments, and yes i do brush my teeth 3 times a day 5 min each.

I use sandpaper and can of compressed air.
The lil tooth stubs are pretty white. Works for me.
I use peroxide. Use a small amount and leave in for up to 1 min. It does a great job and it cost so little
don't do it, leave your teeth alone, just brush them once a day with normal tooth paste....also refuse to have filling at dentist....they ruined 4 of my teeth. UK government complained about dentist giving fillings are no necessary.

dont crunch down down on very hard sweets, they can break your teeth
