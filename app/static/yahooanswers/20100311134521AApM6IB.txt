Where are my tabs and address bar for Internet Explorer?
Recently, my address bar and tabs have gone missing.  There is just a  see through line that shows my desktop background.  Where did it go and how can i get it back?

Click ALT
on the Internet Explorer Page
Then something should pop up on the top
Next Click VIEW
and then Click Toolbars

And from there, you can add back your items onto I.E.
IE is horrible, try switching to Firefox, or even try Opera.
You should be able to right click where the toolbar used to be, and then check the boxes that appear.  If that is not the issue, it could be a malware problem.  If that does not fix the problem let me know and we can work from there.

Thanks,
