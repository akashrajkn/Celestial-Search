Polls: Do you like Mozilla Firefox internet browser or Microsoft Internet Explorer?


i like google chrome the best, but out of those 2 : firefox
Mozilla works way better cause i am using it right now and it is great
Firefox hands down.
Mozilla firefox i dont know why but for me i prefer the looks and the features it has...
I like Internet Explorer better than Mozilla Firefox but I like Google Chrome better than them both. (Yes, I know that wasn't one of the options.)  :o)
firefox, ie8 full of viruses and spyware
Google chrome is the best, but Mozilla out of the 2. Mozilla has proven to be faster than internet explorer, yet chrome is the fastest and simplest.
Firefox
Mozilla =)

Saludos.
I use both (different machines) and like both just fine.
