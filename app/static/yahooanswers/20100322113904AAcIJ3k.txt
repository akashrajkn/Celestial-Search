Can You Help Me With Microsoft OfficeLive & Adobe Dreamweaver?
I have been trying for three days...
To figure out how to add another page to my website ( http://bradleyhowington.com )
Okay...

So I am using a Website Template (already created for me.)
I am using Adobe Dreamweaver as my site design software.
And Microsoft OfficeLive is my hosting site. 

My Question is:
When you have the Template opened in Dreamweaver, how do you link your pages/create them to work with OfficeLive? Your "Contact, Blog, Photos, ...etc" pages.

How do you upload another web page?
Say you have your homepage...
How would you upload the "Contact" page to OfficeLive?

I am so sorry if I have confused you with this crap.

To setup your blog you must install wordpress to your web hosting plan. Does your web host support wordpress?

Well to start - get rid of Microsoft Office Live Hosting. 

It is extremely restricted and especially if you are using Dreamweaver because they don't work together well.  

There are so many easier ways to setup exactly what you need.  I would start by buying a hosting server (for great choices http://thehostjudge.com/fullcomparison.html ), then using Dreamweaver alone without Microsoft to create your site. Then work from there with wordpress as your blog.  I hope this helps..let me know if you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer them.
