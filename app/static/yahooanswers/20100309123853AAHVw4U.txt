what is the internet?
i know the general reason for the internet. but still don't understand it. is the internet a cybernetic spider web connecting everyone to each other?

Basically just all the computers connected to each other.  A server is what host websites, but it's also essentially a computer, just not in the normal sense.  So, yes, your guess was right.  It's a bit more complicated than that, but you get the idea.
the interwebs is a big spiderweb that connects all the neckbeards and C.P sharers together
