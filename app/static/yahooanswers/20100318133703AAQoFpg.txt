is 1.5m good enough for wireless laptop and a 360 at the same time?
i have my 360 and a wireless router and a laptop ............is 1.5m good enough to run the 360 and laptop at the same time
to this ozzy dude............if u aint gonna answer the questions, u need to stay away from the computer cuz u r a dummy

Yes but it depends what you're doing with the laptop.  If you're downloading stuff with your laptop at a high speed then you will probably notice lag on the 360.
I recommend you buy an Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter!   ;)
