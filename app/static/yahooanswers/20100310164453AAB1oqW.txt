Mozilla Firefox 3.6 safe to install?
So appearantly I need to 'update' my internet browser..
but my computer is easily prone to viruses even tho I use McAfee(anti-virus program)
to be on the safe zone Im about to install Mozilla Firefox 3.6 since my highschool uses it.

MY QUESTION IS: is this a smart decision? should i continue to install or do you have anyother suggestions?

Yes. its safe as long as you download from the original website.

Its great has a lot of good features .
yes it is safe.  if you don't like it for some reason, also try  Opera
Yes.  Install Firefox 3.6. From what I've read and experienced it is stable and it would be a good idea to update.  It's also faster than Firefox 3.5
