Are there any programs like Snapvine still around?
Something where you can record your voice to a blog, etc. without a microphone?

Thanks in advance :]
Oh, okay, I found this...
http://www.similarsites.com/sites-like/snapvine.com

Now, does anyone know if any of those sites are legitimate and free? I don't really want to be charged ten dollars for each time I do it, and I want it to work. Also, other recommendations still appreciated.

Thanks a lot.

I don't know if it's free, but there's Evoca :)
You could also try Gabcast :)
Maybe ipadio is similar to what you want?
Finally there's Yodio :)

Sorry I couldn't help so much :(
Record without a microphone?  How does one write on paper without ink?  Take pictures without a lense?  Do you mean a place where you can attach premade audio files or maybe even record your voice over the phone?  Or do you mean a thing where you can use a PC voice (not your own)?

How about a webcam that is $5.50?

Then use your new microphone and record yourself, save it as a MP3 file, and attach it to your blog.
