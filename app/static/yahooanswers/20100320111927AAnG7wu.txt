Well, I'm the same way when it comes to computers. TV? Not so much. I've embraced that I just love computers. Working with computers, programming computers, basically (almost) anything and everything computer-related, I love.

If you are still wanting to change your habits. Just find something else to occupy your time. Play games, go outside, talk to friends, etc. Eventually you'll find that you aren't spending near as much time on your computer as you were.
