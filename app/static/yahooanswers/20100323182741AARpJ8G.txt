How can I get a refund from a recovery password resetter?
I purchased a software, Windows Password Recovery Tool, but I don't need it anymore. I emailed them 4 times already saying that I want a refund but they keep saying "Tell us more about your problem, that way we can help you further." And I keep telling them I want a refund, but they keep saying the same thing. It said it on the website that there was a 30-day money back guarantee. Is there anything I can do but to keep emailing them? Thanks.......
I've never used it though, and plus, before I couldn't even use since I forgot my administrator's password, and to download something I need the administrators password. I deleted everything and started all over, so I don't need it anymore.

"Money back guarantee" means if it doesn't work.  It worked.  You got what you paid for.  It's now yours.

Sorry.
Once you've used the product, it belongs to you unless it's defective for some reason. The 30 day money back guarantee is for when the product doesn't work as stated. If you used it and found the password, then it worked for you. You'll have to prove to them that it will not work on your system to do what they claim it will do. Good luck!
