Trouble installing Google Earth?
After downloading the installer from http://earth.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=21955# for a direct installation, I run GoogleEarthWin.exe.  The installation completes and there's a popup thanking me for installing Google Earth.  But then I can't find it anywhere!  

Where is it hiding or wasn't it installed?  Is it not compatible with Windows 7?

Thanks.
Thanks!

It's not in programs, unfortunately.  

That must be the problem.  I've got the 64 bit version.  I assume nothing was installed then and that there is nothing to uninstall?

Did you look in Programs?  Its in there.
From what i have found, it is not possible to have it run on Windows 7 at a 64 bit rate.  You may just have to give them time to make a 64 bit version. you could also e-mail their help.
