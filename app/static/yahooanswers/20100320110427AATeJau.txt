My computer keeps opening new windows to my homepage?
What the hell is wrong with my computer? It just keeps opening new pages (to my homepage) and won't stop!
It doesn't open a window to any porn site or a bullsh*t "reward" site, it just keeps opening to my home page. I have like 30 windows to my home page.

It's more annoying than dangerous, but I still want it to stop

re-boot your comp, and try again..
If the comp keeps doing the same thing, then congratulations you¡¯ve been selected to be the next person to go to a porn site and win a  prize 
your prize is this nasty little bug on your comp that a virus scan may not find
But hey it could be worse..
You could have gotten a ¡°little bug¡± that will nave go away in you
