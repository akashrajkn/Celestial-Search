Firefox Lost my Bookmarks After Altaring something?
The other night i saw my account name was JESS  so i changed it to AMBER and then ever since i did that my bookmarks have cleared out!
does anyone know why they went or if i can get them back
& do you think if i reset my computer to a few days ago that it would come back or not

Thanks
