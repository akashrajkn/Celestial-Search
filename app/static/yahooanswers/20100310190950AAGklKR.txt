what are good websites to sell stuff?
I want to sell my xbox 360 and games and my nikon s60 because I need money by friday the latest. I would do ebay or amazon but there is like a million listings and I need my stuff sold asap. I tried craiglist but no luck. So does anyone know a website where you can sell your stuff safe for good money and quickly?

Ebay is a good website to sell stuff on
Try Google products

Hey guys

I'm working for this new company - http://yardsellr.com/D2s - it's a great place for you to sell all of the clothes and purses and stuff that you don't use anymore! Also, yardsellr is a great place to post unused tickets to sporting events and concerts

This company, "yardsellr" is based off the idea that people are, by nature, buyers and sellers and we want to make those processes as happy as they possibly can be. That's why we are trying to make the experience as easy, quick and efficient as possible.

Whenever something is posted, the item is marketed on your twitter and facebook so that all your friends can see the product and maybe buy it. It is also marketed on our twitter and all over the web (by our fabulous marketing team!)

Check it out here: http://yardsellr.com/D2s

And please feel free to hit me up with any comments, questions or feedback that you might have! 

I hope you love the website as much as we do :)
