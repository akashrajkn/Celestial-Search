Is my website name childish?
So I have been debating over whether or not I should change my website name because I find it rather childish

It's called 'EsmiWorld', my name is Esmi, and the blog is about health, style, diy, and life tips.

I would prefer something more professional, like my full name Esmi Gercia

My readers would most likely be young women, what do you think?

no,its simple and cool
You appear to be young, I wouldn't worry about it!
Yes, quite childish. I suggest you put something more like, EsmiStyle, or EsmiLife or something else.
yea do somthing more professional
well, its not childish at all. Pretty cool if u ask me. Good Luck.  :)

An advice, try not to keep your name on the website.
its not kidish but it may sound that with the world instead try lifebeautybyEsmi.com or somthin
I don't think it sounds childish at all.  If you decide to change it, keep esmi and world in it so people won't get confused.  My suggestion if you want your last name in there would be EsmiGecia'sWorld. Keep it simple and plain.  Also the last name is a great idea if you really want to get your name out there.
It is something that could use "AskEsmi" or "EsmisAdvice".

It sounds more like a "EsmisIdeas" Try EsmiG?

Maybe "WordTo/2/TheWisEsmi" or Word to the wEsmi :D

Is it an advice/suggestion type blog?

Maybe you could brainstorm this with your readers? They could have much better ideas!
