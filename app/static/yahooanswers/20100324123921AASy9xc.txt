Can you specify what type of movies you want suggested to you on netflix?
I gave the True Blood Series of DVDs a five star rating several months ago, now most of my "movies you'll love" suggestions are tv series! I depend on suggestions alot to decide what I want to rent, but I do not want to rent tons of tv episodes, I want movies.

Is there a way to tell netflix to not suggest tv series to me anymore?
