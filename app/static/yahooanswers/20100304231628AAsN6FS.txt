PLZ HELP...! Cannot connect to the internet...!?
Recently i took a new internet connection(TIKONA WI-BRO)...after installing the modem and stuff that guy connected the cable to my pc but he couldn't connect to the internet...

so he tried doing the same on a laptop and it worked perfectly well...

what could possibly be the problem...?

i have firewall uninstalled still i cant do that....

the problem he says is that the modem cannot fetch the IP address or the default gateway...

what do i do to solve this issue...??

Plz help....thank you
the problem is the modem Tikona Nano modem cannot seek the IP address

even though i select the automatic obtain option the IP address that i see is not valid

but it does work well on the laptop

internet options > advanced tab > reset
reinstall the TCP/IP protocal and sett it automaticly obtained the IP
