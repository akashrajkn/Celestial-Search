unlimited internet plans on mobile?
I want to attach my mobile to PC for accessing internet. are there any unlimited plans from mobile service providers in india (new Delhi) so that i can surf internet unlimited by attaching my mobile to PC.
PS i want legal unlimited mobile internet plans

I don't see any unlimited plans, who so ever, mobile service provider companies say this is actually fooling us. After a certain limit each and every company is charging a certain amount. If you are looking for a better speed you should go for AirTel, it allows you a 2 GB free internet access and 30p/50kb after that it's the cheapest in the market. No other provider is doing it so cheap, all of them have some hidden costs. I would recommended  AirTel.
