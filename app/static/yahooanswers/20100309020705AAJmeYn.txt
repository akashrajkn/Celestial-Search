I sell items on EBay and on a local auction site. Most of my items comes from yards sales, flea markets, discount bins at local stores, etc. I sell larger items locally, less shipping charges etc. Most customers will gladly pick up the items. Sometimes I buy items from the local site just to sell on EBay. You can get the same type of information that some people offer for sale just by checking out the Ebay site for free!

I have been scouring the internet and talking to some of my best known business associates, and this is the best I have found.  There is a LOT of money in this system:
