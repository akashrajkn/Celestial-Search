I appear to be banned from a blogging site and know that I did not do anything to warrant it.?
The error message I receive is:

Forbidden
You were denied access because:
Access denied by access control list. 

The number 403 shows up on the bottom tab.  

I checked with my ISP and he went through a few things and a ban was the only other suggestion he could come up with.  I KNOW that I have not done anything to warrant a ban.  Also, I can access it through my BlackBerry so if I was banned, how could that happen?  I'm totally baffled and need some help ASAP.  Thanks!

403 sounds like the HTTP error code for "forbidden" (in other words access denied), so your IP address has probably been banned from the site. If you use a phone over a cellular network to access the site, it will not use the same IP and therefore not be banned.

I would recommend you talking to an administrator or moderator of the site and find out what had happened, and maybe resolve the problem.
the blogging site name would be useful. perhaps attempting to contact the blog admin to look into the issue.
I agree with nasty, more details will help you get better answers.
