how do i get an internet connection in the mountains?
well i can get a connection its kinda hard to get one...
do you know what i need i seen some ppl get one....
i do get cell signal whats 4g cell?signal
i have a wifi connection...no dial up
and i do get a signal on my cell phone

There's always dial-up, but that sucks inordinately. There's always satellite, but that really, really sucks in its own way.

If you can get decent cell reception, then a cellular data plan and USB stick is the way to go. It's not ideal as they'll cap your monthly transfers most of the time, but it's usually the best option in this kind of situation.
Depends on where you are.  You didn't include enough information to help!
If you get a cell phone signal get a 3G or 4G USB adapter and use the cell phone data stream to access the net. Mucho expensive tho.
Dear I love your problem.

I have a suggestion for your Problem. I dont know which kind of Internet Connection you are using that is wireless if this.
then
Take a Long Wire 15 to 20 feet long of Copper which used for CABLE Connection or TV Antina or for Home Wiring called 3/0.29 Insulated Single Wire, Connect a wire PROPERLY Tight with your Wireless Modem ENTENA or its Point after removing its Insulation from one end of the wire, and second end of this wire Connect into a TREE after Removed the TREE SKIN or TIGHT this wire second End with a SCREW  then TIGHTLY insert this screw into TREE, 
Your Modem will pick the Signal and Internet will work Properly,
If you dont have a TREE then Take any Silver Plate which used in the Kitchen Accessories  connect the wire as above mention proceedure.

Thanks
