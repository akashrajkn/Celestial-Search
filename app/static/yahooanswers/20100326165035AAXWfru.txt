This site is all over my facebook wall, what is it? It's being spammed everywhere!

IDK, but I sure hope your not Emily, and if you are, someone out there must really hate you!
Well, It is all spam. you go onto that link, it gives you a personal link you copy and paste like everywhere. And you get to unlock all nude pictures.

hope this helped :D
By the looks of it, it could be a scam to get you to download something potentially legal or harmful to your computer. Report the issue to the Facebook adminstrators

(i'm a guy - but I recognise vindictive and insecure males when I see one)
Somebody must not like "Emily" because they posted these "pics" and wants everybody to know.
