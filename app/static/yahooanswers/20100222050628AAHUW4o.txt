Can you do this on the internet?
I am just wondering if you can find out who a person is by their mobile phone number on the internet?

no u cant...
unless you go on social websites such as facebook or mySpace or Twitter or Bebo
or (ill stop)

Good Luck
i'm shore you can only find out where they are by going to reverse phonebook look up
Yes, U can do this...

but the thing is that u'll need to pay up a little...
there are sites that do these kinds of things....

but many a times the fon is registerd in the name of the father or mother and the kids are using them...
and it really becums difficult to identify who is really using it....

by the way i'll provide u some links below, see if u can get any help:
