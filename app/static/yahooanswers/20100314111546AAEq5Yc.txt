How to deal with people who are indulged in spoiling your image on Internet?
I have a friend whose image has repeatedly been tarnished on internet by a group of people. She has filed a case against them and the issue is in court now. But these people have already uploaded a lot of content on internet against her. Please suggest how to deal with this issue.

Ignore them, just like EVERYONE ELSE IN REAL LIFE.

For the love of Vishnu, people. JUST. IGNORE IT.
what you can only is don't share any image with unknown person even with whom u have been message alot. as u said she's already filed a case against it, but i think it will take more time, we know how they give justice.


Pls Pls Pls don't share your Personal Infos like your cell no. ur adress. and what u suppose personal.
