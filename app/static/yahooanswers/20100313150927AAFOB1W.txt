Erg. D: Youtube stopping working with IE6!?
And I need to download IE8, but when I downloaded it last time it gave me error messages everytime I closed out of the internet. D:  How can I fix this problem.
And I'm not allowed to download anything OTHER than IE8.

Youtube will no longer be supporting IE6, you will need to update to the latest version of IE8, here:
