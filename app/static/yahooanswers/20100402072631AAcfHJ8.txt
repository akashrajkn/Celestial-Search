question about paying on ebay?
i found 3 sweaters i like from the same seller for $49.99 each not including p&p
i offered the seller $120 for the 3 and he accepted. how will i be paying for them at that price if normally when i buy i just go to paypal and click pay for whatever amount it says? ive never bargained like this before so i dunno what im doing now. is there anything i should know before proceeding any further?

If your bid is accepted you should be able to just go and pay like you would normally with paypal if you look in your activity and find the listings. Been a while since I have used eBay but I am pretty sure that is how it works.
