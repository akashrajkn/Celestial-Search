Movie made playable on dvd players?
Not sure if this is the right spot for this but anyway, I have movies that I downloaded off the internet that I'd like to get put on a cd/dvd that will be playable on DVD players.  Is there a SAFE and free site that I can do that on?  The files are .avi, and .wmv.

yes if u run windows go to windows dvd maker but u may need to use freevideocoverter to convert it to mpegII

Standard DVD players read the .Vob format, the files you have now are in AVI format..

I would recommend you download ConvertXtoDVD. Ive been using it, it works just great.

It will automatically convert to DVD format, readable by all standard dvd players, it will then burn automatically to DVD...

it is easy to use, fast and it works perfect for me.. give it a try, you'll love it

1. Download ConvertXtoDVD here:
http://convertxtodvd.burner-software.com

It can convert any video file.. like wmv, mkv, mp4, avi to dvd

2. Add or drag-n-drop as many video files as the DVD can handle

3. Insert blank DVD

4. Click "Convert"

5. Enjoy watching those video files on your home DVD player! =)

It has many other nice features too, for example;
you can create your own DVD menu, and add subtitles
