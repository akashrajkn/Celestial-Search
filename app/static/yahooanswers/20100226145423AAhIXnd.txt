what the fuck is going on with  AIM?
My aim was bugging out so i quit it and tried to sign back on, it keeps saying server connection problem, now it says Invalid screen name or password, but I can't log on to any of my other screen names, and the damn aim help thing on their site isnt even working? wtf?

There's most likely something wrong with the AIM servers. Try later.
I tried different clients to log onto AIM and most of them are telling me "Invalid Screen Name or Password".  Most likely there is currently some issue on AOL's servers.
I'm having the same problem. Wait an hour or two and try again later, I guess.
same thing here, same with many of my friends. aim is probably having some big issues
