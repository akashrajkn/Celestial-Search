internet problems and mozilla firefox problems?
When I try to open my mozilla firefox 3.6, a crash report instantly pops up telling me to quit firefox or restart firefox. I tried both of those options and neither worked. So then I try to open my I Explorer and that wont even pop and that to comes with a error report telling me to send the error to them. How do I fix this?  I scanned my computer and had nothing found

try a system restore back a week or so
Try installing both, Internet Explorer and your Firefox back, with newly downloaded setups. You can always switch your browser to anything else if these 2 still don't work.

Try

Apple Safari - http://www.apple.com/safari/download/
