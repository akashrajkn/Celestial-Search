Best photo web album/gallery site ?
Right now I use Picasa Web albums, bu I want something like Flickr where you can have a link to an automatic slideshow of your pictures. 

Is Flickr the best one to use ?

I don't think that Flickr is the best one for making a gallery, It is still limited in some features.
I use the Wondershare Flash Gallery .It also allow you uploade the slideshow to web,share online,,,
