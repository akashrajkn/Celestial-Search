What does this mean? (buying on internet)?
Subtotal $6.58 Shipping & Handling (United States Postal Service - Priority Mail International) $27.50
thats way too much money just for shipping. damn :( i thought thats what it meant

can you be more specific? are you saying $27.50 is the total plus shipping...but that's impossible if your subtotal is $6.58....that means shipping costs alot more than the price of the item! yikes!!!
The items you bought costs you 6.58 dollars. Your shipping and handling costs (USPS international)  27.50 dollars. 

The amount of money due is 34.08 dollars.
