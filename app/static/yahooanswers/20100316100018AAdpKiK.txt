Bebo Skins Help please?
I make the skins and upload the graphics edit style sheets etc.
But when i put the skins module on my bebo page no skins appear in the box, and when i search using the tags i created for my skins they don't appear?
Ive made 3 skins so far but no one can use them :(

Did you go to use skin and click "featured"? If you did its being reviewed by staff that control bebo to see if its appropriate that's why they don't appear when you search for it.....but you'll be waiting a while and just so you know for like every 500 skins maybe 5 will be accepted...why its not in your module I dont know....sorry.  :(
