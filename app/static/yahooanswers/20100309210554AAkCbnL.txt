Whats a Great Internet Router to buy?
One that has a great price and is perfectly affordable. I am planning on buying it from Best Buy, but there are so many brands. Linkys and Netgear, but which kind of router is good for my Windows 7 Home Premium laptop. It's Intel Core, and SureWest provides me the DSL internet. I love the internet on my desktop, and want the same speed for my laptop. So any recommendations? please tell which one and how much it may cost. Understand that i am just a high school student who works for his own money.

You want a wireless-N router. There is actually one for 30 bucks, an Airlink 101 AR670W. See amazon link below. It's the one I use and I've never had any problems, my router is upstairs and the downstairs computer's internet is as fast as the one directly connected to the router.
