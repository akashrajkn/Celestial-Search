Personally I use Host Gator and have been very happy with them.  Their customer service is great and they have live online chat so if you don't feel like talking on the phone you can just chat online with them about whatever problem your having.  And I think their prices are very fair for what you get.  They have different plans to choose from.  And they're upfront about things other hosting companies aren't like inode limits and such.
Try a web hosting review site like www.bestwebhostingcompanies-deals.com

Hope this helps.

Hey, I have been using Justhost for over a year now and have found it one of the best I have used. They seem to always have the best deals for the money. 

The deals they do include unlimited storage and bandwidth, and the prices are some of the best I have seen. The best for them are at http://tinyurl.com/justhostdeals

Have a good one
