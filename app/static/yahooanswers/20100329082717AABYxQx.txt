Club Penguin question?
So in club penguin i am new but it says this below my penguin P and then some numbers. Will that ever change to my real username? or will it stay like that

Thats really strange. 
It should be your username.
It should always say your name.  Since you're new it may adjust.
If your user name is decided to be inappropriate by the Club Penguin Team, then your penguin name will remain being the P With the numbers after it. Since it takes them a while to review and they decide your user name is appropriate, it should change to your original user name that you typed in when creating this account in a few days.
~Hope this helped!
