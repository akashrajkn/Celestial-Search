Do you have to pay to use amazon.com? To buy, not to sell.?
What about ebay?
Please answer!!!!

You pay for the item you buy.
no! not at all to buy on either and not to sell on ebay either!
no not to buy
ebay not to buy but if you sell they get a cut
No. You just pay for what you want to buy, plus shipping of course. All you need is to set up an account.

On Ebay its exactly the same.

But IF in the future u ever wanted to sell something, it does cost for Ebay. They charge you for the listing and a percentage for what your item sold for. For amazon, ive never sold anything from them so i dont know. I wanna say they do charge, but im not for sure on that. 

Hope this helps.
