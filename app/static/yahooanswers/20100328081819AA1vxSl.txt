Can I work as Network Administrator OR System Administrator with only CCNA and MCSE as qualifications?
Are the above certifications enough or must I necessary include others according to you?

Not enough. Nowadays, you must also have RHCE besides CCNA, A+ & MCSE to be a REAL network administrator.
What is your experience level? Certifications aren't going to just give you a job, but they are necessary to have. 

If you're MCSE, you probably already have A+ (or at least you should).
You can ask in the Microsoft Born To Learn blogs what other Microsoft certified professionals have needed to get jobs: http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/forums/f/default.aspx
