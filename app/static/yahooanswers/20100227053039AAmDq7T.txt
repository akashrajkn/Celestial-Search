Where and how can I create a live stream to talk to people like on youtube?
The YouTube Streams were retired and I need a new stream somewhere which is like youtube so that I can talk to my youtube friends. Please help us.
We need to be able to play youtube videos to each other and talk to each other.

Ustream.tv is one of the most popular places to do this. It works quite well.
Stickam.com i dont know if you have to purchase anything but i figured it out last night cause i watch FridayNightCranks every friday night LIVE on this website
