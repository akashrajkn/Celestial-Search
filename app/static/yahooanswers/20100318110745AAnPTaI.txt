same with me been havin one for like 4 years and never heard of a mystery fish : ( sorry i wish i could help but ik alot about millsberry though so I can answer alot of q's probably : )
i've never heard of the mystery fish, but that sounds pretty cool. so what i would do, i would use different baits,different poles, in different areas. use combinations
