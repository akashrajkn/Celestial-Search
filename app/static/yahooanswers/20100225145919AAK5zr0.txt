How to protect pendrive from virus?
hai,
i need to know how to install anti-virus in flash pendrive to protect from the virus and how to make disable auto-play or auto-run in our pc?

well. there are things like clamav portable but you can't have real time protection installed on your jump drive. 
you just will have to scan in manually from your computer.

I, myself manage this kind of problems by using the antivirus that I have previously installed in my pc.
When I know that my pen drive may be potentially infected, I'd format it so as to make sure that there are no files within it.
