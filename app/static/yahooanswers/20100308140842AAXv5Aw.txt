Has anyone sold a domain name on the Internet?
Has anyone sold a domain name on the internet? Which auction service did you use and how did you know how to put a price on it? Any tips would be great! 
Thanks :)

I buy and sell domains all the time. 
I estimate the prices my self.
I could estimate for you if you wish. Message me your list.
I dont use any auctions but i post my domains for sale on my DOMAIN BLOG at http://capocorporation.com/domainblog/ if you wish i could give you a user name for this blog so you could add your domains here. this way you and I see our domains seen by more people..

If interested message me.

Good luck!
