Does this website really give you a free laptop?
I keep getting emails from this website telling me they want to give me a free laptop but i never fill out the website cuz i don't think they are gonna give me a free laptop! http://track.tester-rewards.com/CpaWallPage.aspx?g=447f83b9f08f426d992264a490f40656 thats the link from the emails i keep getting!

No KEEP AWAY probably s scam. They just want your credit card number to charge it. Be careful.
no!
scroll down and click on the unsubscribe link and they will remove you within 10 days! if they dont, you can sue them! MONEY!
most likely that's a scam, along with any other website that says they'll give you a free laptop, it's just too good to be true!
