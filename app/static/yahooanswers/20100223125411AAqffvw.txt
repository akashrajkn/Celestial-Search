how to bring back text you typed?
i typed a huge resume and then i accidentally refreshed the page, i was on google chrome and the resume was deleted. the website was boyersfood.com. Is there any program or way to bring back that text i typed about 1 hour ago??

No.  If information is not saved then the data is lost forever.

The information was stored in your computers RAM.

RAM = Random Access Memory.
It is volatile memory that holds temporary data.
It allows your computer to run.

You cannot bring it back, it's gone forever. 

In the future, compose your large text files in Word or NotePad or other word processor, then use copy & paste to insert it
