Does the Lockerz Z List double preexisting points?
So I just got started on lockerz and I've massed 114 points so far. I found out that there is one "redemption" day for the site each month, but I haven't made the z list yet. I was wondering whether making the z list would double the points you already have?

no. I wish though :P I would have 2 ipods by now if that happened lol
No, it just doubles the amount of points you get later on. For example, if you earned 2 ptz for watching a video, if you're on the Z-List, you would get 4 ptz instead.
