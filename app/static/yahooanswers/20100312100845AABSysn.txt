how can i download PICASA VIDEOS ?
MY UNCLE HAS PUT THEM ON PICASA..I WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT VIDEO??

WHAT SHOULD I DO??

PLEASE HELP ME

Install  "downloadhelper" extension  in firefox then you can download any video form any webpage.

When we play the video online the logo "downloadhelper" starts to swing meaning its ready click in its drop down button and you are good to download.

Cheers
