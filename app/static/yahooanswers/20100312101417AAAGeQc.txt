Buzz
theres twitter . I also heard of a new one i think its blogspot or something. I dont personally like it but twitters fun :P
Twitter
twitter is pretty popular

theres bebo but pretty much no one has that anymore

so facebook, myspace and twitter are three big ones so not many other people you know would have the other ones so dont bother with them
Orkut, Hi5, LinkedIn , Bebo, Bigadda, Blogster,Friendster , Itsmy, MyLife
