In DeviantArts, how do you block a member from sending comments to your profile?
If anyone is kind enough, I want this member 'thecamilanunez' banned. She's stealing my artwork, leaving spamful comments on my profile and trying to give me stories that I think are ridiculous and won't stop. I tried reporting he deviations, but nothing keeps happening. I want that member permanently banned.

You click on 'More' on the right next to collections. Click on the 'Account Tools', then 'Edit Settings'. And in the general section at the bottom of the page, there should be a box that says 'Blocked Users'. :)

Although, you could have went to http://help.deviantart.com/96/.

Also, you can't ban a user yourself. If you report the stolen artwork, the DA admins will eventually ban 'thecamilanunez'. 

Good luck. :)
