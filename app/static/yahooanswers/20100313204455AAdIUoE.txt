How do I Direct Message (DM) people on Twitter through my CELL PHONE?
I want to know how.

If anyone could show me a link to a step-by-step procedure online, that would help but I want to see a video of how to do it. That would be great.

Thanks :D

get a app for this on GetJar.

If you follow a person and they follow you DMs can be sent. Simply start your mesage with: d @name whatever to the shortcode for your country (40404 is USA)
