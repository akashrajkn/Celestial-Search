Is this a legit seller for me to buy this game?

It looked a little suspicious. Opinions.

I'm not sure but amazon is usually ok
yeah maybe the used ones probably don't work or have crazy scratches on 'em, safest is to pay through paypal I know for ebay if the product is not what is described they refund your money or give u another one no extra charge. its called buyer protection doesn't look like amazon has it.
