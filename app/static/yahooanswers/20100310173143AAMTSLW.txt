iamwired.net redirect for any website. how do i get it to go away?
the only thing that i can think of that would cause this would be a download, but the only thing that was downloaded was a chacha toolbar, but, i undownloaded this and it still redirects any page i go to to that website.  any kind of help would be appreciated. also there could be something else downloaded that i am unaware of but i do not know

You've been hit by adware.

First place to check is your HOSTS file:
Notepad > Open > %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\etc

The only entry should be the one with 'localhost' (unless you have SpyBot, which also adds 'immunization' entries here).

If you can download and run SpyBot, it can help clean up other bad Internet settings:
