netbooks with built in 3g?
I know you can get netbooks with built in 3g.... 

But do you have to take out a contract for this? 

If so would something like 500mb be another for a bit of gmail nd google docks (1 hour per day)

Netbooks are pieces of crap. A 3G phone is faster and more usable. You shouldn't get one at all. You can spend less money on a phone that works just as well, or better, or you can just get a laptop for 500.
HP Compaq Airlife 100 is having built in 3g. I have one. I am very much happy with that.
