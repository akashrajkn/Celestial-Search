How do you get that add-on in firefox that "shuffles"  and goes to a different website?
I got firefox and my friend had it before and she had this thing at the top that said a word that made it go to a random website. Ithink it started w/ d... also how do you get the like/dislike button?

I'm pretty sure this is what you are talking about: http://www.stumbleupon.com/ .  Here is a direct link to the add-on installation (click on Accept on the pop-up/dialog/toolbar that comes up): http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbleupon.xpi .
I love Stumbleupon...
but if it started with a d, it's probably de.lic.ious
