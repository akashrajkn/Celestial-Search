what is twitter? thanks?
is that like facebook?

its a place to stalk celebrities.
Twitter feels like coffee after the service at church where many people are gathered but the conversation is often passing and brief. Don't get me wrong, I have taken many of those brief conversations on Twitter offline and have formed incredible relationships.
no. It's a mini blogging site where you write up to 140 characters about what you're doing/feeling that very second and people for some reason subscribe to it.
Its a stupid place for twits.
