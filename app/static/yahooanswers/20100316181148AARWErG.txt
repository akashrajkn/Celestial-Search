Bnftuhtr, the bbshoe website man?
Bnftuhtr often answers questions telling people to visit bbshoe.com

I don't want to go there as I don't want to get a mad virus or malware, but am now hugely intrigued, it's become a kind of forbidden fruit to me. Will someone please go there & report back, i doubt you'd get a virus but who can tell... Thanks.

I went there and I don't think I got a virus... but it was kind of weird. I don't think that this site will be very helpful. It has links to like handbags and stuff. If this is what you are looking for then it is probably safe, but I don't know.
I just went to that site, it's a parked page. It's not a real website, just ads. The owner makes money when people click on the ads. Looks like it's parked with Google Parking for Domains. If that's the guy's website and he's spamming on here, he's stupid because eventually they will catch him and won't pay him and make take legal action because spamming is against their terms of service. I make money from parking domains, but I don't spam to get traffic there. You aren't allowed to advertise parked domains.
