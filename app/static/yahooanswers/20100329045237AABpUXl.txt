are there any decent ad blockers for internet explorer?
when i first signed up for an account in late 2006 on yahoo answers, i dont remember ' ever ' seeing any intrusive, distracting advertisements - over the last year or so it seems now they are a fixed , permanent feature.

i find them distracting and annoying at best . i despise them.

ive managed to block them on google chrome useing an ad block, ive also blocked them on firefox , but there are tons of ad ons on firefox it keeps freezing and doesn't operate too well.

but i notice the ads are still showing on internet explorer , i thought i blocked them with a host file, blocker - but the ads are still managing to show through..


is there any effective way i can block the ads through internet explorer ?

i really dont like them, i resent their presence and they ruin my enjoyment of yahoo answers.

yahoo survives on adds, you can have pop up blocker etc on and you still get them, want no adds on yahoo, they start charging for accounts? Not IE
I don't use Internet Explorer for it's lack of protection and abilities in this department. I would suggest changing browsers before trying ad ons for that with IE. Try Firefox and then install the add-on called NoScript. It gives you the ability to allow or block anything on the page you are looking at. I been using it for years and swear by it.

not an add-on but as a background working software "Ad Muncher" is really successful with "munching" ads and stuff. it doesn't matter which browser you are using. it is not free but i say give it a try ;)
