How can I find his blog from his email address ?
I liked this guy, I met on a forum, and got his email address, then googled it, so got a search telling me that he has a blog, but I couldn't ever find it. How can I find it ?
i don't want to email him, as he doesn't know I like him.. I feel deeply in love, which I know could be silly!

You could email the guy and ask him.
He didn't mention it in his forum profile?

Maybe he *used* to have a blog and took it down.  If it shows up in a Google search, try reading a cached version of it.
