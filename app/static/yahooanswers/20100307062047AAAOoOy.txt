Cant enter Zwinktopia on Zwinky?
Everytime i try to get on it just keeps loading -___- i know its not Zwinky bc it works fine in my desktop, anyway you can fix thiss?

I had this same problem before.
Here's what you can do:

1.) Open Internet Explorer and click on the "Tools" menu. 
2.) In the "Tools" menu, click on "Internet Options". 
3.) The Internet Options pop-up window appears. 
4.) Under the General Tab select the "Delete Cookies" button. 
5.) Delete cookies by clicking "OK".

When I had this problem I did these steps to delete my cookies and it was fixed entirely.

After you delete the cookies sign out of zwinky and close the window. After they are deleted you can sign back in. It should be fixed.
