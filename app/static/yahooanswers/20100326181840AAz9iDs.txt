Is it considered trolling if you argue with them rationally?
where "them" = any blogger whose blog you're commenting

Not at all. Trolling is basically nonsense people post just to be annoying for the sake of humour, but if you have a valid argument and are polite in getting your point across, it's not trolling.
What's rational about arguing?
They may still call you on it, but as long as your not being a dumb sh*t then go for it.
