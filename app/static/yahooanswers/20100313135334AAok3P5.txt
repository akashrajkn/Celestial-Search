Is it rude to ask for a lower offer on ebay?
I found someone I have been looking for a long time, but the price is really high.

It's not rude, but they probably won't give it to you. Just message the seller and give an offer.
Instead of being straight and asking for a lower offer, email them and try and make em a deal.
Example. 
Item worth 200 dollars
dont want to spend 200 bucks will spend 150 though
"I'll buy your item for 150 immediately, deal?"
Or something similar.
no its not rude at all. you are saying its a high price . that would make the person who is selling the object sad that people think its a high price. he should then reduce the price
I don't think that's how it works.
