Where is the best place I can find free, royalty free music?
I want to use some music in a few YouTube clips, but of course I can't go using popular music as it just flags up and it becomes a copyright infringement. Since this is a hobby I don't want to plan on paying for any music and I remember someone sent me a link a while ago to site with lots of free music that was allowed to be used freely. Neither us can remember what it is.

So yeah, free and also free to use music to download is what I need. Anyone got any ideas?

Those are two that you can use in YouTube videos. However, although they are "royalty free", you do have to CREDIT the artist. Check how to do this on the website that you take the music from. For both of the website's that I have linked to, a message in the sidebar is appropriate. Just make sure you include the requried information; for example, the artists name and a link to their website.
You might try Bear Share. It's a P2P music sharing source. You can download anything listed as "free" onto your hard drive and use it as you like. The only downside to Bear Share is that it is set to run in the background and begin at start up. You can however disable that feature once you've downloaded it.
