I need a good media player for website!?
Okay so I recently bought a domain and am hosting it this week. It is a website used for a home filming company called Konnection Films and what I am looking for is a nice media player that I can use for my videos. I don't want Youtube crap I am looking for something like Hulu, or Crackle. I want a darker skin with user friendly settings. Preferably if I can get the source of hulu's media player to play on my website that would be the best. Hopefully you get the right idea of what I want. Hope for responds! Thanks!

Konnection Films, Facebook us!

Good media players are:

jwplayer
proplayer

the above store the video files on the server, and need to be installed on the server.

a google search will give you more options

if you aren't interested in using up the bandwidth of your server you can use an external host like megavideo, veoh, google video, etc.

if your patient you can wait for html 5 to be implemented and then you won't need a player.
Personally, I use Moyea Web Player to stream video on my website. 
Moyea Web Player ( http://www.playerdiy.com/ ) is a quick solution to add flash video ( FLV ) to website and an easy-to-use Web FLV player creator, with which, creating custom FLV player (flash video player) with scrollable thumbnail playlist for website only needs a few mouse-clicks. And the skin of the generated web player can be easily customized.

This is an example for easily customizing the flash video player -
