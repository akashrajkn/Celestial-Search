How many times.........?
Ok, well I just want to ask what do I use as a fake address, fake email, fake number and all that for surveys so i can watch a movie online for free? I don't trust giving out my information like that. So how can I give out fake stuff and it not actually be someone's information? Help please?

Use your imagination
The answer would be... create a fake email... fake number..... fake addres....
For more information refer to your yellow pages and flip to some jerk in the M section under public listing or grab a business like a hair salon place... cmon you can figure this stuff out.... i really want to cry right now
First, never give a phone # or street address or actual birthDAY. I always just use the 1st, then my real mo. & yr.(easy to remember) Use the # 100 and one street over for your address. (again, easy to remember). same town & zip though. Say you don,t have a phone. And lastly, slightly misspell your last name, like use a Y instead of an I, or add "son" or "ski" to the end. An example: change "Jane Barns" to "Jayne Barnski" You get the idea. Just keep it close to the truth so it's easy to remember. I usu a blank journal I got for $3 at Dollar General.  You see, these sites aren't secure. Too easy to hack. You're being smart.
