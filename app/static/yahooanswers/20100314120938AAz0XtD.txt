shipping cost on a 6'+ statue?
i have a star wars statue from when i was younger and I'm looking to put it on eBay and i was wondering how much the shipping cost on this would be its about 6 foot tall maybe a little taller you can kind of take it apart into two or three pieces (i don't remember which)

Take it to your local packaging/mailbox store they could quote you very easily.
It usually goes by the weight, but I would go to UPS and find out more.
