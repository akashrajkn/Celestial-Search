Is there a web hosting company that will allow you to pay per month instead of a year at a time?
Also it would be a plus if they had free domain registration as well but that is not required.

Yes you can, I suggest you this website http://www.tenhostingreviews.com where you can find a list of the Top 10 Web hosting companies with the best features, support and pricing
http://www.goldpuma.com

They accept monthgly payments.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend Goldpuma which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Hope this helps.
HostGator or Dreamhost definately. Both will let you pay month to month if you want. If you go with Dreamhost use code SAVEMONTHLY and it will knock $40 off a montly hosting package.

Dreamhost is employee owned, so they seem like they truly care about thier customers. Hostgator has awsome support. I have accounts with Dreamhost, Godaddy, Hostgator, and Justhost. Withouth a doubt, of all those Dreamhost and Hostgator by far have been the best.

I have had no downtime on any of my sites and thier support is great. Dreamhost also offers a 100% uptime guarantee and they even have a $97 day money back guarantee if you decide you dont like them. That way you can try them out to see if you like them.

I would say Dreamhost is slightly better than Hostgator, but they will both treat you great and offer one on one help in case you run into problems, whereas some of the big companies, ie godaddy are terrible to deal with if you need one on one support with someone that speaks good english, especially if your not tech savy.

Here are some Dreamhost coupon codes in case you decide to try them:

SAVEMONTHLY ($40 off Monthly Hosting)
20OFFHOSTING ($20 Off Hosting Package)
2DOMFREE (2 Additional Free Domain Names with Signup)
1IPFORFREE (Get 1 Free Lifetime Unique IP)
65OFFHOSTING ($65 Off 1 Year Hosting Package)

Here are some coupons for Hostgator:

SNOWMAN (20% off)
BOSTON (25$ off)
HOUSTON ($25 off)
HGC25 ($9.94 off new hosting)

Good luck!
host gator will allow you to pay month by month.  see a review of host gator here - http://www.website-hosting-reviews.net/host-gator.html
There are some hosting sites that charge you monthly (like Hostgator) but they¡¯re usually a lot more expensive that way so it¡¯s not really worth it. For example Hostgator charges $9.95/month + $15.00 for a domain name, so for like $45.00 you get 3 months of hosting. For that price you might as well get a full year of hosting (including a domain name).
A lot of hosts are willing to offer a huge discount in order to attract new customers.

I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They¡¯re also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.

They include a free point & click online site builder so you can create a website without any programming (easily, just by drag and drop).

They also have a great custom control panel with OneClick installs of all the popular software like Wordpress, Joomla, Forums, Chat, Galleries, Online stores and a lot more.
Try FatCow. FatCow is one of the finest website hosting available over the internet. There are many but to choose the best is not easy. Just checked with Webhostingbreak and found their services very reliable. For the past many months, I'm using their services. Very much amazing, how quickly they resolve any issues. The web hosting servers are very fast. http://p.gs/f3g3r
I suggest to you TexasDataHost
http://www.texasdatahost.co.cc

It has everything you look for in a web host and has low monthly payments.
Hostgator allows monthly payment. You can learn how to get the first month free at http://www.cpanelwebsitehosting.com - they do not have free domain but since you can save in your first month, why not get a domain elsewhere at cheaper price from one of the best domain registrars.

Good luck.
