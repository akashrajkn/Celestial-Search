How do I get my chat log back if I've "cleared" it on Chatroulette?
If I've set it  to "clear chat" when I start, can I recover what was cleared?

Nope. Your angry insults to that guy with his pecker out are gone forever.
I don't think you can do it on chatroullete but you can on nastyspace.com which is even cooler!
Yeah I like nastyspace but I also like http://www.randomcams.us
