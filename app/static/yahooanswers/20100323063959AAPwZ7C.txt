Help about tabs in Firefox 3.6?
I have just installed the latest Firefox, however, I don't like how when you are on a 'middle tab' and you open a new link, a new tab opens next to the tab you are on. I preferred it when the new tab was opened as the last tab!

I've gone on to Tools, Options, and Tabs, but there is no setting there for me to change this. Is there any was I CAN change this?!

Tools > Options > Tabs > Tick open new windows in a new tab instead.

Hope this helps!
You have to change the code

in the url bar type about:config
click "I'll be careful"
go to browser.tabs.insertrelatedaftercurrent
double click it to false

This will make new tabs appear last
