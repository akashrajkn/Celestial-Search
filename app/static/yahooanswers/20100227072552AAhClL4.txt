There's not really much you can do since your ISP is monitored by the government of the country. The only thing I could think of was to try and find a mirror to the site or try a proxy.
same problem here all you need is to change your IP to an USA IP
go to :http://www.ultrareach.com/download_en.htm
and download a small tool (free) 
or go to 
http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html
it contain a lot of free websites that will let you browse through them to blocked websites
Use a proxy or change ur ip or use invisibleurl.com to browse pages .
