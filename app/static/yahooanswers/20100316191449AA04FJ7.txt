can you pay for stuff on ebay with mutiple cards?
I have two mastercard gift cards, that add up to the amount I need to purchase something on ebay. can I use both to pay, or can I only use one? I need proof, because I do not want to buy something then not have the money to pay for it

I don't think they can be used simutaniously,but you should definatly ask the seller if he will except 2 different payments.
