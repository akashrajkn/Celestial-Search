How can this be (read details)?
On eBay Canada, I found a Honk Kong item on sale. It's two dollars with free shipping and it's a headset. Why on Earth would somebody waste like 50 dollars shipping a 2 dollar item over to Canada? Is this a joke? Are they actually gonna give me hidden charges? Please explain cheap items for me please.
Scam, really? Because the guy was 99.4% positive!

It's called a scam.
Its a scam I think
because in china stuff is really really cheap, look at there rating though...do not bid on anything where the person has under a 97-98% rating. You can read the comments other people left (which you're required to do when you buy items). They can't hit you with hidden fees etc, because of how ebay is set up....NEVER SETTLE OUTSIDE OF EBAY even if they request it, in this case it probably would be a scam. Always use paypal to be safe, because if you don't end up getting your item you can ask for a refund
its called broke
I buy loads of stuff from Hong Kong on Ebay, I`m in UK, everything I buy is very cheap and has always been ok.
At the moment I`m waiting for a small item that cost ?1.02 including shipping, don`t know how they do it but they do.

EDIT.
Can you put a link on for us to view it?
I would say if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  That said, often times people will post auctions with no reserve and no minimum bid to generate interest along with free shipping, hoping that it will get a higher bid. 

Also, it's likely not being shipped via AirMail - but by Boat, which only runs about 20.9 HKD for a 500g package (or about $2.69 USD). HongKongPost.com has a calculator that might help you estimate it as well.
