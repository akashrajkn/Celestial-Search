What shipping option should I choose when selling on ebay?
I'm new to ebay and I want to sell for the first time and there are a lot of options to choose from for shipping. I'm selling a book and I want to ship it the regular way ( the cheapest).

ship that sh** yourself, i use to use method to print up label, but i just sold it, wrote out my own label, and shipped hehe =) i beat the ebay system there for your not wasting like 15 dollars to shipp a book, and u still charge them for shipping so you make bigger profit. i started selling large items and the shipping ran me lik 80 bucks, so one day i recieved a package from ebay and im like wait this isnt a ebay  shipping label, so i decided to make my own never got in trouble, once he leaves you feedback after a couple of weeks it will appear that u shipped it, but usually if u ship it without printing label, the shipping, printing label will not be high lighted meaning you didnt print label. but it will go away in a few weeks =A)
I would do media mail. 
This is specifically designed for books, cd's, vhs, etc. 
It is cheap, efficient, and similar to a flat rate. 

The only drawback is that those packages are inspected more often to make sure that people aren't shipping items that do not fit these specs.  But if you are shipping within the guidelines, should be no problem.
