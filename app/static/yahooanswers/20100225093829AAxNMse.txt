Why can't I get onto solefootwear.co.uk?
I saw an ad in a magazine for it, but i can't get on |:
Is it just me? Can you get on the site?

This is what it says when i try visit the site:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

What is this all about?
Thanks!

Hi
They've have had a holding page up since Friday, as they further develop their site.
  

I have just checked and guess what......... it's back on!! Whoop whoop!
