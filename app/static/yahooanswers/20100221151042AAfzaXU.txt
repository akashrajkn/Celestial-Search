Anyone want to follow for follow on Twitter?
I decided to get Twitter tonight and would like some followers :)

Can someone follow please? I'll follow you back, no worries.

Thanks in advance.

I'll follow me if you follow my blog gutterlickers.blogspot.com. Just click the follow option, and it gives you the option to follow from twitter. Once I see you in my followers, I'll return the favor.
I followed you. I also suggest heading to a Twitter train and adding yourself. Other people will add you in return. http://targetfollowers.com
