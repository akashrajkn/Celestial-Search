How do I know what wave I am in at Lockerz.com?
I paid 100ptz for one redemption but when I go to ptz place it keeps saying "Sorry you're not in this wave"
JIMMY!!! I LOGGED IN WHEN IT WAS WAVE 1 TIME AND IT SAID THE SAME THING

you paid for wave 1 WHICH ALREADY HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The only choice you have now is to try redeeming something in the general redemption
I hate lockerz its gay and retarded. THats why i never got to reedeem
Jimmy when is the general redemption
u payed for the 3rd... http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=rockthat97 is better
I think lockerz don't work well, the all video is fake!

It will be better use this service: sonsoldi.it

The only services certainly working are on "sonsoldi".
