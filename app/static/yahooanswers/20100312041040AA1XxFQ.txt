Investment for these are:

There are so many ways to make money online however these ways all have HIGH profits, very low risk and low start-up costs and each can be used for just about any topic or subject you could think of. So you could go into multiple markets / topics and - spread the risk, if one marketplace were to go slow, others you have will continue to thrive and make money.

*Write down as many topics, subjects and hobbies you can think of and that you enjoy.
Then go to https://adwords.google.co.uk/select/KeywordToolExternal

Use the Google Ad words tool to see what Keywords people are searching for online, type in the topic and see how many people are searching the Internet for that particular topic. 

Choose a keyword for example: scuba diving equipment 

Then go to http://www.seologs.com/keyword-difficulty.html

And type in the keyword to discover how difficult it is to get a good ranking in Google - I would say a difficulty of 40 or less and you'll have a great chance of getting on page 1. 

Hope this helps

There are many good work from home jobs and there are many good home based businesses. A job is one where someone will pay you to do their work at home. A home based business is one where you'll earn commissions for running a business from home. If you're just looking to be paid for your services, do your research...you have to know the type of job you want to do, then look for companies that offer that type of job.
Smart Bargain Hunters is a good website for making money online. If you are patient and use a good bidding strategy you can usually win items that cost around $300 while only spending $30. Then just sell back the items on Ebay for around retail price.
Here is perhaps the best article I have found on this:
