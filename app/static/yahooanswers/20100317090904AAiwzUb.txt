Why my status bar most of the time say " Done, but with errors on page"?
the status bar that is in my internet explorer page down under thats say's " done but with errors" and there is yellow sign with it. How can I fix it because sometimes I cant for example click back botton and it responds, so what should I do?


Thank u very very much
 P.S I always delete my history and cookies when I see it but it doesnt work

that is due to website server errors or your internet speed...
Either your internet connection is so slow that it's timing out before the page fully loads, or it's a problem with the page itself.  If it's not your connection, there's really nothing you can do about it, because it's on their end, not yours.
Usually that is due to a problem with the script on the webpage you are visiting. Microsoft has an extensive trouble shooting page on the subject manner including changing the script error settings.
