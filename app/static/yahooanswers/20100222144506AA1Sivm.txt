does anyone kno the site where you can change your  font to look like this?? ???  ?????? ??  ????? ?? ????  ???


That's a good question! I think it's just font on word, but I'll research for you. Keep checking back.

Can't find anything. I found a site where they have all letters, used it for my myspace.

Sorry I couldn't help. :/
Google "different font styles" or something like that.

Ahh, I knew it was called ASCII, but didn't look it up because thought it was using characters to draw symbols.

Just enter text in and it will convert
