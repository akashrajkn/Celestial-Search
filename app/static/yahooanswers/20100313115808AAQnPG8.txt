Why do so many online movie sites require things when so many others are free?
some wont let you watch movies unless you sign up, buy, take a survey, etc.
others are completely free and might even have better quality.   does anyone know why this is?

that would be because some are legal (those you have to pay) and some are not
its all about making money, they pay for storage and bandwidth, others are doing for fun
The free ones are ad supported 
Enjoy all the spyware you get from them
