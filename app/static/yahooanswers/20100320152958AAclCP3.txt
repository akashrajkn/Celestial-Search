Why can't I right-click in Firefox anymore?
Every now and then, I lose the ability to right-click in Firefox. Usually restarting FF or my computer solves the problem, but now it's not working. It's definitely not a problem with my computer itself because right-click works fine in all my programs and Google Chrome. What should I do?
Yes, I mean I can't right-click to open a new tab, save pictures, view properties, etc.

I'll try the Yahoo toolbar thing, thanks.

Do you mean right click to show all the options on the menu like Open, properties etc? If so try reinstalling firefox remember to make a backup of your favourites.
