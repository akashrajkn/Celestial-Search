Why does Formspring.me suck so bad?
EVERY time I go on there, there is always something wrong!
The search doesn't work, I can't log in, questions won't show up, I can't ask questions, ect.
The person who made this website really has to work on it and check up on it, cause it's really annoying!
Don't you think?

I know it freakin sucks I cant search ppl! it says theres an error proccessing. These ppl need to get their crap together for this website
