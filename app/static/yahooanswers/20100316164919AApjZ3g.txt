Omgpop isn't loading?
i was literally on the site 10 minutes ago, got off, and then went back to the website and now it won't load... all i get is a blank white screen. i've tried restarting my computer, deleting all cookies, reloading my browser, refreshing.... idk what's wrong with it?

there might be something wrong with the WEBSITE not your computer.
works for me...
try this

lockerzinvitz.tk/
same thing here.
but i'm using windows 7 and the newest internet explorer so i chose the "view in compatibility mode" option and it shows up fine now.
