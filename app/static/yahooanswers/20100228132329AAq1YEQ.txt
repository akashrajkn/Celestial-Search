NEED HELP OF SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE INTERNET WELL!?
Is swavi.org really bad... It seems kinda good to me? But loads of people say it hacks your accounts, is this possible? I am so clueless when it comes to technology! :(

I've never been to tht website. But, if it asks u 2 sign in using an aim, facebook, or whatever, it will hack your account
Site has really poor reputation on Web of Trust.  Do not use.
