worldwide ebay import/export ? Is it possible?
i am travelling to India and Sri Lanka to my friend's place
and i wanted to buy stuff from ebay.com from the sellers in US, Canada and Europe but while i am staying in india

My friend's got a valid Indian address there in india.

so can i buy stuff from our US based sellers on ebay in india?

Experienced eBay sellers consider it to be very suspicious if they are requested to ship the goods anywhere other than the bidders registered address.
Many sellers are not willing to ship worldwide due to the high level of dishonesty - people receive the goods and then claim the goods never arrived.  The seller has lost his goods AND been forced to refund the money to the dishonest buyer
have your friend buy it for you & ship to him
