Paypal alternative for 15 year old?
Is there a paypal alternative for a 15 year old were I can shop and earn money online. But without a bank account? I tried Paypal Student Account but it wouldn't let me sign up for some reason.
I want to earn money too so I need something I can get money with too

Well,you don't need a bank account if you want to buy online there are a lot of Visa Gift Cards or just some Cards form other company that offer you the way to charge a card with money every day when ever you want. You should find this cards at a computer store or at the bank.
Why not have a website? See:

they train you for free, show you what to do.
You could try network marketing. It allows you to work around your schedule, kids, school, etc.

Find something that peaks your interest. Perhaps make-up, clothing, accessories, shoes, health products, cleaning products, baskets, etc.

Just find something that you can get excited about and then go for it.
Get into internet marketing, it doesn't have to cost you a cent.
Get a site, get traffic to it (a separate blog might help here) and all sales you generate are yours.
