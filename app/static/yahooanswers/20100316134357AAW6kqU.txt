Is there a page where you can find everyones birthday in the world? Like normal people?
And find out where they live??

Birthdays - no.

Addresses - perhaps. You could try an online phonebook if you know what city they live in, although obviously that will only list whoever has the phone registered to their name (so you'll have to know who that is - you won't be able to look up every individual person).

With the exception of the phonebook, there aren't any huge public databases that just have this information for anyone to use.
no
