where can I go to download a huge library of the latest mp3 music?


iTunes is good, but I assume you mean for free.
I just use Youtube to MP3 converters.
Get an account with eMusic.com. The download cost works out to about 30 cents per song more or less, depending on which level account you get. If you can't afford that then just listen to the radio, it's still free.
You should have a look at http://www.mp3obs.com All latest tracks and albums at a really low price - $0.10 a song! Its legal, safe and virus free aswell!
http://www.mp3-music-download-sites.com/ 
I find my music from here, maybe you can have a try with it
By the way, you can use google or yahoo search, just type the name you want, you can find out everything from the search engine, this is how I did. 
And here is an article recommend you

www.mp3obsession.com
If you don't want to use itunes coz its so expensive I would recommend http://www.legal5ounds.com - they have virtually every song ever recorded and its only 9? a song - they're also offering a trial where you can get the top 40 for free!
To http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ 

Hope this helps. Regards!
