Quick question about my internet?
Ok so i have the full upgrade from ATT's elite, and my dad's computer has a faster download/upload rate then mine.  A support dude came out and said it could be some program.  
Could his or my anti virus blocker be the internet speed stealer?  
I have AVG Free
He has Norton 360 and McAfee Secruity Scan (NO ANTI VIRUS)

AVG does not take up your internet. i have it too and its fine for me anyway. maybe ur dad computer has a better Receiver than urs for the internet signal if it is Wireless. 

internet speed is slowed down due to loads of things such as:
length of wire.
objects and walls in between wireless signal receiver and transmitter.
strength of receiver.
strength of transmitter. 

good luck and sorry if this doesnt answer you.
