is myeasygpt better than points2shop?
idk which ones better.

In my opinion they both tie. Each have their offers, and their little extras! I have stopped using both site due to spamming reasons. 

Just a suggestion...but now I use swagbucks.com. It is a search-and win site. So you search the internet like you do every day. But you are randomly awarded swagbucks for your searching. And you trade that in for awesome prizes!!! If you would like to sign up feel free to sign up here.

Points2shop is by far the best site for earning free cash/prizes. I've been a member of all the get free stuff websites: Prizerebel, Swagbucks, Lockerz, myeasygpt,Rewards1, and cashcrate. They were all really hard to earn points on. It was very time consuming. And I never got anything from those sites.

If I were you I'd go to points2shop. You can earn points so easily on points2shop by completing offers, surveys, playing games, or simply by clicking on links! It¡¯s that easy! I just received an ipod nano from points2shop in the mail last month. You get all your prizes directly off amazon.com, which makes shopping for prizes a lot easier because amazon has every item you could possibly want. 

Points2shop is best, fastest, and easiest site for getting free stuff. Best of all Points2shop is 100% free.If you need to know more information you can check their forums where members post the things that they have received for earning points on the points2shop website below.

The only way to get 250 free bonus points is by going to the link below and signing up.
