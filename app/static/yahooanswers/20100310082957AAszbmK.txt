What is the best and safest place to setup an email account for my 14 year old teenager?
I have a yahoo email account and it is flooded with obscene mail and telemarketing. Ditto for MSN, they both have non stop porn, drug, and marketing sites soliciting via IM, etc.
Is there ANY relatively safe email service out there?

Gmail
Yeah Sure! Gmail is the safest and the best!
gmail! absolutely safe
Take a domain name of her interest or in her name, provide mail id with spam filter.
She would be happy to receive personalized email.
I have 11 e-mail addresses. Of which one is g-mail. I would have to recommend  g-mail as the best for you.
