Firefox or Internet Explorer? Which is better?
Which is better, firefox or internet explorer? And why?

Firefox better. Now both my daughter and my husband are using firefox. Why, it is quicker etc.
Firefox currently uses fewer system resources and has a plugin that can enable it to render using internet explorer if it is required.

This answer written using Firefox.
I prefer Chrome.
But, if you need to choose between those two, then Firefox.
Firefox.


It is much, much faster. Plus it has a sleek design ;)
It is a matter of opinion.  I use Internet Explorer at the moment because my Firefox locks up after about ten minutes.
Firefox is "lighter" - meaning that it uses less system resources than IE, but beyond that the main reason why you shouldn't use IE is because it's way too interconnected with Windows. While in certain cases that may be a convenience, it also means that it makes far too much of Windows available to the internet. One little security bug in IE, or any of its plugins could mean some pretty hard times for your entire Windows install. With Firefox, it's just an app. While it is still possible to get viruses and spyware through Firefox, especially if you're not using common sense, the chances of it directly affecting your Windows install are much much less.
Firefox.. its faster and more reliable and with all the addon's available you can almost do anything off your browser on the net
firefox all the way
Without a doubt, Firefox! I have tried all the browsers including chrome. And I always go back to Firefox.
I use both and have no preference.  Check them both out and see which you like, or if you even have a preference.
i vote for FIREFOX

because it is more handy
