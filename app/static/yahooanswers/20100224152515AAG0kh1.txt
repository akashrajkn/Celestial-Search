10GB useage allowence - can i watch 4od bbc iplayer etc?
i have a 10GB usuage allowence and have been watching a bit of tv on the laptop lately (4od BBC iplayer etc) ..can 10gb handle this or am i going to have a massive bill? (i generally also spend about 4 hours ish surfing the internet a day)

loads of room. if you go over the top they will inform you dont worry.
Keep it to 30 mins or 60 mins viewing maximum per day and you should be fine.
if each 30minute tv show is around 500mb you could watch about 20 tv shows before using up the full 10gb it'll be used up quicker if you watch the shows in HD
