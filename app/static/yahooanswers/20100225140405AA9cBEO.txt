How can I get my money back from ebay?
Ok so i bought this 1 item like 3 weeks ago, and the estimated arrival time was supposed to be from the 14 to the 22 of this month but it didn't arrive and well that's why i want to get my money back, but the thing is that I paid with a debit, so what would I have to do.

i will appreciate it if someone can answer this......=]]

Have you contacted the seller to enquire when it was posted? Do that first.
If they dont reply or give a unsaitsfactory answer start a item not received dispute through ebay. 
I understand you paid with a debit but was the transaction made through paypal? If so, start a dispute with paypal too If not contact your bank.
