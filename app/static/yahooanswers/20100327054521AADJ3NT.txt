I'm answering this using firefox.....you can guess the answer
Er no!  But where were you looking? LOL

either re-boot or re-install the software.
Firefox is a a browsers so it only runs at the speed of your internet, so your internet connection would be down. You could try and reinstall firefox to see if that would help but it is would be your internet connection.
