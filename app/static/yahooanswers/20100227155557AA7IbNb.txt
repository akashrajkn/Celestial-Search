What's with Kingdom Hearts Insider?
I used to go there all the time, but recently Norton's been telling me that it has almost 200 viruses. Can anyone explain this?

Maybe it has unsafe downloads,because there are many downloads on that site.So maybe that is the problem.Remember,the downloads could be user-submitted,so the users may not know,or they just want to infiltrate your computer.
Hope THis Helped!
I have AVG and it will let me go onto KHI but it blocks the KHI fourms :( I dont relly know whats up with it, i used to get on all the time too...
