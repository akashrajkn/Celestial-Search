Is this a possible virus?
My laptop has randomly gained a new shortcut on the backscreen. It says An important choice to make: your browser. Which i quite strange because my computer already works fine. It then gives me a choice of browsers to download went i try and close it down. The window comes up everytime i turn on my computer.
If it is a possible virus, how do i get rid of it?
