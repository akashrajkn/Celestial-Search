Why do i keep being instantly outbid on ebay!?
ive been bidding on a bass amp because i need one with a higher wattage for my band. every time i bid it sends me straight to a page saying ive been outbid. i don't understand how this is possible. could someone please explain whats going on!? >_<

People now can get a program that automatically bids for them.

Dont bother asking about setting it up because i heard its really hard.

The only way to not get out bid is to outbid them.
Whaen they set it up on the item they enter the total value they would go up to.
All you have to do is go over that price and you wont get outbid.
you don't need a program to bid for you... all they do is put in their max bid and it will automatically put in a bid just higher than yours until you pass their max bid. it's been that way for a long time.
When you bid for an item on eBay, you enter the maximum amount that you're willing to pay. If the item is at $10 and you're willing to pay $50, then you'd enter $50 as your bid. If somebody has already bid higher than you, say $60, then you'll be instantly out-bid even though your bid is greater than $10.
because of a feature that when someone bids higher than you it automatically bids higher upto a certain amount u preset,its there on the ebay bidding page.
