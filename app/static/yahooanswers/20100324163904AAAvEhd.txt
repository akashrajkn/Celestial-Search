It's not working for me, either. They may be updating the servers. Try again in an hour.
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME TOOOOOOOOO! I WANTED TO PLAY REALITY TV ISLAND FOR DAYS THEN THIS HAPPENED!
This is SOOOOOO unfair! All these Poptropica fans have been waiting to play Reality TV Island, and it's down for maintenance.
Because There Are Too Many People On The Site ...
