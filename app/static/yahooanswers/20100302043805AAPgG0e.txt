What bugs you most about ebay?
I mean it's a great site and all that and I did sell my car on ebay but so many people seem to advertise items, especially clothing, as brand new and yet when it arrives, it has clearly been worn a few times, I rarely buy anything on there these days as I found I was putting more stuff in the bin than I was actually keeping!
What experience have you had with it, good or bad?

Forcing sellers to use Paypal is very annoying as they double-dip on fees.

The dispute resolution process makes it possible to receive goods without paying.

The site is mostly full of professional merchants who use Buy It Now rather than being an auction site anymore.

Having said that, it's still great for finding rare things and for cheap, generic consumer electronics.
The fact that 95% of the people selling are now companies and not just people.  Used to be easier and cheaper to get things on there.  Now, it's a waste of time.
What's good about it ? The only thing "different " about it is how they take your money,  they get around to it.
 I don't think there is any originality to it. Except in the mess they created
