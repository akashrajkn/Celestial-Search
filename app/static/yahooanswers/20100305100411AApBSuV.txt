Why do people bid up an ebay auction with 3 days left?
It makes no sense to start a bidding war 3 days before the auction ends, only to certainly be sniped in the last seconds anyway.

Bcuz they don't have time to bid the day it ends. I always go through the stuff & give the highest bid I would consider paying for that item, if I lose, I lose.
Just not very smart I guess. I agree it is definitely in the bidders best interest to not bid aggressively until the very end. Sometimes I wonder if some of the sellers have a friend bid on a item to push the total up. I have been involved in a few bids that just didn't seem kosher.
there are different strategies for bidding, is all. I personally watch an item for a few days, to see where the price is going, then enter a max bid and wait. I know what the item is worth to ME, and how much I am willing to pay for it. I have no real interest in cheating anyone out of their fair market price. If someone wants the item more than I do, they are free to pay whatever it is worth to THEM. If, at the last minute, I decide it is still priced below my limit, and I am still, somehow, not the highest bidder, I'll add some $ to my bid. Bidding wars are for dealers and idiots.
