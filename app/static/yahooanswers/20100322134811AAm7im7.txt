Internet Question......?
Hi, I was thinking about getting a laptop for my schoolwork. And I was wondering if I use my parents WIFI, do I still have to pay for internet or will it just feed off of their system.
Thanks in advance.

No..,there will be no additional charge to use your parents WIFI.
It'll feed from the house system.. You can load it up with as many computers as you like.
That depends on the ISP. If you're using pay as you go, then it will cost more. If it's just a monthly flat rate payment, then you don't have to pay for internet.
Hello -- if your parent's would be willing to add your laptop to a home network (which is fairly easy to set up), you would be able to use their WiFi.  In fact, if they have the right internet package, you could even have free WiFi available to you in other locations besides home use.  For instance, I have AT&T Elite (6.0 Mbps), which includes 17,000 hot spots nationwide.  If you've ever traveled before, you know that sometimes hotels and other places will charge you for an internet connection.  However, if you have AT&T, you are very likely able to get a connection without having to pay the extra fee.  Hope that helps.
