Does Formspring ever take a while to publish your answers?
I'm on Formspring and I just answered like four questions, and then they disappeared. They didn't show up on my profile, answered, and they're not in my inbox anymore. I clicked "Respond" then I answered then I clicked "Save" and they dissolved and it went back to my inbox, like normal, and now they're not there. Does it sometimes take a while?

The same thing happened to me too!!

I think it's just today, because there are others who are having the same problem...a few of my friends are, plus there is another person on Answers who asked the same question, and a few answered back with the same problem. Looks like it could be just a glitch in the system, since it seemed to be having a couple problems yesterday. It won't post my answers on Facebook either, so it's Formspring's site that's having the problems. 

 I think it might just be backed up, so the answers should be coming up in a few hours or so.
