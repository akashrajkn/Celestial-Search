AOL 9.5 Problems using dialup.?
When trying to make a dial connection on a PC running Vista and AOL 9.5 I either receive the blue screen of death or the following error. AC - 1102 0x84200105. If I use Broadband I have no problem. But need to use dial-up at work.

Any ideas?

Thanks
I run ccleaner Daily.

The easiest and fastest way to solve this problem is to run a registry cleaner software. A registry cleaner can eliminate errors in your record. This record stores all information about the software, drivers, applications and games that are installed on your computer. And in time, it can get bad, because some obsolete entries are not deleted and can lead to what they call the "errors". By using a registry cleaner http://make-a-computer-run-better.com          the  errors can be eradicated and increases the speed of your computer in the process. Registry cleaners work by scanning each file and then checking to see if it's corrupt or causing problems. If they find that it is broken, the registry cleaner will replace or fix the file for you to make your computer become free of errors.In addition, the errors will not happen if you regularly check and care for your computer system.
