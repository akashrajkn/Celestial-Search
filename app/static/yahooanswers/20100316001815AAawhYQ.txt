best vpn for secure browsing?


If your looking for a good one to do that "not so legit" stuff the use the one on multifake.com its paid but totally worth it.
www.itshidden.com is one of the best and easy to setup without installing any extra software, if you are using windows 7 or vista.

The free service is also there but auto disconnects after 20-30mins
