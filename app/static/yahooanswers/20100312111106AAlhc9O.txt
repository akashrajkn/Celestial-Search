I need a cool blog name please help?
I need a blog name I plan on blogging about random things so I was hoping for a name that was random and catchy.

cunt fuck cock whistle?
strychnine
ok. (you could change the spaces to underscores.)
Random food based blog names:
"The Magic Potato" (I like this one! :D )
"Golden and Crispy"
"Cookie101"

Random Animal based blog names:
"Deadly Blue Bird"
"Dancing Iguana."
"Bad Ass Donkey"

I hope I have either benefited you, or wasted a part of your life! Enjoy! :D
You can call your blog "Honey Pot" "Sour Grapes" "The Fuzz" "Jumping Beans" "Falling Ducks" "Burning Sneakers" "What The Fetch" 

Just get creative and start pairing random adjectives with random nouns. Lol, sounds fun. Good luck with your blog! :)
Aldavido.
To get better answers you should also have given the details about the content etc the website will showcase.

Just to contribute, I think what you should do is just try to visualize your blog (if it's nonexistent right now) and then ask yourself, what phrase or word defines it. It's not necessary that the blog name is spelled correctly or it should sound logic or is coherent. As any blog takes its identity from its content rather than its title.
