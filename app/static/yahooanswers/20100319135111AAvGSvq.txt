open Firefox and go to bookmarks file menu >> organize bookmarks >> import and backup 

u can easily create backup for your bookmarks at any location on your disk.
If you install the free tool here: http://www.xmarks.com/ then it will keep your bookmarks synchronized among all your computers, irregardless if you're running IE, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari, Mac or Windows.
