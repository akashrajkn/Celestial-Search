is beezid too good to be true?
i mean a ps3 sold for $00.85.

Obviously you did not investigate any further than looking at prices. 
I must say, its a smart new approach to online auctions, hats off to smart entrepreneurs. 
More details:
1) To Bid, you Must Buy Bids, each cost $1, they are in packages of 10-20 etc... i think... 
2) The platform uses a timer that emphasizes URGENCY (smart Marekting) 
3) You can get a ps3 for that low, Even if you pay shipping fees, its still one heck of a deal !!!! come on.
4) But if you misuse AUTO BIDDING, you & 20 others might end up covering the cost of 5 PS3 :))
5) End of auction , your costs are: 1) The Bidz used, 2) The final Win Price 3) Shipping costs

In closing, it's a fun and new way to shop online, go get your self some amazing deals. 
They are a legit company out of my city and i spoke to them a couple of times. 
I highly recommend them.
Vicky pretty much covered everything.  Beezid is definitely legit.  However, it is difficult to win auctions on the popular websites because there are too many users there which results in more people outbidding each other and higher prices.  Try sites like smartbargainhunters.com if you want to increase your odds of winning.  It is only a week old and has fewer users.  Also, try bidding in the middle of the night when less people are online.
