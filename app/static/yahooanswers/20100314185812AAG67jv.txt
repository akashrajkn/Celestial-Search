Is there anything similar to top sites that safari has, for internet explorer?
You know how Apple's Safari has the top sites feature? Is there anything similar to that for PC, internet explorer? I know you have your favorites bar but I want something big and visual that I can just click on when i open the internet.

Should have. You should check out firefox plugin and check
The easiest way to do this in IE8 is just press Ctrl+Shift+H, (to bring up history), and they you can select to view your History by "Most Visited".  Hope that helps!
