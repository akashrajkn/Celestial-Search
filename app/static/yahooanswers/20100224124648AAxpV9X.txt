Ebay scam? Please help?
A eBay user told me that he would just send a invoice through paypal so he is able to avoid eBay fees. Is this legit? Or is he trying to scam me? Is there a gurantee paypal will protect me from the scam?

This is a scam. Avoid at all costs.
the only time you shouldn't use paypal via ebay is if the person is collecting in person and wants to pay cash. that way you know your getting physical money / item
You should always try to have the guy pay you first.  Or if you are the buyer, pay first.

There is no protection guarantee.  eBay has terrible customer service and won't help.  PayPal might though.
Paypal will not protect you if the buyer did not bid thru Ebay, and Ebay wont either. Youll either get a spoof paypal email that the money is in your account, but its not there. Or you will be sent money stolen from a hacked account, that paypal will refund from you once the real acct holder reports the theft, or the buyer will claim they never got the item or it was damaged, and paypal will refund the money from your account. Never ever ever deal with offsite transactions on Ebay or you have no protection if you are scammed. Tell him he has to win the winning bid thru Ebay or you will find another buyer. And only ever ship to the paypal owners registered address, nowhere else, or you are not protected. If you ship anywhere else paypal and ebay won't refund you if you are scammed. You also have to send the item so a signature is required at delivery and keep a copy of the receipt in case the person tries to claim they didnt receive it. Also insure it so if they claim the item was damaged the insurance will cover it
