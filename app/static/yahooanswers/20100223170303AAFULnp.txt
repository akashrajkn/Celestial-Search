Formspring hasn't been working?
When I try logging on, it says " Oops, We are working on getting the site back up as fast as possible. Please wait a few min and try again."
But it has been like this for the past week.
When I have miraculously logged on, It does not let me respond to my questions.
Some sort of error message pops up.
Am i alone?

no haha i thought that i was alone! the same thing happens to me. i got a lot of questions and i cant respond to them! whats worse, is that my following page isnt working either. im following like a million people, but none of their answers has showed up since last week. and im positive that they have all been answering questions and for some reason im not seeing them. aahhh when is formspring gonna work again!? :)
