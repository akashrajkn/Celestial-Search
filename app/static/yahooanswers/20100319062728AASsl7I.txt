Is Developer Hut an Internet Scam?
I ordered some services from these people and so far they have sent me like 6 e-mails saying they are backed up.  I canceled my order becasue it has been over a month, but never got a refund, now I am seeing on other forums that this is common from this Jon Waraas guy (who I guess runs the company).  Has anyone ever received their refund?

Yeah, I got the same answer from them.  I called and called their number and no one ever picked up.  I canceled the order online and no one ever got back to me.  I finally had to file a claim with my credit card company and they did get me my money back, but it took like 3 weeks.  That Jon Waaras guy is a scammer and Developer Hut is just a way for them to take your money and never provide the service.
This guy Jon Waraas is bad news.  You might never get your refund unless you make a claim.  I googled his name and went to his blog and it appears that he's not updating or allowing comments right now.  I don't know what to tell you other than file a claim, but when these "internet guru" types try to disappear, that means something is seriously wrong.
