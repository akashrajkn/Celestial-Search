Can you buy something off of Amazon by mailing a check to them?
I don`t want to give away my credit card number, so would this be an option? Thank you.

I went to my own Amazon account & these are the payment options.->

Credit or Debit Cards

Gift Cards & Promotional Codes

Amazon.com Store Card

Checking Account
I'm not sure, but I do know you can buy by putting your checking account information in and they will take it directly from there. Making it even easier than sending a check. You just go to payment options and enter your banking account information. 

Amazon covers everything...lol
