Do you have to pay to use AOL?
If you do then why would people? I mean obviously you have to pay for internet service too or is AOL an internet service? I have never had it but once and it was a free trial. I still had to pay for my other internet through my cable company and then after the free trial I would have had to pay AOL too? Why is that?

AOL is free now.  They now make all their money from advertisements.
Can't understand why you would pay for AOL, i use Mozilla Firefox and love it you have a fast browser and you can change your themes with an add on called persona, i have used their email Gmail for a long time and find it very good and it is all free. When you get windows 7 AOL comes with it
There are two parts to AOL. There's AOL the dial-up internet service provider, which you pay for, and there's AOL the online content provider, which you don't.
I would not use AOL at any price. Besides Norton it is one of the worst things you could do to a Computer.
