what can a company do with my address?
Like, i do a site where i get free amazon gift cards, but the mail me the card, so I was wondering what they could do with my home address. Do they just spam me, or something worse??

Spam relates to the web, not to physical addresses.
If you don't want your actual address known, avoid all websites where the sending of items to your address is involved
