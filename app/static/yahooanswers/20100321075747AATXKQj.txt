How do I change my Default webpage in Firefox?
I downloaded windows live messenger last night and it changed all of my main pages on my browsers to some live messenger/bing website, I do not like it and want to change it back to google, how do I do that?

Thanks,
Johnny

Go to Tools, options  and then general tab. I can't explain this good (I have hungarian FF), so:
about:config then proceed and type browser.startup.homepage then edit and type the URL.
I think about:config is better becuase there are a lot of options!

Dear Friend,

Do the following procedure to change the Default Web Page in Firefox:

1. Open Mozilla Firefox.

2. Click Tools -> Options -> General (Tab).

3. In the Home Page Text Box, type "www.google.com" or any other web page that you would like to make as default.

4. Click OK button to apply.

1.  Simply open Firefox and in the address bar, type the location
you want (such as Yahoo.com or whatever). STAY on that page.

2.  Go to the Tools menu and then Options.

3.  Under "Home Page" click on the "Use Current Pages" button.

That will set your default home page to the one you have open.
