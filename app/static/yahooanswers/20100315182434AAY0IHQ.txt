Why can't I put more then one set of clothes on my Marapets character/avatar?
Yeah.
I go and select the item I want to wear in my closet, then go back and select another.
But the second item I select is the only one that stays on, the first one doesn't.
Help?
I'm new to Mara pets, I just joined yesterday. So I'm not sure how to do a lot of things.

There are several things you might be doing here.

1-When you click the clothing item, it shows your character with one bit of clothing, do you press "Update Character"? Then the first item will stay on.

2-Even if you do that, when you preview the next item, it will show just one until you press "Update Character" and then both items should stay on.

3-You may only wear one top, one bottom, one shoes and one wig at a time, so if you put a different top on, you don't keep the first top on.
