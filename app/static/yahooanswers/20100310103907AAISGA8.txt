Make sure you get a phone that is capable of using your local service!
I bought a mobile phone on ebay. Compared to in store prices for the same phone I saved upwards of 75 bucks! Do your research before you commit to buy. Make sure it's the lowest price for that phone and make sure it's the same company as your contract. If you don't have a contract yet, pick the best phone plan and go with that company. I don't know if you have bell in the states. But avoid bell! I hate my phone company.
