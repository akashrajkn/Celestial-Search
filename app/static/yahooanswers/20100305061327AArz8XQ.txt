How to block others from online virtual bidding?
For example I am using a website that sells cars and they run real-life online auctions. CAn I somehow block other bids? Is there a software that enables that? Or for example on Ebay? Thanks

Usually there's a end now option to the highest bidder, may need to look through the guides on the website
On ebay there is a setting in your my account > prefferences.

Buyer prefferences. This enables you to block certain bidders with the credentials below what you set. There is also an area to block certain bidders.

The site your on should have a similar section to enable prefferences.
