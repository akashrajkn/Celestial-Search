what is an online wish-list for?
As in a Walmart wish-list, what are they for?

To keep track of things you'd like to purchase or to be purchased for you. Most wish-lists have the option to share with people. Therefore you could provide that information to friends/family. The most common use is for weddings and baby showers.
to keep track of the things that you want
To give your friends and family hints on things you'd like them to get you for your birthday/Christmas, and also so you can easily find the item again if you don't want to buy it now but may think about it later instead of trawling through all the items in the shop again to find it.
