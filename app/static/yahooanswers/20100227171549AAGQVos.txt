How do I start my own website? ten points!?
I would like a good host recommendation. NO freewebs or anything like that, nothing tacky. It should also be fairly simple for me to create ( cause I'm not tech savvy) but look professional. Thanks in advance!

yola.com could be a good choice.  u can either choose a freeweb or pay to make it a website.  also go daddy, etc...
find a host with good servers
if you don't want a sub domain you need to know HTML and you need to pay $20 dollars a month for Hosting.
Hi

i was just about to say freewebs until i saw "NO freewebs or anything like that"

Godaddy.com you can have your site hosted for a very small fee. 

http://elance.com is another great site to find programmers and designers with out breaking your wallet.

http://craigslist.com and http://poshlistings.com to market your business for free with good results
As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com). To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them. 

You can reach reviews about this web hosting provider and its latest DISCOUNT COUPONS at:

They also offer "Free Site Builder" that helps you build your web pages without difficulty if you are not skilled in using any website creating program (WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get). You can use this service optionally. You can also create the pages offline with your favorite program (DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Microsoft Publisher, iWeb etc.), and then upload them to your web host. This is another easy way to get your website online.

Hi there, 

I recommend looking into Office Live Small Business. It's template-based, so you don't need to learn how to code to use it. You can choose your own domain name (www.yourbusiness.com). You get your own @yourname.com email address. It's ad free, and it's extremely inexpensive. You can learn more about it here: http://smallbusiness.officelive.com/en-us/

Cheers!
