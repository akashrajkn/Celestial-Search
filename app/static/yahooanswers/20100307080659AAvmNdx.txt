Polyvore won't work for me today!?
I went on it last night (and early morning) and it was fine. Then I went on this afternoon, and it won't work at all ! Is it working for you guys? Whenever I go to the polyvore site, it shows up as this plain white screen, and the polyvore home button is just an x in a box, and i cant sign in/comment/do anything!! :0 Whats up?

Ugh me too only I use Firefox and some time IE. It's really freaking me out because I'm a total polyvore addict O: :(
Edit: It fixed again :D
