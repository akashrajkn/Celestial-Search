What do you call the .au,.nl,.ru stuff on webpages ?
I know .au is for australia .nl for the netherlands .ru for russia .tw for taiwan .ph for philippines etc.,
but what do you call it?

top level domain
Web Country Codes on the Internet
as ElMarkio said 

Simply TLDs
Technically it is a "Top Level Domain" representing a Country Code in the Root Zone Database.
