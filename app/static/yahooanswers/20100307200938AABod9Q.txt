Story doesn't want to upload in Fanfiction?
Well, I recently uploaded a story yesterday and today when I checked in the search engine of the website it didn't show up. I put in the full title and some keywords but this - "No result found matching your keyword(s)/phrase. Please expand your search." - just kept showing.

Anyone know what might be wrong?

PS: The weird thing is, it DOES show up in my page but not in the actual search.

Hello,

It takes a while for it to show up in the search function just like if you're uploading a video to YouTube, they need to process it and in a few hours you should be able to search for it and find it; if not than I suggest you contact them for support as they will be able to help you more than we're able to.
