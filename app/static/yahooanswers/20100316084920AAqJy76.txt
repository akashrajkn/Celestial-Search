I changed my ip address and fcked up my modem.. Help me?
I bought mw2 on ps3 today and could not play online, I had to open some ports... Then I found that could DMZ my ps3... I followed instuctions and changed something in the medem menu... I went to 192.168.1.1 and I have beetel 220bx1... I remember that I changed something like ip address, I changed it to 192.168.1.101... Now I can't connect to 192.168.1.1 to change it back... I am doomed... I can connect to internet but not to 192.168.1.1, I tried 192.168.1.101 and other, but to no avail... And now I can't cnnect to it and change poerts... Please I'm dying, Help me

You should be able to reset your modem to factory setting. There is probably a recessed button somewhere on the modem that you can push and make it reset itself.
Go to start => Run then in the box that appears, type cmd to open the command prompt.  Once it's loaded, type ipconfig and press return.  You'll get a whole load of text appears but you're looking for the line that says Default Gateway.  This is what you really changed your router to.

If that doesn't work, it should have a hard reset button, usually next to the power switch.  Hold this in until the lights all flash then wait until the modem restarts itself fully before re-connecting on 192.168.1.1
