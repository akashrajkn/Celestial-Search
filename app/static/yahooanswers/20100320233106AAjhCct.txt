What's your web browser? And why do you like it?
Which browser do you think works well with Windows Vista?

Internet Explorer?

Mozilla FireFox?

Opera?

Safari?

Chrome?

What else..


Thank You!

Google Chrome.  It's definitely the fastest, and it has an effective pop up blocker.  I have tried internet explorer, firefox, and safari and I prefer Chrome by far.
Mozilla Firefox.
Mine is chrome. i have windows7, and chrome is standard. I guess chrome is better since its tha newest.
FireFox!! At first I didn't like it. but it's actually pretty cool.
chrome, cause its the fastest...

of course if i have to visit a site that doesnt support chrome i use firefox cause thats just as good and i dont really like Internet Explorer all that much.
Firefox. It's so customizable that I'd be hesitant to use anything else. The number of addons available on it is just insane.
fire fox.  because it is customizable and pretty cool
Opera has mail, im, callendars, chat built in and you don't need to configure the hell out of it to get it to do that. From what I noticed too it is more secure than IE out of the box and you don't have to set it up that way it just is. I need to use IE for school so I'm kinda stuck with it and MS gets all the error reports, its not that its an unsecure browser anymore its just the most heavily targeted
