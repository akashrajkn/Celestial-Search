is there any need to create a profile in the intelPROset/wireless??  i don't know how to create it either...plz help

you could try this: go to network and sharing center and click on set up a new connection or network and pick set up a wireless ad hoc (computer to computer) network.
in ur laptop, goto connection properties, from there goto sharing & security. share ur connection & click on allow other users to connect through connection... 

do same with ur Wi Fi connection..ur problem will be solved.
