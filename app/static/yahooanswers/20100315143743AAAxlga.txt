How often do draik eggs come in Merifoods in Meridell?
Not really rare ones but just basic colors. Is it rare or do they come at random times during the day?
   Thanks

they come up 1-2 a day. There isnt an exact time that it appears; it's random. The blue, yellow, and green ones are around 100k  and the darigan one is 1.6mil. They're extremely rare and they get bought out around 1-3 seconds after it's out, so you need to be fast.
