In fanfiction.net, is there a way to get rid of the advertise they show at the beginning of a page?
When you go to fanfiction.net, they show you this advertise at the beginning of the webpage. So is there a way to get rid of them? You have no idea how annoying they are. And now they have a new ad about "Quality Health" or something, and in this one, you can't even ignore them. There is no sign that can make you continue to the real webpage. 
So help please? Thanks.

When you first go onto fanfiction, hover your cursor over 'help' in the top right hand corner (underneath 'login' and 'sign up'. Then click on 'Ad Blocker' which should appear underneath. Click on the 'click here' link that comes up with the box and the ad blocker will stop ad's from popping up for 3 days. After the three days just do it again.

Hope i helped :)
