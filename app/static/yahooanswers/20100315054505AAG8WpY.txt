what does text messaging abbreviation ''xD'' mean?


it isnt an abbreviation
its a smiley face

the eyes are supposed to be like this: ><
or >.<

and a big smiley face like :D

hard to explain.
its a smiley face sideways.
Meaning "really hard laugh" (where D is a smiley mouth)
dude its a face the x is the eyes and the D IS THE SMILE xD
its like...an extreme smile XD look at it on the side
It is a smiley such as :D but the eyes are xD... for what it means, I would have to go with very happy/excited or craaazzzzzyyyyy!!! xD
It means that they are laughing hard...I think.
It's a short form of  new language for ppl that are too lzy to type the full words.some interpret it as a higher level of intelligence, I think it's reverse evolution.
A smile or laughing face.
