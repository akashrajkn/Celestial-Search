need some ebay help please ?
Hi  bought a product on the weekend and it was meant to be sent by 1st class post, the week went past and it didn't come, i emailed the seller to ask when they had sent it and so when to expect it by, they replied friday night and said they had sent it on tuesday so should arrive soon, though i feel it should have come by thursday or friday atleast, ive never had this problem before, anyway the product arrived on saturday and on the stamp it said fridays date- does this mean the seller had lied and only sent it off on friday and this is why they waited to reply friday night? does this mean negative feedback - the product was some perfume and it has made me question the authenticity of the perfume  they dont allow returns, it looks alright but  is there anything else I can do
thanks in advance :)

then contact ebay  thats who your dealing with!
Just because the seller doesnt accept returns doesnt mean its not authentic,  sellers do not accept returns for various reasons.  Of course if you believe its fake you will have to provide proof to paypal if you open a not as described dispute
As for the date stamp, parcels are not always stamped when they are intially posted, it may have have arrived on Friday, your local post office has stamped it then had it delivered on Saturday but it is a possibility that they posted on Friday.  Its hard to say?
Whats their feedback & postage stars like?
Personally I would give them the benefit of the doubt & dont think negative feedback is warranted.
