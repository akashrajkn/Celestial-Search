on twitter
if i want a celeb to reply to me,
how do i do it?
i've tried typing "@" and their name after with my message but i don't get any replies :(
i haven't protected my tweets
how do i get them to reply.
i want to wish my favourite singer happy birthday tomorow
on her youtube she said tweet me happy birthday tomorow
how would i do this and would she see it?
thanks.

go on her page, and reply to any random tweet, than you will see her name followed after @.
Than write your message.
She will get it.
yes you go on twitter, go to find people, find out her twitter name e.g. @sam_ni or whatever then you type @sam_ni happy birthday. and she'll see it.
they probably dont look at them anyways...
