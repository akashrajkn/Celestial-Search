When trying to video chat on skype, our avatar won't go away. How do we make it so you see us not our avatar?


The avatar means that the video is not going through.

Make sure you have everything activated and you've started the video.

You can start a video call by clicking on someone in your Contact list and then clicking on the ¡®Video call¡¯ button or by choosing ¡®Turn on video¡¯ if you're already on a call. You can switch video on and off during the call, by clicking the ¡®Turn on video¡¯ and ¡®Turn off video¡¯ buttons.
