It's pouring outside! What is there to do?
It's pouring and I'm on aim, surprisingly no one is online (I wonder what they're doing!) What should I do to keep myself not bored?

Answer questions here!
watch a movie online.... www.hulu.com
Yeah its raining here too and I'm dying. I'm only talking to one person on aim and he's no fun to talk to. All I'm doing now is stuffing my mouth with some leftover munchkins
maybe they are spending time with the family
There's always work to be done around the house! I know this because my wife keeps telling me to get off the computer and get something done! LOL!!!
