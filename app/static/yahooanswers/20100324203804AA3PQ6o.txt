do prizes on lockerz decrease points over time or do they stay the same?
This will be my first redemption ever and I am sad because as soon as they updated the redemption list I couldn't afford to get a video game the last list said that each game cost only 100 ptz this months ptz for the video games are now 400 ptz is this how ptz stay as or do they decrease over time and is there a hack to get more ptz that is easy to do without downloading anything or giving someone an e-mail address?
My current ptz are 192
I currently have 240 ptz
current ptz 274

Lockerz is a SCAM!
They won't decrease. But they are going to put in more ways to get points so it's just as easy.
Just watch all the play videos. You'll get 100 points by tomorrow
No, prizes won't decrease in PTZ value, they'll go up... Unfortunately, to get at the good prizes you'd have to be a ZLIST member and be very active in Lockerz (Inviting friends that actually accept, answering the dailies, watching all the videos, etc.) Sorry, I'm angry about that too. By the way, even if you had enough points your country has to win AND you have to make sure you don't miss the redemption.
Lockerz is a waste of time.

240ptz is good, you're putting some effort into it :) I dropped the site as I found it too hard to gain the ptz...
Since then I got an watch from http://myhotprize.com - it was boring too, having to fill up some questionnaires but at least I got my shiny prize in about a week :)

Good luck and let us know if you managed to get your game :)
