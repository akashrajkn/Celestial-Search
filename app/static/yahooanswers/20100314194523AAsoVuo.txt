Question for Polyvore members ..?
how do you make a set your icon .... ?
also , has anyone else noticed how when you create a set now , you have to *drag* the item ?? its been happening to *me* at least .. ughh , now i can't save anything to my items :O

maybe try doing "create a set with this item" instead (when not creating it)
you can also click on the item when in the creating part, click "add to set"



I'm sorry to do this but if you like roleplays you should check out
