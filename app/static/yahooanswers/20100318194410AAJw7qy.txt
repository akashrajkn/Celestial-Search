Where online can I find...?
A site that allows me to create a free, downloadable, fill-in-the blank form? Not the kind you print out and fill in... the kind I can put on my website and people can download it, save it on their desk top, use their computers to fill in the blanks, and then email it to me? I can create PDF ones but they never let you fill in the blanks... does anyone know a good site that allows you to create these? THANKS!
I can create a web form, but that is not what I want here- I need something LIKE a PDF form- so my visitors can download it- BUT I need them to be able to fill in the blanks WITHOUT PRINTING THE FORM so tehy can email it back to me. It is a LONG application and questionaire- several pages- so I do not want one that has to be printed nor do I want to use a web form. I can create it as a PDF or using Office- but when I test it, it will not let me type in the blanks- I need people to be able to type in the blanks on a downloadable form... any suggestions?

I know one, but not free. It is a very good one and expert in doing this. iMagic Survey Pro Software http://www.brothersoft.com/imagic-survey-pro-software-19905.html?utm_source=answer&utm_medium=sweet&utm_campaign=0
Besides, you could google keywords like survey or questionnaires for more choices. Good luck
