And now, my facebook isn't loading, and neither is Youtube. And also, google images won't show any images. Any suggestions of how to fix this? thankyou very much :)

Try Using Other Web Browsers like Firefox,Opera.....
system restore
If you are using Internet explorer, this is what you should do: 
Go to tools, --> Internet options ---> advanced tab. From there, click on the "reset" button. A box will pop up, and check "Delete personal settings" and click "reset". It should work fine after that.
if itis internet explorer go to conrol panel go to internet options and ctrl+d  then it will come to default profile then it will be ok if not then re install it from internet or automatic updates available in your computer
By cleaning you  mean disk cleaning or registry cleaning?

CC Cleaner is the best and only software that repairs only necessary registry entries. Others will do unnecessary actions. So try it again. And don't forget to backup your registrys.
