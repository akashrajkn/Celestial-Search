Ebay buy it now option?
I am new to Ebay and I wanted to figure out how to do the "buy it now" option on the items i am selling. 

Please help! Thanks!
I am selling items on ebay.. not purchasing. I want to have the buy it now price on there instead of bidding

If you have the money to pay for the item, you simply click on the "buy it now" button, fill in the payment (either paypal, or sometimes credit card) and you will have paid for the item.
At Ebay "Sell" module - on the Create Your Listing page will be an option ¡°Choose how to sell your item¡±.

You¡¯ll see 2 tabs, one for online auction, and one for fixed price. Click ¡°fixed price¡±, and you¡¯ll see the Buy It Now box.
