My mum join Twitter??????????
Do you think my mum should join twitter? - I am on Twitter and I love it so do my friends. 
My mum has lots to say so i think it would be ideal. When i ask her she'll say 'er...no because-' and all that. - Any ideas?

I think she should, it is great for social networking. My mom enjoys all that kinds of fun stuff, so yeah, beg her too, if you enjoy it.
Maybe she's a little put off by it because she hasn't used it yet and doesn't know what to expect.  Maybe if you sit with her and tweet a couple of times so she can see how it's done, and see how people respond, etc., she'll be more comfortable with it and be more willing to join. Other than that, if she ends up not wanting to, then it just ain't her thing.  :)
tell her it's like using the old party lines.  that's what my mother (60+) told me and how she likes to tell others about twitter.
