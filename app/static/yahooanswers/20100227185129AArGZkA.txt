No,, my computer error messages are spelled correctly,, you have malware which does not spell too well, may want to run a scan for said malware, i use this.. you may want to give it a try. Use the free version.. http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php ~

Edit :  sight is vision
site is the location or url address.
