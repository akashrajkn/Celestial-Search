Any good website to find online writing or design jobs?


If you're just looking for contract / freelance work, you should try oDesk, Freelance Switch, and other freelance job boards.  For a full time jobs, try out CareerBuilder and Monster.  Craigslist sometimes has some gems in their jobs section as well.
Depends on what you can write and design.

I might have some work for you.  Contact me and let me know what you can do, some examples of your work, and what you expect as payment, I'll email back.

Thanks
