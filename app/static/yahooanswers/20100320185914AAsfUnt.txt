Why does FlashFlashRevolution not work?
I used to play the game, and when i went back onto the site to play again after a year break, it says "patience, check back soon"
Its been like that for days, anyone know whats going on, or what they're doing?

could be upgrading the software/servers/ anything.
I've googled this along time ago and i heard that ffr was shutdown and the team didn't have the funds to keep it running.  Thats what i remember and it's probably wrong.  Im guessing that the team is trying to get money to run the site again.
