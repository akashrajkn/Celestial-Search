Ever wonder why celebrities always get death rumors?

This site is the one that creates all false rumors and panics throughout the internet. If you see on youtube people commenting that someone is dead, I suggest you look on this site and see if there is a post telling people to do it.

F?ck 4Chan. That's has alot of waps and perverts... And F?cking Furries.
Rule #1 and #2.
How did that tell us anything. It is pretty much some porn site.
