Can you tell me how did they found my address?
Ok so I won't get into the story but someone just threatened me in an email and said they know where I live... they typed my address next to the threat.  So how did they find my address?
I'm not listed.  I live with my mom and stepdad who both have a different last name from mine.  I searched endlessly online for my name matching my address.  Nothing came up.  Were they stalking me?  Or is there a site I don't know about that would show this information?  
Seriously, I'm not listed.  I'm freaked out.  I don't even have my phone under my real name or address.  I may have in the past but have changed my number since then....

It's pretty easy for anyone in the world with a computer to hack your address
You should call the police!
Well JAcob if someone knows your IP address they can tell a lot of things about you, definitely about your city of residence

But getting your home address is somewhat a bit too much.

Seems to me some friend of your playing a prank on you, sending you a mail from another fake email id to bully you or something.
This site provides the answer for your question. There are various sites inside try all you may be able to get. In fact I got one girl's address whom I have talked to while in a flight 10 years ago.
