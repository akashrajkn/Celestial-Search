do you read the matt roush column on tvguide.com?  how to send in a question?
i found on the website that his email is askmatt@tvguide.com, but when I sent him an email, it says "postmaster delivery failure - undelieverable mail".  is there a new email address to use?
i found out it's now askmatt@tvguideonline.com
