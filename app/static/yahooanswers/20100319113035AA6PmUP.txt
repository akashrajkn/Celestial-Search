Can't register into Gorillaz forum?
I went to Gorillaz.com/pbstandard as I read on the booklet of the Plastic Beach album, and when I fill out all the blanks correctly, and then I click the "Register" button, NOTHING happens!!! I click on it a BUNCH of times and it doesn't fricking work!!!!! IT'S SO IRRITATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Any idea what the heck's going on, or what to do about this???? Thx!

I got a blank page too, 
it doesnt matter, go to the email address youve given them and you will have received a confirmation from gorillaz that youre now a member, and a link, click on it, to go back to the forum, log in and youre done! :)
