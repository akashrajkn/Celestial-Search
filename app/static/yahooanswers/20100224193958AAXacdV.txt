what legible site can i use to download a faster internet?
also what kind of internet should i get? ie; firefox, google chrome, etc..

since when i go on youtube, twitter, etc sites they keep saying that i need a not a faster but a more modern browser.....

This does not make sense.

Firefox, IE, etc are browsers and have no effect on how fast your internet is.  Your ISP determines your internet speed.  Usually u pay more for faster speeds.

And if those sites are complaining about your browser, just download the latest version of whatever browser u like and install it.
