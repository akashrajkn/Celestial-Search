on mangafox .... how do i fix it?
i wanna fix the setting on Mangafox. i want it to go back to alphabetic order. 
so i clicked on rating in the optional search thing. but i want it back b/c i found out i like everything organized! It goes from AR to AT, then TE then back to A!! it's really annoying. does anyone know how to fix this?

you dont
when you looking at manga, above the manga names it says "series name" click that, it should help. i hope that helps.
