How do I get my internet explorer working again since its in "Working Offline" mode?
I can't get on the internet because of this. P.S. I do not have a file button on my browser.

In IE 8

click on tools and work online
Since you don't have file try tools and when you scroll down it has work offlline and it will either be checked or not. Uncheck it.
Click on file <> uncheck work off line.
Are you running Internet Explorer 8?

If not, here is a link to get you started:

In IE8 go to Tools then click Work Offline (so that there is an X over the globe)

I hope this helps!
