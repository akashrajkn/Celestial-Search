Is armydogtags.com a scam?
I bought some dog tags from this site.  I payed with a check which I mailed 5 days ago.  I haven't gotten a confirmation email that they received payment, and they don't respond to emails. Am I overracting? Is the USPS just extremely slow?  Or have I been scammed out of $20?

Why don't you call the 800 number on the website and ask them?
