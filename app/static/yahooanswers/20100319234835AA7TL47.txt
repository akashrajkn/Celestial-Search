is there a website where we can just write stuff like a diary?
Kind of like a blog but for ourselves

Xanga.com is much more of a community blog. You can quickly make friends there.

Wordpress.com is a professional type blog.

Piczo.com is a blog for teen girls

tumblr.com is a blog that is growing in popularity. Lots of celebrities have tumblrs and it is really unique and personal.


You can make any of these private. Xanga for sure you can post entirely private entries and even lock your blog to where no one can see it but you.

I use my Livejournal as a diary by not adding "friends" and making all my posts private.
bloopdiary.com even though not a lot of people use it you can write your diary's on there and customize your profile. you can also customize each diary entry to the look that you want it. the site also supports html in your entries!
