if every computer on earth was turned of would the internet still exist?

the Matrix has you f--kwit
I think it's in Bill Gate's cellar.  The internet will always exist in our minds, even if all the computers were turned off.
The Internet works by fetching information from servers spread around the world. Big companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc have huge datacenters that hold petapytes of data.
It doesn't really exist, its all in your head. Now turn off your fake computer and never turn it back on.
