Piczo: is it any good?
People who have a Piczo account, please tell me, is it worth the time?

Yes it is very much worth the time! I have created many Piczo website's! It's fully customizable and you can do about anything you want with it. I would recommend Piczo to anyone. 5/5 stars. It's the only website creator I will use!
