Does anyone know where I could get a free custom blogger design?
I am looking to revamp my blog, but I want a more personal look as opposed to a free generic template. So does anyone know where I can get a free custom blog makeover?

go www.blogger.com that you make very easy blog.
I don't think that you will find a "free" custom design. Custom means built specifically for your needs and building custom designs is a service offered by people. However, you can find thousands of free templates, on template sites, that look professional, and with a little work you can change the layout as you wish.
