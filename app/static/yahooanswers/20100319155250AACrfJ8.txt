What is the fraud verification process on FreebieJeebies and how does it work? What do they look at, etc?
I nearly have all my questions answered about this site and am thinking of signing up but can someone please inform me about the fraud verification process and what exactly it is? Is the site very strict about your referrals details and things like that?

Yes they are very strict, but they're giving out high value goods for free, so you would expect this.

Some general things.

-No duplicate accounts (no two acocunts with the same IP, same name, same email, same address etc)
-No paying with virrtual credit cards
-Ensure you complete your offer fully (for example, if you do the free trial from LoveFilm then make sure you order a DVD!)

In short, don't try and con them and you'll get your freebie!
