I accidentally clicked something...?
I was using stumble-upon (I'm 13), when I accidently clicked on something and ended up on some sort of porn site. Then it said I was in trouble and they knew my name and information and they were going to report be to the police and call my house! I'm really scared. I don't even know what I did. Is it just a hoax or can they really prosecute me?

yes they can and in -10 seconds ur done in jail
its a hoax dont worry
It is probably just a hoax, and you shouldn't be worried. It is very hard to find out name and other information of a first-time visitor of a website.
well first of all, they knew exactly all you personal info? if so, ya. you should be.
or look back, did you enter anything to an unknown site or something?
you may also have spyware. it gets other people the bility to see exactly what you are doing and what you type. either way, you make it sound really, you know, weird...

you should tell s/o.
its unlikely and if it actually said your name then i would be more worried but if it just said it knew your name more unlikely but either way you should tell your guardian...
They don't know that...don't sweat it.....
