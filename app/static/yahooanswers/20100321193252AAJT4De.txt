Is it illegal to watch movies online?
As far as I know, it is not illegal to watch movies online as long as you don't make a copy of it.
Is this correct?
I wanted to watch Alice in Wonderland on a website called www.vidreel.com but I'm worried that it might get me into trouble.
My brother refuses to tell me so I ask you peoplez of the internetz!

If you watch a copyrighted video that you did not pay for and did not legally obtain (legally obtaining may include a free trial for which you get to watch a free movie) then that is illegal, technically.
it is technically illegal because you're watching the movie without paying, and the producers won't get any money- so in a way it is stealing. though lots of people do it, so it doesn't cause much harm- i mean those producers are rich anyway, now they have to wait an extra month to get that jumbo jacuzzi in their backyard.
i do it all the time its not illegal as long as you don't post them i'll give you a website that i use.
