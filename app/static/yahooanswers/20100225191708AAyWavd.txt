Can't access website, could someone help me get this in?
I need to get some information on breastfeeding benefits for mother and baby on 4women.gov. The problem is that the site is not working for me (I'm out of the country and that is the only thing I can think of that is causing this). If someone could take a screen shot of the lists benefiting mother and baby or do a copy and paste thing and just send that to my email or post it in the answers that would be really helpful.

That address is automatically forwarded to womenshealth.gov and there is no obvious page as you've described.
