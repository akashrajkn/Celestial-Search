dont let them know about it. keep it to yourself and then they cant to nothin
avoid the internet.  for some reason people lose any courtesy or common decency rules when on the internet.  prob the detachment from people.
If you want to write - then write and don't worry about what other people think.  If you really want to know about your writing, then seek out people that will tell you the truth.  If you trust them to tell you the truth, then you need to accept their answer - good or bad and then use that advice with your next piece.
"flamming"?  You mean "slamming"? To criticize harshly; attack verbally.

Are you sure they aren't just "editing" or "critiquing" you?


Go ahead.  Write your story.  But remember writing is a craft.  There is always room for improvement.
