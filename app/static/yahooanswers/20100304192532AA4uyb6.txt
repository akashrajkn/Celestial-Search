how do you buy stuff off ebay?
when they ask for the credit card #, does it go to the seller or something, i dont trust people like that
my friend said something about i have to make a pay pal or something. 
can anyone explain how to make an ebay account & purchase things from ebay.

I can give you a short answer.

1. Sign up for eBay.
2. Get a Paypal account by going to Paypal.com and signing up.
3. When bidding sellers always tell you what they'll take as payment.

Paypal is the safest and common form of payment on eBay.
