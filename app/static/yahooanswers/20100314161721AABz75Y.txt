www.bluewaffle.com
if you find it, let me know. thats awesome! most auto maker sites will have a customize feature where you can build your own vehicle. of course youre limited to the features that company has.
like a build your own car type site, by adding accessories colour's and other features? Shop around to major car dealer websites in your area / country?
Kind of...

The only site I know of that comes to close to what you're seeking is NADA Guides site. This site has a couple features that may help you. One feature lets you compare up to four cars side by side. So if you have some idea of what your looking for, this could help you narrow things down. The other helpful feature is their "Build Your Own Car". Both features can be found under the "Car Research Center" heading on site.
