Why won't my contacts show up as online on windows live messenger?
I am signed onto my windows messenger, and my contact list shows up, but it says everyone is offline, even me. My boyfriend says he is online, but it says he is offline. What is the problem?

i have the exact same problem

im trying to reinstall WLM and see how it works
I'm wondering if it's only happening to the ones who sign in with a yahoo email address. Do you sign in  with one of those? I do, and my contacts with hotmail are having no problems at all.
