FictionPress.com .... private messaging?
When logged in to the website how can you view your inbox of private messages without going through your personal email. Is it possible?

I bet you are quere.
I wanted to know the same thing. I don't think you can :( Sorry
I don't think you can do that on fictionpress--that's a new feature on fanfiction.net that fictionpress hasn't added yet. They're working on updating the site some, so I'm predicting that it will be a new feature in the future. 
If it helps, the other users can't see your email at all--even though the messages go to your inbox, they have no idea what your email address is.
