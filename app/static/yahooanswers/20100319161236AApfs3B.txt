How do I update my Symatec anti-virus?
Windows XP

It shows the red shield symbol with the X on the task-bar. I click on Windows Security Center and it says the anti-virus is installed but its status is unknown. I open the Symatec anti-virus program and click on Live Update but its still says that its outdated.

You don't. Go to you control panel then add or remove programs and delete Norton. Probably one of the crappiest Anti-Viruses out there.
