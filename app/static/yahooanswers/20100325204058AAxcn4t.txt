Anyone know if there is any way possible to find out the date you added a buddy on aim?
Hey everyone, i dont think this is possible but im hope im wrong.  I want to find out what date I added one of my friends on aim on my buddy list. Is that even possible? Please let me know, and do you think if i contact aim they can search that up or am i just nuts lol thanks for everyones help

contacting aim on this minor issue is like asking a hurricaine to stop
if i was in their customer service, i would ask you if you had any idea on the month/year and just make up a date
try checking old email that you might have sent them
the question of whether you are nuts
