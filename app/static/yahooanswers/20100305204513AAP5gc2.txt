I just created a streaming radio station online, is there any site or any way I can advertise it to get listen?
I have created a radio station. I will play mostly electronic and hip hop music, and it will not be functional 24/7. Is there any place I can advertise it for free? or any kind of listing I can put up for it?
Hmm twitter and facebook seem like a no-no most of my friends don't like electronic music.

try promoting it through twitter and facebook if people like it they will spread the word... nominated for stumbleupon too...
This is an online classifieds site that I use:

It is similar to Craigslist and in many cases, BETTER. Good Luck.
