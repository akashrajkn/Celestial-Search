Gamevance asked for a copy of new york state Id for proof of address..is it okay to send them a copy?

my friend told me they can open up credit cards using you name if they have your id card,..is i true?

Hello,

I wouldn't recommend that you give them something like that, the site checked out as bad and I was blocked from reaching it since many users have reported that Gamevance makes unauthorized changes to your computer and gives you malware. I've provided a link to a website review in my Source section of my answer that will help you decide; I wouldn't recommend it though as they could use your ID for illegal deals.
