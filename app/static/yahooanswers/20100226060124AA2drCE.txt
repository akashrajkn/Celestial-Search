How to locate those HARD-to-find emails?
How To Locate those Hard-to-Find Customer Service emails. Take Yahoo! as example you can only find emails of staffs. Is there a book or a website that provides list of important people's emails like Yahoo! CEO, Yahoo! managing director or Google Director.

Just like this website: http://www.hardtofind800numbers.com but for emails ;)

Well I did a bit of research, and there doesn't seem to be a general directory of important email addresses. Probably to avoid spam. Spammers create lists of mostly guessed emails. Imagine if they could just get a list available on the web.

In general, most websites have a "contact us/me" somewhere on their site. Most likely at the very bottom. For instance: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html

That form sends an email to one of the staff members in the appeal department. Or whatever they call it.
