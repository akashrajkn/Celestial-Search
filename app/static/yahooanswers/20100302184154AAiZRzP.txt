Paypal Purchasing, and eBay?
I'm a person that has always used Amazon and only amazon, but apparently I can only find what I currently want on eBay. I have no checking account or a credit card so I can't verify. But I do online surveys that pay me via paypal. Can I purchase something through eBay without a verified Paypal? And can I be payed via paypal if it isn't verified, because I haven't cashed out yet.

No, it must be verified.
