I have tweets sent to me thru texting. Does the celeb know I'm receiving them that way?
Do they get a notification saying so and so is following you thru text? Do they get a notification when I stop getting tweets from then thru text like I stop the texting option. I got continous tweets from them so I removed the option of receiving tweets thru my texts b/c I have limited texting. Right after that, They stop tweeting.

Yes, they know and were extremely upset by your apparent disinterest in their affairs.
no sweety, celebrities do not know nor would they care.
