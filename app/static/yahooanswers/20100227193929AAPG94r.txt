Why won't Hulu work on my laptop?
When I try to watch videos, the page loads, but all that pops up is a black box(where the video should be playing).

Do you have the latest version of Flash Player installed?
Maybe you don't have Adobe Flash or your version is too old.  Get the latest version for your computer here:

install flash player and its only for USA so it wont work for other countries
