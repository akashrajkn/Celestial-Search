Question about Chat Roulette?
I feel like some of the ppl i get connected with arent rly there and it pairs u up with a fake video. is that true or is it all legitamate?

its all real sometimes you have to wait for someone to pair up with you
It is very easy to use virtual web-cam software with an image or video instead of a real web cam
