Can someone help me out please?
I'm making a documentary on the vietnam war and i'm having trouble adding video clips in. I'm using windows movie maker. And every video clip converter i use doesn't work out for me. I don't know what i'm doing wrong. Can someone give me steps on how to use it? or if someone can help me find a website that has video clips on the vietnam war you can download?
