Where can I find a character map?
Can anyone please tell me where to find a character map OR something similar but with more variety than the one on my computer? I'm looking for one that has more variety as in the various letters for say typing in swedish or russian  as well as a map or again something similar that has a better AND wider selection of shapes lie a friend of mine a few yrs back had something like the map but it had tons of diff letters and had shapes like stars, paw prints, etc etc.... the one I have on my computer doesen't have shinola and I see people type say their screen name and it will have hearts or a flower or some other kind of cool graphics..... thank you!!
I have Windows Vista and if some of this stuff needs to be made from scratch please send me step by step  instructions aka blonde proffed lol, I am bad with computers

Different fonts have different character sets. In Windows you can use the Character Map applet to browse the available selection (Start --> Run --> "charmap"). Fonts such as Wingdings, Webdings, Dingbats, and Symbol have a wide variety of novelty characters. For non-western characters you may have to download or buy special language-specific fonts.
