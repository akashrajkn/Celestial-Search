Firefox page loading problems?
Lately after updating to the latest verson firefox, i'm getting constant page loading errors.  Pages either load real slow or I get "Server not found error".  I've tried everything that I can think of, clearing cache, and the open dns service but no luck.  Internet Explorer works fine and chrome works a little better.  I have Windows xp sp2 and the most recent avast av.  any help would be appreciated.
i don't have a firewall, have avast but its working fine with internet explorer

Your firewall might be blocking Firefox. Check you firewall settings to find out. XD
yes i'm getting that too. Very frustrating. My girlfriend had the problem a few days ago too, but hers seem to have resolved itself. Hopefully whatever bug it is will fix itself soon.
