Im a 12 year old girl and im really bored so I need something to do

http://www.bored.com/
im 13 and i used to go on habbo.com, omegle.com(talk to random strangers but its 100% safe), bored.com, mostfungames.com, fog.com, and addictinggames.com

I prefer habbo most of all
you can also go on youtube and search stuff... haha i dont know...good luck!
ArmorGames.com

Addictinggames.com

Miniclip.com

Youtube.com (I know that this one is pretty obvious, but just saying)

If you are really bored, you can try Omegle.com or Chatroulette.com   
    Basically you just chat with random strangers, but in chat roulette, you actually use a video camera and can see the person. BUT BE CAREFUL. There can be some real sickos that might say and/or do weird and inappropriate stuff on these sites, so make sure to check with your parents before you go on either of those.
