Blocking a number. Will I still be changed by company?
Ok i got a text 'claiming' I'd signed up to some website called 247 sms to get unlimited free text messages for ?4.50 per week. I didn't sign up for this ?_? Anyway, I topped up my phone & this company took ?4.50 straight from my credit. Then they sent me two messages charging me ?1.50 each! On one of the text messages it said to cancel the subscription text this number so I did but they texted me yet again & charged me for the text. They haven't canceled it! If I block the number from texting me will I still be charged by this company?
I texted stop and received a message saying 'You have unscribed + will receieve no more texts. Click here to receive a free ?10 leaving present'

Then they texted me about 2 hours later reminding me I have free text messages ?_?

From what I know of this sort of thing your supposed to phone the text number and text STOP.

If you don't they will keep sending them and charge you for them.

That's why when I get the odd one I delete it straight away. I dont even open it.
