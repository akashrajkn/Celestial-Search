Does anyone know of any free no-ad hosting sites?
I just need hosting for my .com site.  It does not need much, I will only have a couple pages up, no videos or anything so I don't need much space.  It is more of just a landing site with links to other sites like blogs and such already hosted else where.  All I need is a place I can use my .com and a place that does not have any advertisements.

i use webs.com

check out my website. atmods.info
try http://www.thewebpole.com/ where i host 2 of my sites which indeed has a package which provides hosting with out any ads
The best hosting service is Hostgator. Sure it is free. Here is how http://freehostingsites.org/hostgator

Hostgator is perfect especially if you already have your own domain.

Good luck.
Be careful with any free hosting sites. It's better to pay a little bit to be sure you don't waste time with a site that it is blacklisted somewhere. I host all my domains on BlueHost.
