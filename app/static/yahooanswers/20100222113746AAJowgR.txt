Tools/Clear recent history

tools
internet options
privacy
click the always clear my searches on shutdown option.
check the settings to the right of it and make sure things are ticked.
Press CTRL + shift + delete
or go to tools > clear recent history


you can also start private browsing which doesn't remember your search history, usernames etc.
