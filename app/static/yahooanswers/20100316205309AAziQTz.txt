Where can I report a website with someone's personal stuff on it that they don't want seen?
I found a website that has personal pictures of a girl named Emily that someone put up to get payback, and I really want it taken down before she tries to commit suicide! Please help her!

No!

You could report it to the police.

You can't do anything unless you're a hacker. It's an evil world we live in. Report it to whom? The internet police? Let me know when you find them I got a few things I need to get taken off too. Good luck.
Unfortunately, there is nowhere to report stuff like that, unless the pictures are somehow illegal, in which case you could report it to the police, but, generally speaking, due to "free speech" concerns, it's almost impossible to get objectionable material removed from the internet, sorry.

Good luck!... ?
If the picture is disparaging or posting it violates a copyright law or something then you can try to contact the website owner and threaten to sue in court. you can try using one of these services to help you find them:
