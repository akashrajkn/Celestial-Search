do i have to have paypal to buy something on e-bay?
i have a prepay credit card and the card number changes every time i top it up so can i just use the card on its own or do i have to sign up for paypal

paypal is better and a lot safer so try that. good luck
It depends on what the seller accepts. some will only accept paypal. some will allow more kinds of payment.
When it comes to ebay with credit cards, it generally only accepts paypal. check the payment methods as theyre always changing when new ones come out, personally i like to pay by cheque or if its big i pay cash when i go pick it up.
whilst e-Bay recommends Pay-pal, and it is a reasonably safe way of trading, especially with other Non business people, other payment options are often listed.

Most e-bay store will allow credit card payments, private sellers may accept cheques or postal orders.  If you use an alternative you will lose the Pay-pal protection, which is not great but is better than No protection at all.
Yes u need to have paypal..btw dont worry paypal is safe...its best for buyign things online and if the seller scams u u can get ur money back too..isnt that great..

btw i hope i've helped u on this..
thank you
