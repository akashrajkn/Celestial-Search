how to put pictures on ioffer!!!!?
i cant figure out how to put a .jpeg picture as my description. ive seen another listing doing it but i cant figure it out. does someone know how? thanks

1. You first have to create a photobucket account at photobucket.com. Its free.
2. Upload the image to photobucket.com
3. 'share' the image by copying and pasting the html code from photobucket into the html editor of your listing on ioffer.com

There are other ways to do this, but this is how I do it because its easy
if you have anymore questions just ask me: atl_angel000@sbcglobal.net

or, send me a message at ioffer.com cuz im a seller:
