Tabs on internet Explore.. Deleted my fastwebsearch?
This is going to sound like a stupid question, but I was cleaning out my system in the control panel, and deleted a program "fastwebsearch" or something like that, but when I delted it, i lost my tabs on my toolbars that were buttons for fast clicking to get to facebook, twitter, ect... instead of typing each address, i would just click the button and it would go there.. if you know how I can get them back, please help, i know its prob so easy, i just dont know how to do it..  Thank you in advance..
I dont have IE 8

if you have internet explorer 8 click the star beside your favorites that will add websites you like
