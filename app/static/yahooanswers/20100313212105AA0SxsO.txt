Check the settings for it, perhaps it was set to off.
Number 1 you shouldn't leave accounts logged in and Number 2 this can happen a number of ways. The most common is clearing internet History.
did you clear your cookies or cache?
No, most sites don't keep you in forever.  That or you cleared your cache.  There are a number of reasons, none to worry about.
No, it is not bad. It was probably caused by you clearing your cookies or cache.
