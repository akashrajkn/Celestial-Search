saints fc online ticket sales?
im trying to buy tickets for the johnstone paint trophy final and when i try to register with my season ticket i put my season ticket number into the customer number and filled the other two field and clicked register but it says User already exists for this customer.
Please enter your customer number and email
address in the RECOVER PASSWORD section. 
but i have never used online ticket sales.

Well, if you've never used online previously, then you obviously don't have an online account. So you can't enter info in those fields. 

First, register to get an account. Then put the appropriate info in the right places
