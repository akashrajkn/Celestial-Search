is firefox down today?


no
No, not for me at least. I'm using Firefox to answer this right now.
Firefox is a program on your computer it is not a website on someone else's server. Thus it can never be 'down'.
If your Firefox isn't working the fault is on your computer. If you run Windows then use Internet Explorer to browse to the Mozilla site and download Firefox again. Then re-install it.
No.It is working for me.
