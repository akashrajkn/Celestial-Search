Lockerz Z-list Tshirt question?
About 3 weeks ago, i got z-list status, i filled my address and size, but i still havent gotten a conformation email or anything. no sign of anything after 3 weeks. how can i be sure? the deadline to get z-list and get the shirt was yesterday.

You have to wait for a confirmation e-mail.
Lots of people never receive their T-shirts, just like people can't order prizes.. Lockerz is not a very reliable site, they hardly ever have stock and it can take forever to save up enough points to get anything! Try another similar site called Points2Shop.

Whilst completing offers is the primary way of getting points, you can also play games and get referrals net you up to a dollar each (100 points) which you can use to spend on amazon or convert into cash!

Use my referal link to sign up here : http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=Kylehere123

This gets me some extra points and starts you off with 250 ($2.50) of your own! I can help you with anything once you are there! Good luck!
It takes about 4 to 6 weeks. Dont worry its coming.
