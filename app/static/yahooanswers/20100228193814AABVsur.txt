Is form spring free????
I made an account on formspring.com is it free? When i made my account all it asked me was for my email and other stuff such as name. It didn't ask me for any personal info such as credit card or money but on the website it said pricing. Do i have to pay?????????

nah its free just like myspace, facebook, twitter
no, it's completely free.
If what you meant is Formsringme then it's absolutely FREE.

Enjoy!
