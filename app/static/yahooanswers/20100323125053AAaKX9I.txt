It sounds to me like your computer has a nasty case of malware infections.  Likely, there is some malicious program running in the background that is automatically redirecting you to other sites.  I'd suggest downloading Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and/or Spybot Search & Destroy.  Install and run those utilities to clear up the root problem.

Second, quit using Internet Explorer.  Use Firefox instead.  Using Internet Explorer and complaining about problems is like driving a car without a steering wheel and complaining when you run off the road.
