Why don't the internet links i make on Y!A work?
Everytime I put a link in one of my answers, it's blue in the preview but when I submit it and look at it afterwards it's normal grey. Can someone help me it's getting really annnoying!!!

You need to be Level 2 (250 points). Keep answering questions and don't ask too many questions and soon you'll be able to post proper links.
it happens to me aswell, cant explain it. 

but think it's somethink Yahoo have put in, because of all the spam and links to viruses that have been appearing, they've disabled the hyperlinks, but not fully. (as i can get them in a preview or when answering a question, but not on the actual question or answer page)

when putting in a hyperlink (the blue clickable link) it should start with http:// and end with the correct ending, which you are doing since you get the blue link.
It's because you are still on Level 1. When you reach Level 2 that will change and you have another 61 points to go!

It was done to stop active spam links being put up, as most spammers don't get past Level 1 because their accounts are always being terminated.
