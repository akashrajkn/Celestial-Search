how can I purchase items without using Paypal on ebay?


Only if the  seller allows it. If the seller says to use Paypal, that is what you have to do.  Most sellers like it because it is more secure for both parties.

Oops, sorry, I didn't see the "how" in front of the question. 
Check the seller info and see what they will allow. Maybe a credit card.
