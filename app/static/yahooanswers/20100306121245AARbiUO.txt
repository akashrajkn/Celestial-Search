what should i name my blog?
im making a blog that my friends are going to read i will write about random things but all my names sound stupid if you have any ideas please tell me as Many as you can think of for a teen girl.

Play off your name. 

Like if your name is Sydney.... 

Sydtopia. 
Place-O-Syd 
Sydney Street 
etc.... 

Or play off your last name. For example my last name is "Diehl" (pronounced "Deel") and my blog is "The Big Diehl." haha get it?
choose a title that you can easly start a randolm topic about for examle....
i would choose... I AM...

and then start your topic
(I AM...bored
ver well today
So into talking about butterflys)
are you getting this
Make it funny, like "Syd's Junky Blog of Random Crap."

One of my favorite blog titles of all time is at phonymcphonerson.blogspot.com. (Be advised the title does include a curse word, so proceed with caution.) 

Good luck with your blog!
