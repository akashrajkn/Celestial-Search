Can you video chat with a DSL Internet connection?


Depends on the speed of the connection. Probably not 768k, but anything else will be fine.
Yes, as long as your connection is fast enough and it doesn't violate the terms of service of your ISP. Some ISPs don't allow you to use remote conferencing/chatting software, since they consider it telephony.
Yes it is possible but u have the internet speed is upto 1mbps 
also u have good web-cam and the video chating soft,
yahoo messenger 10 is good for video chat
of course you can
