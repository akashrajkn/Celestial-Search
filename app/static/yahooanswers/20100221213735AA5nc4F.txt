how do I fix the back button in firefox? It is there but it does not work. right clicking doesnt work either.?

everything is up to date, i have tried reinstalling it and the backspace trick does not work

That seems pretty odd... have you tried reinstalling FF?.. is it up to date?

ITs not a fix.. but u can use the Backspace key to go back also.
