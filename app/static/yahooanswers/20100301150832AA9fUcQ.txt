If I delete a friend on AOL INSTANT MESSANGER am i still on their buddy list?


Yup, you're still on their Buddy List. If you have your settings on only being able to talk to people on your Buddy List, then the other person won't see you online even when you are online. But your username will still be on their Buddy List, unless they eventually remove you off there. 

Hope I was of help!
