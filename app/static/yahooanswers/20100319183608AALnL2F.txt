Do I need a full install of Firefox?
I can't 'see' some important content of pages - many colors and items just aren't there; perhaps I did something in preferences to screw it up. 
 If I do a full install will it save my bookmarks? Anything else I should know?
Thank you!
Should I save anything? Delete all pertaining Firefox files before reinstalling?
