They are just saying that to scare you, you could well be a man pretending to be a girl for all they know.  Don't worry nothing bad will happen, just be more sensible in the future.
Disconnect from the internet for about 5 years. Spend the next 5 years taking a course in common sense.
They won't do anything to be honest its 1 in a million chance you will get arrested or something. You shouldn't be posting things like that.
The good thing about your post is you're not asking how to "unban" yourself as so many American teens do.  You're obviously mature enough to understand that a site owner has the obvious right to exclude whomever he/she wishes.
Nothing we can do to help.  You simply have to wait and see whether the threat to contact rhe authorities was merely smething to scare you
