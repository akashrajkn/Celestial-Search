System Restore Vista/ Firefox  problem?
Hi I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
-
How do I system restore on Windows Vista [basic home prem]
-
Now my firefox problem..
I scanned my laptop earlier today and there were some tracking cookies so I just went to remove them and I think I removed something that makes firefox work.. It said my firefox was still running and I needed to close it or restart my system, so I restarted my system (I couldn't see the process on task manager either) when I had restarted my system I saw the same message again, lo and behold I un-installed firefox and downloaded it again, I get the same message again? :( Please help.

You're best of posting the second part of your question at http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php
for system restore, open system restore (type system restore into the searchbar on the start menu) and choose a restore point you want to restore to, pick a point that was before firefox quit working.

You could also try uninstalling Firefox again, then delete the folders it leaves behind in C:\Users\ (user name)\AppData\ then reinstall it.

if you are talking about restoring your OS to factory that means reinstalling Vista, use your vista disk or boot from the recovery partition if you have one.
