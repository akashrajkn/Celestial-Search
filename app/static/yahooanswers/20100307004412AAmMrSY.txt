Who is smart enough to help me out here with yahoo explorer??????????????
Ok i was checking my site and it says i have 7 pages and 71 inlinks.. Last week it said i have 6 pages and 78, why did my inlinks go down and how did i go from 6 to 7 pages?

Hello,

There are sometimes users that will add to your pages and that's probably what made them go up, as for your links they might have deleted some or they might have been removed by Yahoo! for any reason.
