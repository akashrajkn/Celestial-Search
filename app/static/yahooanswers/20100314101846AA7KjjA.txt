wireless internet keeps actin up?
every now and then my wireless will not work. It will seem to get disconnected or have like limited access. could it be the actual connection from the company or possibly the router and i need a new one.
change channels?

had this problem for months until i was told to change channels,worked a treat
worth a try.
