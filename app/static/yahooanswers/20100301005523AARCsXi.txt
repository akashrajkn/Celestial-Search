How can I stop firefox tabs going to the end of the tab bar when I close one tab?
Whenever I close one tab, it will go to the tab on the end of the tab bar. How can I just make it go to the next tab?

Thanks

not a clue what your saying
install a free add-on called Tab Mix Plus
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122

Restart Firefox.

go to Tools->tab mix plus options

go to Events->Tab Closing

when closing current tab choose the "focus" setting from the drop down menu

if that doesn't fix it, you may have a conflict from another extension or toolbar
