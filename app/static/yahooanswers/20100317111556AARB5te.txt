Wi-Fi Hotel Connection for a Game Console?
My brother is going to move into a hotel for alittle while and they have Wi-Fi Internet Connection. He plays some online game for the Playstation 2 he uses a Wired Connection right now. His question is can he play his Playstation 2 Online with a Wi-Fi Connection from a Hotel? If so what exactly would he need to do that.

Yep. Your brother needs a device like this one:

If you want to find your own, Google search 'Wireless Ethernet Bridge'

They're pretty easy to set up. Basically plug it in, and go.
