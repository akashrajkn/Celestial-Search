Why won't aim sms messaging work for me anymore?
I've been using it for pretty much as long as i've been using aim to contact people that have aim.  However, today I tried to message someone to their cell phone and it just doesnt work! What happened? Can someone help me out? What can I do to fix it?
It says they're offline. Also they can send me messages and I cant message them back. I can message my AIM contacts perfectly fine.

I'm getting message when I start Messenger that tells me they are updating their system. Doesn't say for how long?...that's why....
