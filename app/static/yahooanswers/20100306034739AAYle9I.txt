Why do most of the FML stories sound fake?
I'm talking about fmylife.com, for the record. It's supposed to have true stories of people's really bad days. Not only are most of them unbelievable, but the mostly follow the same formulas, like

"Today, my boyfriend thought it would be funny to stab me several times. FML"

and 

"Today, my dog relieved himself on my head just as I was leaving the house for my first day working for a Fortune 500 company. There are no showers on the way to work. FML."

I wonder how many real life, less dramatic stories are rejected to publish that kind of stuff on the website.

People are looking for a laugh, and for votes. Some seem real, others just ridiculous anecdotes to get a few chuckles in hahaha
Why? Because it makes it more entertaining, but most of them are too obviously fake and works the other way instead.

My advice? Don't bother with it.
Today, I was supposed to go on a date with a guy I really like. My friends convinced me that he was going to stand me up and that I should just stay home to avoid being hurt. He showed up; I didn't. My friends laughed at my gullible nature. FML

Today, I walked into Mcdonalds to get a meal. I saw the donation box and felt generous so put some money in. Instead of putting a $5 note I put a $100 note. I asked if they could open it to get it back. They didn't have a key. FML

Non-dramatic stories would inevitably be rejected as being dull and of little interest
Well yeah it is to entertain people but i mean they probably dont have a life. I that is pretty funny about that person getting stabbed. Yeah i see what you mean. Good point.
I think that's why FML is so boring. I like ifmurdered way better. You're allowed to make things up because it's your wishes!
