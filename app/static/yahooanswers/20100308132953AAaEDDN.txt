Amazon Prime Trial? Can I sign up and not be charged?
I want to sign up for the Amazon Prime Free Trial, but only for the trial, and not for the $79 annual fee. Will I have to pay if i use the offer during the trial, but choose to not upgrade the trial afterwards?

It will charge you at the end of the free trial. Just make sure you cancel it before it ends and you wont be charged.
