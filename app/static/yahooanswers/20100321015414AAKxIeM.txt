If your talking about getting them turned into a book I would recomend Blurb or lulu. Both allow you to create and publish proffesional looking books. I wrote one for my wife for christmas and she would swear it came from boarders or any other book store. They have good quality

Hmm reading the above post and rereading your question i am thinking I made the wrong assumtion as to what you wanted....my bad
since you like writing, i recommend you enter the NaNoWriMo. Look it up in google. I can't give you a link because I don't know what category to put you in.
