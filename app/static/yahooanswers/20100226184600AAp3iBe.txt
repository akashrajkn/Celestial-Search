Why don't they have a six month premium membership on deviantART?
I want to give my friend one, and want more than three but not as much as twelve...

Well, firstly it is for the money and secondly, maybe they don't think people would stay on it so long etc.
Ask them to offer it.
Buy them a three month premium membership, and then another three month premium membership right afterwards.
