I cannot open FarmVille game. It sais: Server not found  Firefox can't find the server at fb-1.farmville.com.?

I haven't play it too much today since I couldn't open it at all for hours now...I tried to open with safari and firefox and also tried to play it from farmville.com. None of them worked..

You've probably played too much Farmville today.

But the error means that Facebook or Zynga, or your ISP, is having some sort of issue. Try again in a few minutes.
