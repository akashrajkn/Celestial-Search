problem with buying on amazon?
hi i am trying to buy Area 51 on amazon.com i got to the shipping and payment option but when i try to click continue it doesn't make me continue and it says please enter payment options to continue even though i already entered it, please help
@DB nah cause im using a gift card too and its a $10 and area 51 is like $5 and it still doesnt work, but thanks anyway

Okay, I had the same problem, except for me I was using a giftcard and it was because the giftcard didn't have enough money on it for the purchase. So I don't know if that can be the case in your situation.
