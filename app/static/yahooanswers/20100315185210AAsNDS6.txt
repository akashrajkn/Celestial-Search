Limewire and Frostwire are both easy to use and you will find pretty much any content you want on them.
Hi dear I suggest that you try out popular websites like youtube, veoh, metacafe, dailymotion, vimeo, megavideo, facebook video, yahoo video, google video, myspace, ... 

For downloading videos you may use can choose VDownloader (many websites supported) for music, ripping audio, free music, ...
it also helps you to easily convert downloaded videos to mpeg, avi, mkv, mp3, mp4, mov,

Free download it: http://vdownloader.com
I hope this may help you. :)
