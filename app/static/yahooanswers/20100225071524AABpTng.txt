Does anyone know what's up with CompUsa?
I have been trying to visit the CompUsa website for two days now. It simply won't load/open. I constantly encounter "The page cannot be displayed". That only occurs for www.compusa.com. Other sites seem to load normal. Did something go wrong with their site?

It sounds like something is up with your DNS possibly.  I am able to get to their site just fine.

Try going to start -> Run -> type cmd and press enter

type ping compusa.com

If your dns is working properly you should receive 4 Replies.  Otherwise you may need to change your dns server settings or contact your ISP.
I was getting the same message. I've tried, but wont load. Something must be going on with their web server.
