Hi 
    We are talking about the human race here as if you didn't know so anything is possible.
Being someone with a beautiful mind sadly the rest of mankind is not so beautiful in his desires.
so anything a man could dream up is possible.
 from the bizarre to the total depths of depravity are possible on this medium like the internet.or should i say cesspool. which has no controls over it. or police.
however some police forces are trying to stamp out certain practises.
 but the source of some of it comes from sup rising sources like viruses from china. china who wants to stop certain things on the internet should clean up there own back yard first.
