Mobile phone  browser games?

If you want to play games on your mobile phones you can access http://www.mobile9.com/ website, from there you can download and try many nice games which are compatible with your mobile phone (just select your phone type and you will see all available games).
If you want online games, try to search on Google for a preferred game type (there are several flash games available on the Internet). Just Google it.
