Where can i find quality torrents?
okay well recently i downloaded green zone but now it wont let me watch the movie because i need to buy x3 player now i dont want to pay for the player so can sum1 find me a site that allows me to watch green zone without the use of downloading the x3 player?   


thanks in advance

I always use btjunkie.org. You should always read the coments though; if there are any coments to read. They also have a rating system, so you can see if someone reports it as bad. You take a chance if you're the first to download it.
You can watch The Green Zone movie online for free at:
