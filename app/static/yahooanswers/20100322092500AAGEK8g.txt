On Twitter, is there a way to check ...?
Is there a way to check which of the people I am following are following me back? I am currently following about 500 people and only 250 are following me. I want to check which ones aren't following me so that I can either encourage them to follow me, or just unfollow them.
Writing a list would take forever. I want to continue doing this as I gain more followers as well. I need some program or something that can do it for me

Write a list....?
