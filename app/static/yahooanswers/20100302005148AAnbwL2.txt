internet explorer lost i dont know how it get it back?
my computer is in korean language o its little difult as you guys suggest me here before,i try to make shortcut but it disapear plz would you teach me step by step?
lost  back and forward on the tool bar of my acount

start->run->iexplorer.exe
Go to Start>Run and type iexplore.exe then press enter.

Edit: It's iexplore.exe NOT iexplorer.exe and stated by the person above.
The quickest way is to right click on the Task Bar ? Tool Bars ? Select "Quick Launch" 

It will then put a Internet Explorer icon next to the Start button.
