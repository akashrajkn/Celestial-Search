who hates it when an idiot seller keeps the add on craigslist even when it's sold?
just a poll.

it's happened to me more times than i get replys. i mean, how hard is it to remove the add when it's sold?

are they too buisy spending the money? what?

I agree it is frustrating to email someone who is selling something you want just to find out it is sold but the ad is still there. You would think the moron would get a clue, but I think these folk simply Do Not Care...
Totally Agree w/ surfsup I mean seriously why not take the add down, I think its because they figure hey i sold the "item" and now i just don't have to bother taking the sign down because i got what i wanted! 

Or possibly its because they want to see what someone else would have paid or how many other people wanted what they were selling. . .

?
