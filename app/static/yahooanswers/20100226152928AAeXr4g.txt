Where can I download all three of the Fatal Fury movies for Mac?
(1992) Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf
(1993) Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle
(1994) Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture

Does anyone know any website that I can download these for free.
They are pretty old Japanese Anime movies. But still very good.
I also need to download it and to where it can play on my Macbook.
Please help. Thank you.

Sure, find a DVD and buy them.
Vuze might have them.
Just download Vuze and search for them.
You can use http://download-movies-for-free.com
