I'm trying to do a complete site-rip of sites like icanhascheezburger...?
I found a tool called downthemall which will download the images from the page, the problem is that there are 661 pages, is there any way I can add all pages simultaneously or do I have to go through manually...

thanks!
I meant rip all images, not in the strictest sense a site-rip, but more of just ripping all images from the site. maybe a spider program that will go through every page on the site and downloading all jpg images.
I've downloaded 10 page's worth already and it's 3.3 MB. so, for 661 pages it'll probably be about 218 MB, so not much at all mr. negative

gtfo do you know how much bandwidth of theirs that will eat up?
