question about deviantart?
eurgh you're probably going to think im so dumb but i just joined deviant art, and i noticed that after people have commented they are putting something underneath.. which i don't quite understand.

this is one i've just copied as an example

"adorable <3

--
Sleep, dream of a beautiful death. I'll make a promise. Everyting you love...I will destroy."

why do they put that bit at the end? is it like a "motto" or something? lol

easy 10 points<3

That is their signature, which can be anything that you want.
"adorable <3"

(This is the actual comment the '<3' is the symbol for a heart or love. Below the two dotted lines is the users signature)
