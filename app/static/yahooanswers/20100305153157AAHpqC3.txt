How safe is chatroulette?
Im DYING to use it, all my friends say they have soo much fun with it. Its just, there are some creepy people out there! I just tried it for the first time and got flashed hah... it wasnt pretty. So basically, Im just nervous, Im gonna get tracked down by a psycho serial killer & get raped and die. Im just wondering - am I safe as long as I dont give away any personal info?
**so theres NO way of them tracking my ip address or any of that stuff? u sure?

Yes you are safe. The site is completely random. Also about 75% of the time you will be seeing floppy old penis. So if you don't mind it then try it.
