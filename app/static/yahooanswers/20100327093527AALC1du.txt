i forgot my formspring password and got it reset but the email didn't send :/?
how can i get my formspring back?

if you try it again, it will log you out, so try just waiting a little but, or log in with your facebook if you have one!(:
When requesting password or p/w reset,also check your spam folder. I've had mine from reputable websites go to the spam folder by mistake many times.
