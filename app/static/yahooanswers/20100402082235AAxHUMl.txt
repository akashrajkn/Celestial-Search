What is the :3 supposed to be?
I've asked a handful of people, even people who use the smiley, but no one ever knows. This has been bothering me for years now.. what kind of face is :3 supposed to be?

a kitty :/
Its supposed to be a cat!
By itself it's nothing, but if you add this...

<:3, or this...

<:3 )~~~~

it's a simple of more complex mouse. This is the only way I have seen it used.
Its a cat !
eyes with a weird shaped nose
