Why wont this website work for me but it works for others?
Okay so
www.justinbieber.com.au wont work for me on my computer but it works for my friends.
when i try to get on the site it says:
The page cannot be found

But i can get on it on my phone fine except I'm running out of credit so I'm not going on there?

so please if anyone can help me out and tell me how i can access the site please go ahead!
&no comments about justinbieber

I tried it and got "this page cannot be found". 

Perhaps the site is down and you had a cached version on your phone?
