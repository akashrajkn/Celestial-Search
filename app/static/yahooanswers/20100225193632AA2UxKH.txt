Chatroulette.com Question...?
Can I use Chatroulette if I don't have a webcam? Also, I went to the site and it says "click play to start"...there is no play button to push...

Please help if you can!

It's currently down which is why there is no "play" button...you're out of luck tonight!
yeah you can use it even if you dont have a webcam. But it gets annoying too many sick dudes!!
its currently down right now should be up tmrw.
