How to start an ebay account?
OK, so I have this guitar that was given to me, and I'm desperately low on cash... I have no idea what ebay is like, or what to expect when signing up... I don't want to try it until I know what I'm dealing with... so can I please have some human help?

Make an ebay account.
Take a picture of your guitar.
Also what type of guitar is it cause it's a genuine les paul etc sell it for a high price [:
Go to 'Sell' on options once your ebay account is made.
Upload pictures, have a description. What colour, make, etc
Have a minimum bid on it.
Whatever you'd feel comfortable selling for.
Hope it all works out {:
