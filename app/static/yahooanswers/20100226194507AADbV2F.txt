How to stop my wireless router from disconecting me to the internet at random times?
It cuts off at random times, It happens to my toshiba satellite l505d-s5983 laptop with windows 7 os and my ps3, is there any way to stop it

Buy a new one
If it is also happening to your PS3, then you might want to buy a new router. If this doesnt help, then move the router to a different location.  Interference from any electrical device can cause you to loose connection.
