E-bay question regarding a potential buyer that has no history?
This guy is really interested in the cell phone that i am selling, the thing is that he has no records of buying anything before. I heard of scamers where they buy something and pay you but when you send the product to them, they somehow take out the money again. is that true?

As long as they use PayPal you are protected. Just do not ship until PayPal has cleared the transaction.
