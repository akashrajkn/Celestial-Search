Cool and cute Firefox theme?
Hi, i would like to change my standart firefox's themes into a cute theme. I used to use Foxkeh because it is so good, not only it is cute, there's also animated Foxkeh in the corner, and he would running if i'm loading a site. Everybody knows that Foxkeh for 3.6 still unavailable ;_;
i want to change my theme, any good recommendation?? if it is possible, with animation like in Foxkeh

Why not use Firefox Personas?
