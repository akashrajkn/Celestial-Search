how do you set up internet?
I am at my friends for a few weeks and I brought my laptop she told me I could use her internet while I was here. But she doesn't have the kind of internet where you can connect to from the laptop. How can I get her internet onto mine laptop. Is there anyway I can plug her internet into my computer. Her internet modem is called Motorola and we both have PC.

no
