My firefox wont open?
I turned it off last night, turn it on today and it wont open at all. It did it yesterday and i just restarted the comp(3 times) but that didn't work. I do not wish to have to remove and replace firefox if i an help it. help?

What error message do you get? If there is no error message, then uninstall it and reinstall it.

Otherwise deleting your profile can sometimes force Firefox to rebuild a corrupt profile and work properly again. http://support.mozilla.com/en-us/kb/Profiles
