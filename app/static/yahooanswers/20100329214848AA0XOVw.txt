Did u.talk.back scam me?
Is anyone else involved with this website?  I've been a member for over a year I think, and I finally, after SO much time, had enough points to get a $50 gamestop gift card.  I received it today and was really excited, but when I checked the balance online it read $0.00.  Has anyone received a reward from this place?  Has this happened to anyone else?  I've already emailed them, but I'm expecting them to think I'm a liar.  Has anyone gotten a legit gift card reward?  Did I get ripped off?

I heard that a lot of people got scammed by U talk Back. I never used that website. I always go to www.voucherboy.com , good offers and they have a nice option, when you reffer people you will earn points on every survey they complete. Last month I made 1000 points by only referrals :)
I use the site regularly, i even got the amount of points needed and they sent me the $25 gamestop gift card and it worked fine.  It just takes a really long time to get all the points but they actually sent the card alot sooner than i was expecting it, and i used the card with no problems
