ebay feedback question?
dont know if this questions been asked before but for those of you that know, why is it that I have 73 feedback recieved but then next to my name where the star is it only says 64? thanks... :)

if you buy multiple items from one seller, the seller could choose not to leave feed back on everything.
Your feedback score will increase by one per seller (even if you buy 2 or more items from the one seller)  If for example you purchased 1 item one week, paid & received it then purchased another item from the same seller in the next week. Your feedback score will increase by 2 as they are 2 separate transactions. (provided they leave you feedback that is)
