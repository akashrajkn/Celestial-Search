Which sites can "figure out" what country you are in...?
I mean some sites on the net seem to automatically "know" your country when you register, others don't... What does it depend on and can I "fool" them claiming that I'm in, say, US, while in reality I'm in UK?

thanks
ok,then why do they ask your country when you edit your profile??  :/

All sites "know" that.
All sites know which country you are from and can see roughly where you are in that country due to your IP address. 

All sites know which country you are in, but not many actually use the information.
