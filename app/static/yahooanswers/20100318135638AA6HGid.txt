Whats so great about 4chan?
I went to it and it looked like a regular old image board! why is it so popular?

4chan itself isnt so bad, but the sub forum /b/ is really horrible..dont go there..youre eyes will melt off, seep into your mouth and choke you just like your mom choked on my **** last night


thats something someone from /b/ would say
4chan itself isn't so bad, although the massive amount of images uploaded daily is good.  Although there most notorious, and popular, board /b/ (or random) has called the 'asshole of the internet' by encyclopedia dramatica. The /b/ board has no rules, and the people there just try to post the most shocking images or gruesome etc.  /b/ is also responsible for creating many internet memes, such as rick-rolling and lolcats.  If I were you, I wouldn't get into reading /b/, it's effed up.
