Virus...everything is infected???!?
Ok, so I was just on my internet browser and all of a sudden everything on my computer just stalls. Then after i reset my comp this "virus suite" program is scanning my computer even though I have never had this program ever before. Now for some reason whenever I attempt to open any program none of them seem to work and theres a info bubble that comes over this "virus suite" program saying that "this application cannot be executed because that specific program is infected". The other odd part about this is that mozilla still works. If anyone has any experience with this virus, or tips on how I can get around this horrible computer disease it would be greatly appreciated. Luckily I have this macbook which I know I can trust in...
