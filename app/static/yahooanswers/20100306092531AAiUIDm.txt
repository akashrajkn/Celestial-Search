Why is my Formspring.me not showing answers to questions on the profile? :)?
So yah hi guys :)
Why is my formspring.me profile not showing the answers I answered to questions that people asked me?
I answered them and it doesn't show up on my profile :S
Is this happening to other people as well?
Or is this a glitch 
Can someone please help? :)
Thanks in advance :D

same thing is happening to me :) I just answered about 25 questions that i've been asked and none of them are coming up.....
The same thing is happening to me! It's bugging me so bad! Does anyone know why this is happening?! It's probably just a glitch.
It's happening to me too! I was like uhhhh? I think it is just a glitch.
The fucking same thing is happening to me
ugh
o:<
I just answered like 10 questions and NONE showed up...hopefully the answers will show up later?? :/

ps - ask me stuff http://formspring.me/brownie
Same to me. It's server lagg. Should show up within two hours. Your answers and questions WILL show up. No worries (:
It happens to me
But if I go to settings then it will say I have some questions in my in box
And when I go to my in box it says I have no questions
