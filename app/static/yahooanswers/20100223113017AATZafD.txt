Time warner internet vs AT&T internet?
I want to get internet service but not sure which ones to get. I will not be getting Cable TV or Phone just strictly internet. I live in SOCAL Los Angeles area. Time Warner or AT&T ?

If you will be doing a lot of video watching. Get time warner. Time warner is cable intenet and it is much faster than ATT, which is DSL. I've had dsl in the past and now have time warner, there is a big difference. 

If your just going to be using the net occasionally. Not downloading big files or music or watching videos, then DSL is probably better for you as its also cheaper.
