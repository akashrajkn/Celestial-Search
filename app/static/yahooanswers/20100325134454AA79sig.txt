Craigslist? how to know?
How do you know if a person selling is reputable? and not out for your money then not send you anything?

meet the person somewhere around ur area...public place.like gasstation or macdonals..and exchange there..look for a cragslist in ur area .dont go for the once you send money then wait on what you orderd .most of the time its a ripoff
You don't know for sure.  There is no rating system like ebay.

You have to take precautions to prevent being defrauded.  Don't wire money, etc.

Do another search for the same person and see how many places (cities) has the same listing.  If they are very far away then could be something fishy.
That's why Craigslist is face to face. You are not supposed to ship or accept shipments on Craigslist.
Any ad that you reply to where the seller won't deal face to face IS A SCAM and should be reported immediately.

You deal face to face and if the deal doesn't look good, walk away.
