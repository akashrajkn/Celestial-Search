need help with paypal account?
ive made a paypal account, but everytime i go to type my card number in (the 16 digit one along the front) it keeps coming up saying ive submitted this info on another account or something ? but i havent got any other accounts, and this is the first time ive put it all in ? can any one help ?

Time for a phone call to them. 888-221-1161
I would contact paypal, their phone number is on their contact us page.

I had the same thing happen to me recently where I was given the same message, I only have one paypal account, Paypal informed me my card details where on another account ??.Argghhh panic attack!!! Found out my 16 yr old son opened another account in my name! No I didnt kill him....made him suffer by taking his beloved ps3. 

Not trying to scare you, it could be something else. Best to call them.
