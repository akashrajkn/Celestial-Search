Why is my Internet connection slow?
I have roadrunner high-speed Internet with turbo boost (not sure if the last bit matters). Repeatedly throughout the day, I have to reset my connection (both modem and router). My download speed will range from 350 kb until it falls to around 25 kb, upon which I reset the connection. When I'm playing on xbox live after I reset my connection I will host a few games, but after a few hours I will be lagging horribly. I'm looking for help and advice on how I can maintain that high speed I have after I reset the connection. And hopefully improve my overall connection.if there is any other info i need to provide, I will do my best to get it. Any help or advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
I have at most running at one time: two iPod touches, a desktop, and my xbox. Although, I almost never have it all on at once.

do you have more than one computer running at the same time
Busy servers. Lots of people online at the same time.
if is wireless try to move your computer to a better location try not to let nobody use you're computer while you play xbox live i have the same problem i figure it out that while someone was  on my computer using internet and i playing xbox live!! two at the same time doesn't work!!!!!
