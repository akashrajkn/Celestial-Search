I Dont Know Which Web Browser I Should Use?
So far, the web browsers i have used are: Internet Explorer - Was too slow. Google Chrome - I Like It Alot, Very Fast,but slow with online games/apps   Safari 4 - Not as fast as chrome, like the layout 
So, Which one should i use? Which is fastest on xp? Which one is best? Im running windows xp home edition on a Laptop. Please suggest any other web browsers that i would be happy to install if they work well. Thank you for all your help and support.

For browsing use Google Chrome and for downloading and playing game use

mozilla firefox ...............

Plz dont' forgot to rate
In my opinion firefox is the best browser by far with all the extensions extras and custimization its the best browser!!!!!!!
I say stick with Google chrome. I had all of the  other browsers you could imagine. In my opinion Google Chrome stands out. It's faster, reliable, simple, and unique.
The one I use my self Is Firefox but depending on the amount of ram u have. I would suggest to either download a free program called (Free RAM XP Pro) or go with Google chrome.
It all depends on what you like best. Internet Explorer will most likely have the least issues because it was designed specifically for Windows, and is also the safest in terms of malware. Firefox has a memory issue that some users expeirience that can easily freeze a computer, and so far there is no officially supported fix. Chrome is still in its early stage which means all the bugs are still being worked out. I myself would recommend Internet Explorer 8 or Opera 10.51.
