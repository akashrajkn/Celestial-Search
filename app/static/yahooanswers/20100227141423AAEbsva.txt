I'm trying to create a formspring account, please help?
When creating an account i filled in all the information and checked the Agree To Terms box and everything (username password, etc) was accepted.  But, when i click "finish" it takes me to a blank page. I have tried on another computer and have tried refreshing the page and it doesnt work, any suggestions? Thanks (:

that is weird. i have had things like that happen to me
It's the website.
It does that to me all the time.
Try making one in a few Hours.
