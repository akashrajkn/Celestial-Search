Help with twitter! Finding celebs seems impossible.?
Okay, so i am totally addicted to twitter now. (follow me: lindsea323) And I want to follow some celebrities on twitter. I try to type in the celebs name in the "find people" bar and it always says "no one with this name" help!

A great site to find celebs is http://wefollow.com/ Hope this helps!
Haha. I had the same issue. You could go onto a website like:

http://twittercelebrities.org/
http://www.famoustwit.com/

or you could do what I do, and search "______ ______ Twitter" on yahoo, and it will give you the link. Make sure it's a verified acount though. You don't want to be following a poser :]
