how to steal a blogger template?
i am trying to get a template off of someone's blogger, and i clicked view source, but i don't know where to start and stop copying? i tried to copy and paste the whole thing but it said it wouldn't save the template. help?

you're kidding right?
I know if I worked hard at developing my site, it would piss me off if someone just came and stoled my hard work!

try this option, there's many places you can get them for free without having to STEAL:
go to Google and type these keywords: free blogger templates
and there you go ALL LEGAL.
