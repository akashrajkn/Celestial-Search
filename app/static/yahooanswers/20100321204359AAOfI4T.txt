Has anyone actually used www.oohilove.com?
I saw an ad for the site www.oohilove.com its one of those auction sites that start bids below a dollar with expensive items. I thought about signing up but it seems pretty unreal to me. Has anyone used it and had success? or Any opinions on these sorts of sites?

NO BUT IN ORDER FOR THOSE SITES TO GROW THEY ACCEPT MANY COMPANIES TO ADVERTISE AND MANY OF THOSE READY TO INSERT A TROJAN ON YOUR COMPUTER BECAUSE THAT SITE AS NEW I BET CAN AFFORD HIGH SECURITY TO THEIR SERVERS!    SAY YOU LOVE MASTERUDY SAY IT LOUDER!
