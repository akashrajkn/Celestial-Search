Is PriceAngels a trusted/good website to buy Nintendo DSi flashcards?
Okay, for people that don't know what priceangels.com is, price angels is a website were you could buy cheap but very cheap stuff. From ds flash carts, to ipod cases, to screen protectors. I think its exactly like dealextreme.com For people that don't know what dealextreme is, it is almost the same thing. The only problem is that dealextreme doesn't sell DS flash carts anymore. I wanted to buy one but  they didn't have them. I searched and found this website which is priceangels.com. They have them. So I bought one but i dont know if it is a good/ trusted site. I never bought something from it. IF YOU HAVE PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION!!!!! THANK YOU!!! :)

A friend of mine ordered and it didn't arrive for weeks! Ordered mine from thumbninja.com and it turned up in a few days.

It should show up eventually but if you want fast delivery its better to pay a little extra for a site with cards in stock!
