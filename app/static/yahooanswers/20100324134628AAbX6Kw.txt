i had a foo pets account. then i changed my e-mail. now i can't log on. HELP !?
when i was on foopets ( online ) i went to profile because i didn't know my e-mail WAS going to be private.
so i changed my e-mail to something random... and now i can't remember what it is to log back on !
please help ! i love my foopet very much .
~thanks

Maybe you can set up another account?
