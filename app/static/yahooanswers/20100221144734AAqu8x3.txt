How do you zoom in on safari internet explorer?
the text is so small is there a way to zoom in on Safari Internet Explorer

first decide what browser you're using. What kind of computer are you using. Holding the Control button and scrolling up with the scroll wheel is one way. command + is another way. or go to view-zoom-in
Internet explorer:
Hold down the control (CTRL) key and roll your mouse wheel or press the + key.
To embiggen the text in Safari, hit Apple-+ until it gets to a size you like. in Internet Explorer I'm fairly sure you can do the Windows equivalent Ctrl-+.
