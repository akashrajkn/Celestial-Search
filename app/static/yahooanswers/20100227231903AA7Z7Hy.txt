Download avi from mediafire but after download it's in txt format?
I know there is some catch to this...please help
there's many parts to this video

Rename it to .avi
check for a media converter. you'd be surprised at what I found can be converted into another format and still work.

Or what that guy above said.
What size is the file you have downloaded?

Try renaming it and putting .avi at the end of the file name
thats because your stealing files and they have put a dummy file up so you can get infected with viruses

its been happening all over of late
