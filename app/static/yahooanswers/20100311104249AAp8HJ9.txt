on ebay auctions, when bidding has finished if i find the bid too low do i still have to sell?


Yes-  if you're worried about it, you are supposed to set a Reserve Price, but that deters bidders.
No.. You don't have to sell.
yes you do - if you have a minimum price you want to sell the item for you should set a reserve price or just use the buy it now option instead of the auction
Yes, when you put the item on ebay, you are agreeing to a binding contract. If you were worried about the sale price, you should have set a reserve price, which would mean you wouldn't have to sell unless they matched the price you wanted. 

Contact the bidder and tell them your problem, chances are they will understand.
The more you sell. Hopefully your average profit increases.
Yes. I guess you could cancel the item but you would get bad feedback. If you want a certain amount for it start the bid at that price, buy it now or set a reserve price.
According to eBay policy you are obligated to sell the item to the winner of the auction regardless of the price (that's the main point for an auction isn't it?). 

However, you can obviously cancel the transaction and not sell the item to the highest bidder. The bad side to this is you might have a negative feedback (which is very likely). 

If the price is too low for you and you don't really care much about your reputation on eBay then you might want to go ahead with the second option.
