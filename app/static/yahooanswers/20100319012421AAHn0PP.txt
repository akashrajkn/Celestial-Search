How do I check my internet download speed?
I don't want speedtest.net because I don't think it's reliable. So will someone give me the link for a site.

There are tons of speed testing sites here.

This one is usually the most accurate for me.

Always remember that these tests are what give you actual download/upload speeds. The ones your internet Co advertises to you are per second speeds.
