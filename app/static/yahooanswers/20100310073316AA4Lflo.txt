im new to lockerz and....?
i was wondering why is it that everythings "coming soon" when can i look and also how can i get more points quick? i want a game :)
premium how about .... no! :D what do you have a vendetta against lockerz cuz you were too late and didnt get there in time to get your things you wanted :( awww

that "coming soon" will last forever until you don't see that lockerz is scam page. nobody gives you something for free. i have over 300 points and i am z-lister. i didn't get anything.there is no z-lister t-shirt.beleive me they will not give you anything.if you want some game go and buy it with your own money. :)
Lockerz is not a scam, and the "coming soon" will go away on 1 day of each month. The one day of each month is called Redemption day. Soon they will be 24/7, but, they will be multiplying the cost of each item by 4. Coming soon simply means that redemption is soon.
