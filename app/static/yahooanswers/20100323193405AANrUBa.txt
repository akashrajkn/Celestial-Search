What's an online journal-like site? (without having to code all the HTML)?
I'm just looking for an easy-to-use site that I can post feelings and/or pictures, and not have to deal with all of the complicated HTML. I find that sites like Bloggr and MySpace are too complicated for my use. I enjoy Facebook but I can't post all my feelings or thoughts onto their statuses or notes.

TUMBLRRRR! FRICKIN SIMPLE. just install themes. 
Or Livejournal. :D
twitter?
blogspot.com
You should give Mabame.com a try. It's very easy to use. You can enter journal posts and pictures. Your journal and album are private by default, nobody can find or look at them. However, you can decide to invite friends and family to view and comment on your journal/album. It's up to you.
