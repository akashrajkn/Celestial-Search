Can anyone recommend a good adult webcam company to work for?
I've been looking into livejasmin.com and onhercam.com. I want to only do non-nude and maybe flash my boobs but no vag. I know that there are a lot of trashy girls that work these companies and I just want to work for a company that pays well (higher percentage payout) and has a lot of traffic at their site. I know some of them require approval, I'm 27 years old 5'7" 125 lbs.

If anyone has any other recommendations for other sites please let me know. Also, any tips from webcam girls are greatly appreciated. =) Thanks!
For people who like to judge: I have applied for all of the jobs in my local newspaper and every online job search engine available. If it's a choice between having my electricity shut off, being homeless, etc. then I will do what I have to do. All moms would probably do the same if they had no other option.

If you don't have a real answer - don't answer!

I think I just answered one of your questions and sent you a link to livejasmin. All sites that I know of will require approval. When looking for sites with high traffic I think LJ is the way to go. They aggressively market their sites and have an aggressive network of affiliates sending them a lot of traffic.

There are also sites like myfreecams.com where you can get tips from viewers in the free chat areas, but it's very hard to get a private chat and most of the viewers seem to be people begging for a free peek. On MFC you'll also be competing with a bunch of models who get completely naked in the free area, so it would be hard to compete with them just doing a flash here and there.
