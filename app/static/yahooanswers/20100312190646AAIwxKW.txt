how to download windows 7?
i hav a laptop and i want to download windows 7 to it i already bought windows 7 and hav a product key but my laptop doesnt have a disk drive. is there a way to download it another way                              free legal

LOL. No. You will have to buy an disk drive with a usb
Use an external CD/DVD drive.  Downloading Windows 7 is illegal and you wouldn't be able to install it like that anyway.
oh i hate laptops without dvd drives. 

But luckily theres a solution. It will require more purchusing thou.

What you need is an usb external dvd writer. These arn't to expensive but depends where you buy them.
you should be able to buy them from any good eletronic or computer shop

there are ways to downlaod them online but it's highly illegal and i wouldnt recommend it. Getting the usb  DVD drive is a lot easier and safer.

i hope this helps
Well the only way to do this would be to contact microsoft since you bought a product key and can't install it call 1800-microsoft
