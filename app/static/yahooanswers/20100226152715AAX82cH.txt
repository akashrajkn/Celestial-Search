How do I delete all my recent book marks in firefox?
I never use the recent bookmarks thing, I always bookmark websites by accident. I thought it was okay because only about 10 show up when I view the recent bookmarks. After importing my bookmarks from firefox to chrome chrome had every freaking single bookmark I've accidentally clicked over 2 years.. There were 100s! Well almost..

I know they're hiding somewhere and I can't delete them the way I'd delete normal bookmarks.. What do I do? Is there a bookmarks folder somewhere that I can delete?

i actually dont know
Delete the whole browser,firefox is a resource hog that makes your computer run like molasses.
