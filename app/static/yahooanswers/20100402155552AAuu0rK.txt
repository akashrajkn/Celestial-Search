What is a Proxy and how do I get rid of it?
Okay..I go to this site all of the time, and just recently I clicked and it said "No proxies allowed." How can I get back onto that site? I just want step by step instructions...not a whole explanation about what those dang things are.

Its not something you get rid of.

In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application program) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. 

Seems like you may be confused?
