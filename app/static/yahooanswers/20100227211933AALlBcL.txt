When can you redeem prizes on Lockerz.com? How do you redeem prizes at PTZ Place?
I'm hoping to get an iPod Touch. I only have 100 ptz. When i click on Redeem, and click on electronics, all the products says MORE SOON. what does that mean? Also, am i only allowed to redeem prizes only on Member Appreciation Redemptions and General Redemptions?

You can only redeem prizes on lockerz during one of their restocks usually near the end of the month. They'll say when they restock. When they restock the prizes go FAST so you have to be ready to redeem what you want fast. when it says more soon it just means they have none in stock.

Also if anyone reading wants an invite email me at facemonger24@yahoo.com and ill send you an invite. :)
