Any way to find an online friend gone MIA?
Got an online friend, been talking almost weekly (chat) for quite a while now, and last I hear he was recovering from a surgery and now his and his daughters facebook pages are GONE and his email is kicking back non-deliverable. Is there a way to find a real person that does not involve a PI or massive telephone calling to strangers? I know his name and state and that is about it as far as personal info goes (it was on his facebook page so I didn't think to memorize more). Seriously worried about him.

There's a problem here.

We don't know if you are:

1. A nice friendly concerned person.

or

2. A crazed stalker with a big butcher knife.

See what I'm saying?

So I'm sorry I can't give you any tips. I apologize if you really are a nice friendly concerned person.
Friends and others can be traced, either by using the Salvation Army or missing persons bureau. You sound like you're from the US so I would look in a local (to him) newspaper or phone-book to find out where he may be. There may be a chance that the local police or doctor may also have news. Salvation Army are usually the best at this though, especially if you want to do it anonymously. Another trick is to just Google him and see what comes up. That worked with me, an old pal I hadn't seen for 20 years Googled me and we ended up getting back in touch. Good luck.
I wonder if he's blocked you.

If you get blocked on facebook their names wont show up if you look them up.

I imagine that if your e-mail messages come back non-deliverable then that means he's blocked you from that as well.
