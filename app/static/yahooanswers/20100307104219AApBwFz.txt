can you reply to person repling your add through craigslist?
The reason I ask I have posted adds and people ask dumb questions about your add that aren't really important to your add. And then you never here from them again which I know ends up being a scam cause the next thing you know your getting emails with nothing but spam crap. The reason is I am not to bright and I reply using my email. Can you reply to someone's add through craislist without using your own email? Please don't laugh at my question.

yes. make a new email with a stupid name like (fake_email999@yahoo.com) and then copy the repliers email adress and send an email to them using the new email.
