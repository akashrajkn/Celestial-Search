Don't bother paying for antivirus software.  I have used about five different payed ones, and none of them are as good as avast!, which is free.

Norton and McAfee are actually very weak anti-viruses. They fail to pick up deeply hidden spyware/adware etc. Plus, you have to pay for it. I would look into Avira or Microsoft Security Essentials. They both provide great protection and don't hog your computer's resources when they run. I'm not so sure about the anti-virus you bought, but I'm a pretty heavy computer user and the two anti-viruses I mentioned are great.
I have not used F-secure, but considering that you already have it, it is probably an OK program.

Now, if he let you use his license, that is stealing, and I recommend you install a free anti-virus program. Microsoft Security Essentials is a very good anti-virus program from Microsoft that does not slow down your computer. You may download it at http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials
