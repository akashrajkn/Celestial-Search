you might not wanna click on it just saying.

It could be real but most likely they are just trying to get you to sign up for something.  It could also be a site that gets you to click on the link and than gives you a virus.  Be careful.

So I was curious and clicked on it and it is a page created by some immature guy who is showing pics of his ex - gf but still looks like the front page is a teaser to try to get you to pay.

Reality:  Lauren and Ben prob really don't exist.
