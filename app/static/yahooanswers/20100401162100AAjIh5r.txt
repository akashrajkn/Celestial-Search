How to use a proxy server?
Can anyone direct me on how to find, and use, a proxy server that will make it more difficult to track my IP address?

Can, or should, I use a proxy server to download movies from Ares? If so, how do I go about doing that?

Just go on this website:

http://www.anonsafe.com/

And browse the internet from there.

As for Ares, I dunno, sorry.
