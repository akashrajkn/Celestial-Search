helping finding an internet card?
so im looking for a card that gives my laptop or mobile device internet.  not like free wifi spots or not like a wireless card adapter.

i mean like you plug it in and you have internet.  i know it costs money but which carrier has this?

This think you are looking for is named USB Modem and you can buy one from any internet Co. anyway nowadays the speed is 3G so your internet will be as fast as a cable connection might not be form the same country as you but i can suggest you: T-Mobile,Vodafone,RDS,Orange and One.
