I'm searching for random best...things. Is there such a site?
Is there a site where people can post any knowledge they think is great to have. And other people can rate the posts on how great the knowledge is. 

hmm, how to make this really clear..
For example:
I find a great way to learn how to play guitar, and want to share that technique. I can post it on that site and my technique will be rated.
But also when I find a very useful piece of software, or a very beautiful picture, a great restaurant in hawa?, anything. 
I guess I'm basically looking for a site that rates the entire internet.

I think this is the site you are looking for. Registration is free, add the details of what you find interesting to begin.
