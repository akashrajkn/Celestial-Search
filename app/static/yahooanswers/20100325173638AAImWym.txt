Is there a site that you can make your videos private, but viewable on another site?
I have a loyal fan base on YouTube that have said they love my videos, So I was thinking about having a website that has all my videos,  but is there a website that you can upload videos on, that can be set to private, so you can only see them on my site?

I have tried it with YouTube and it does not work. It would be pointless to have the videos public, so you could see them on YouTube and my site.

You are better off starting your own website. Yahoo has several hosting plans that could work well. This way you can control all of the content and user base.
