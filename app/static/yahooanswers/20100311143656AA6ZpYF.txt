How much does internet "cost"?
I don't mean how much do ISPs (internet service providers) charge us, but rather what is the cost for them to provide internet?

I figure since most North American ones tend to be routed in phone companies, they already have plenty of servers, and running them can't trully cost anything near what people pay per month, so what's the markup?

depends on what company you choose its usually around 80-200
I have AT&T extreme 6.0 their fastest speed. It runs 42 bucks per/month.  they have three or four different plans, their cheapest is 19.95, which is just a notch above dialup. I might also add that my extreme 6.0 is regular 47 bucks, by doing a bundle package I save 5 bucks.
