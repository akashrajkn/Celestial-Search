Should I start tweeting?
i'm trying to decide whether or not i should start tweeting again? what is ur assessment on Twitter?
1) Random Blathering
2) Substantial Conversation

p.s. i already have a myspace, facebook, and two email addresses

Depends on what you are tweeting for...

Are you trying to increase your online exposure?
Are you trying to use Twitter as a promotion platform for a business?
or
Are you just tweeting similar to the way you SMS?

If it's like an SMS then like me you may not find it of any use to you.

If it for any of the other reasons then you might like to consider starting again and also check out the information I have on TopRanked Website.com.au see reference link below.
Both really!
I like to randomly blather on about stuff, but i also like talking to the lovely people I meet on twitter.

It's fun, there's some nice people on there.
