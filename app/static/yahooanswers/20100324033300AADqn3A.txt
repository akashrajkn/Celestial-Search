You cant control the download speed unless you are using a torrent or some download manager. AFAIK download speed of Internet Explorer cant be controlled
netlimited is wonderful application.
its not free but then u can try it.
Stuart is most probably right, but I can't help wondering why.  Never seen such a question before
Your download speed is determined by the speed of your ISP. Cable internet, dial up, broadband etc.
If your Downloading Speed varies, then try TCP Optimizer otherwise Net Limiter
