What do I do if my ISP blocked torrents?
I used torrents only for downloading games.But now,I found that the torrents don't work anymore and my friend told me that our ISP blocks the use of torrents.Is there a way to fix this without my ISP knowing them?
Really? Ahh..too bad,I do love playing games.Guess I gotta forget about them.

Uh, no. Your Internet Service PROVIDER will know whatever you're doing. Either get a different ISP or deal with not being able to do illegal downloading.
It's because they're illegal.

I surely hope you get caught. :]
First off, torrents are not illegal. Some of the content being shared through torrents may be copyrighted, but torrents themselves and a lot of the content out there is not illegal.

You can try to use a proxy site for downloading. Google "free proxy servers" and try that route. Your ISP will only see http traffic.

FYI, I would also be wary of warez sites as they will infect your machine faster than you can blink.
