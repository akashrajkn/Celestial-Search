Social Network for my Kids?
Please give me your suggestions.

for any social network you are going to have the problem of online predators but most sites have a lot of features to prevent that. On facebook you can set everything to be seen only by friends. If your kids make sure they only add people  they know then they should be relatively safe. They would still also have to be careful of what fan pages, groups, and applications they join!
My kids have been using this site called Kidswirl for about a year now. They love it and I feel like they are safe on it. I know there are other sites out there too.....but Kidswirl.com seems to be the best one! They were also mentioned in a CNN article that I read on "Social Networking for Kids". Pretty cool.
