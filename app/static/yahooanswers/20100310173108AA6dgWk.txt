How to delete browsing history in internet explorer?
Ok, so I my friend decided to look up porn on my computer and I don't want my wife to freak out. I deleted all the history, changed the settings, etc etc. However, when I click the down arrow in the address bar, some porn sites show up and won't go away. i've also clicked the X next to them and they disappear only to reappear the next time i start IE. What's up with that and how do i get rid of it?

Also, it doesn't show up anywhere in my history or anything, just right there in that 'auto-complete' box. For now I have auto complete turned off, so it won't show up, but that only temporarily covers up the problem. Some help please? And don't direct me to a site to buy/download software.
The thing is, I deleted everything. Ctrl+Shift+delete and deleted temps, cookies, etc...deleted auto-complete files, cleared all history and everything. I know my way around most of this stuff, but I'm stumped as to why this will not go away. Any clue as to why?
I even reset ie settings to default because it was supposed to restore all original crap, and guess what? it's still there. this is too weird. help

Go to tools see the drop down menu click it  then  check delete browsing history.
That's it at least on i.e. 7.0

Otherwise there is a way to go into control panel and there is a spot to delete history delete cookies .
Depends on your operating system.
