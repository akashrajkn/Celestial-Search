mobile broadband confused on what to do!?
Ive got an apple ibook g4,can I use the mobile internet dongles with this?
Also at the mo Ive got virgin media broadband M and tv L package,the broadband is ?20 a month with this.Ive just ordered a wireless router which was ?40 and going on my next bill,Ive just been thinking about it and thought maybe its worth just going mobile broadband instead?If Idid how much do you think I would need?I'm on the net alot but dont really watch videos and I never play games,just generally surf,email,facebook that kind of thing.
ta!

Move to mobile broadband if you think it will be useful.
