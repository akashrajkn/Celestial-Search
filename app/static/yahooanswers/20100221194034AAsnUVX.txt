Can't sign into lockerz.?
every time i try to sign into lockerz it says, "you have been logged out please sign in".  What is wrong.

ive had that prob...close internet and try again it works for me
typing in the password incorrectly?
Might be server problems, but try erasing all history from your browser, and logging in again.
If this does not work, the only solution is to wait, or ask info@lockerz.com
