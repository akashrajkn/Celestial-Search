Use a reverse phone lookup. Most will make you pay to view results. The number appears to be in the directory at http://www.phonerecordsdirectory.com/uk/?id=ph but they want to charge $29.95 USD for a 1 year subscription. If it's worth 20 quid for a shot at an answer (no guarantee it'll be the one you're looking for) then give it a go.
