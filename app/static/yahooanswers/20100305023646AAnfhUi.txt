What site can I find this?
Hi, do you know any site that can give me tips on creative writing and where I can also post my stories, poems, and everything else?

Thanks so much. :)

Hi there.
I have a good place where you can get started. Write about a hast of topics, be creative, stats about how many readers you have, earn points, you can even earn a little bit of money through royalties.
Just follow the link and sign up - it's very quick and free.
Very clean and easy to navigate site. Text editor, upload pictures, save drafts online - more than your average blog.
