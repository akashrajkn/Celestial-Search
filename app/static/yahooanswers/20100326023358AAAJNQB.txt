Blogger/Blogspot users -- How do you get your blog seen by people?
I created a blog on Blogger and I'm confused how anyone could see my blog, besides the Google blog search. There really isn't anything on Blogger where users could come across my blog.

First of all, if you are serious about your blog, you should really spend the money and purchase your own domain name. This will increase the likelihood of you blog being seen through search engine queries. 

Here are some other suggestions on how to stimulate traffic;

-Post links (your url) to your  blog on social sites such as Facebook and Twitter
-Post your articles to social bookmarking sites like stumbleupon, digg or bookmarkarticles
-Add a live feedjit widget to your blog
-Add links to your blog by commenting on other bloggers work, usually in the same niche as your own
-Add your link to you signature (emails, forums, etc)

These are just some examples, but the biggest tip I will give you would be to think outsite the box and be creative. Ask yourself where you would search if you wanted to find information on the topic you are writing about and then go there and post your link. 

Good luck with your blog!
people already see you here. post the link of your blog onto your profile page.
You need to get some links to your blog.

Comment on other peoples blog posts and link up to your blog.

Google will find your blog once you have links pointing back to it.

You should also do some self promotion, get your blog out to your friends and get them to send it on to their friends etc as well.
