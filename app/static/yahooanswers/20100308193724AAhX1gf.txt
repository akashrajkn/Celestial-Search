Why is it that forums and message boards are full of snobbish, bitter, angry people?
And this means any forum that I go to. Even the Ultimate-Guitar and GameFAQs forums. One day, I posted a topic about my brother's opinions, and guess what? Almost every poster there flamed my brother. And me. Also, other people there who posted their own opinions got their flames.

I said. "I don't deserve to get flamed here, that opinion is not mine!" but they still said, "you do, because you posted it."

It seems like no matter who makes that post, these angry people just won't stop making any degrading comments about them.

Why don't people get along well on forums such as these? Why don't they just say things respectfully?

That would be due to John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.
