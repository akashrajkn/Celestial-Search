Is it just in Spain or is the web http://www.freeexampapers.com down?
I'm now preparing my IB Final Tests, which are in May, so I have a little more than 30 days. I have always downloaded past tests from freeexampapers.com to see how they look like and train for the real ones. And today the webpage is just not working, the server is down!! Please help me, maybe in some countries it is still up and I can bounce myself there through proxy to get access.

Here it is down!
i guess its just in spain because it works where i live
that site banned your country ip addressess 

but you can use proxy to access it again like http://cl0ak.info and http://bypassall.blogspot.com
