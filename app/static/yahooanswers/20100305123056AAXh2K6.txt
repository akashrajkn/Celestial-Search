What do you think of the virtual world of Blue Mars?
Has anyone been on the new virtual world of Blue Mars?  www.bluemars.com.  What do you think of it?  Will it make it?  Why would someone want to check it out?

It looks pretty, but unless you have a supercomputer, good luck having any sort of a smooth experience.

I recommend checking out this site.  It lists a bunch of options with reviews (including Blue Mars) so you can choose what works best for you!  Enjoy!
