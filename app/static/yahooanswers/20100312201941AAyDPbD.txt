Is what they said true?
Ok, this is really bad. I was looking at pornography, and I clicked on a link that I thought was teenage porn. But then it says, "Thanks for visting. Your address is being traced and agents will contact you shortly to convince you that you need to have better morals." and stuff like that, and I was wondering if agents will come and visit me? I know I sound like a creepy idiot, but I'm really quite scared.
Please, no stupid answers.
Thanks!

probably not. if this were real they wouldnt warn you
Probably nothing to it, but just to be sure, I wouldn't visit those sites anymore......Good luck!
No its just people screwing with you. How are they gonna know where you live?
Awe poor you. I can imagine having that happen to me.
But no, there are millions of porn. sites out there, if they were illegal they wouldn't be up.

So if it's not illegal what reason would someone send agents out? Surely not to convince you of better morals.

No don't worry about it no one is going to visit you, in fact unless you've committed a crime I do believe tracing computers to people's homes, is in it's self, illegal. Therefore the agents would get in trouble :P
what did the sceen look like when you clicked there.you can sometimes tell if it's cheap or not.
