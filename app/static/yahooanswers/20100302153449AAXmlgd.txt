how can i view my webcam at home on my phone when i am at work?


You'll need a webcam with its own ip address. they are available but are expensive. You could also use software that lets you run your PC remotely such as Gotomypc.
Haha, trying to spy in on the wife, huh? Well here... http://www.eyespyfx.com/index.htm it's a trusted site but I haven't got to try the product yet, so... Yeah
