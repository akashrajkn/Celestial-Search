What is Peerguardian and if i use it can my internet provider still see what i'm downloading?
I've been trying to find a way to download files from web sites like the piratebay without my internet provider catching me (i know that i am on the watchlist so i have to be careful) and one solution that somebody has given me was Peerguardian. Can anybody explain how it works and how safe i will be if i use it?

Peerguardian is capable of blocking incoming and outgoing connections based on IP blacklists. The system is also capable of blocking custom ranges, depending upon user preferences.

lt basically prevents the government seeing what you're downloading, as well as your ISP.

My friend said it's pretty safe, he has recommended me to use it but l'd rather prevent downloading things of Torrents altogether because my brother does it for me instead. :P
When anyone downloads files, their Internet provider will see what they download. But it may not be seen by other organizations, I mean RIAA and MPAA.I prefer beethink ip blocker as an alternative of peerguardian, which is compatible with windows 7 64 bits, faster and more stable.
