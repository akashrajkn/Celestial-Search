Hello Viewer's. I want to buy wireless USB modem for Internet Usage. Which service providers are good in?
providing good speed? Any one knows where can I find shops in bangalore so that I can get details ?

airtel is the best...
then contact your local ISPs and speak to them
The answer depends on your locality. I travel across India and I am using Tata photon+. I am fully satisfied with it. If you mainly stay at bangalore then this one is very good. You can also try reliance netconnect which is equally good. Do not go by the ads, check the speed of each using speed test of speakeasy. You can find it in the web site http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest .
Reliance is best, i m using it in my laptop.
