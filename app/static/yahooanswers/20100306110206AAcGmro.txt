Is ventones.com a free website?
i've been using ventones.com for ringtones.  it says its totally free but is that true?
oh yeah i have unlimitd texting and i only use the audio text that it sends, not the website URL.

The website itself is free, but you may be receiving charges from your wireless carrier every time you upload a file to your phone. Check with your provider.
