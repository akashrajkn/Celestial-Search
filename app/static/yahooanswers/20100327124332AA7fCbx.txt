What does this horoscope mean ?
The sum of the relationship is made up of careful attention to its parts. Sometimes you just want to overturn everything and start anew, but don't toss out the baby with the bathwater. Pay attention to the here and now.

I guess i kinda get it but can someone kinda put it into normal person language Lol
Thnx , and no rude answers saying its a dumb question pls

IT MEANS THAT A RELATIONSHIP IS ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT YOU PUT IN IT LIKE COMMUNICATION AND TRUST. IT GOES ON TO MENTION THAT JUST ENDING THE RELATIONSHIP AND STARTING A NEW ONE DOESNT REALLY SOLVE ANYTHING BECAUSE THE SAME MISTAKES WILL BE MADE AGAIN. SO THE ANSWER IS NOT TO RUN FROM THE PROBLEMS BUT WORK ON THEM THEN YOU WILL SEE IF ENDING THE RELATIONSHIP IS THE RIGHT MOVE. DONT END IT BECAUSE IT IS HARD, YOU MAY THROW AWAY A SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE PROCESS. FOCUS ON WHAT IS GOING ON NOW NOT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HERE AND NOW LAYS THE GROUND WORK FOR THE FUTURE AND IF PROPER ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO WHAT IS GOING ON NOW THE FUTURE WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. I HOPE THIS HELPS, I KNOW ITS A BIT WORDY.
