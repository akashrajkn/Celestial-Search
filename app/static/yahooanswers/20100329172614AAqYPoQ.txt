When IM'ing between the Southern & Northern Hampshire's could there be disruptions due to the distance as ..?
Opposed to IM'ing with in the same hemisphere ?

 EX : like from Brazil To North America ?
 Any advice or a link to help me would be greatly helpful .

Thank You , All

If a link that's great & happy Eve , Friends

if there were any delay, it would only be in the range of 32 milliseconds, possibly as much as a second on a poor connection; in other words, there would be next to no noticeable difference.
No. It doesn't matter whether they're in the northern or southern hemisphere. It matters what each person's connection is.
There shouldn't be any disruptions, no. Distance and connection speed determine how fast it takes for a message to go from one computer to another, and as you're IM'ing, then even a small delay won't be noticable.
nope
Not real sure about it. They may be affected in much the same way dead zones affect cell phones.
I don't think so. I am in the Eastern US, and I've IM'ed with people in Australia and New Zealand with no problem.
