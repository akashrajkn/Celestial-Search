Do you have to uninstall Internet explorer if you want to try Firefox?
I have IE on my computer and want to try FF. I have windows vista. can i just download ff?

Yes.

 @ Not 2 B fooled: I meant that yes, she can just download it.
I run both Safari and Firefox.
You don't need to uninstall IE.
You need not uninstall IE. You can install any number of browsers. I am having FF, 
GoogleChrome apart from IE.
Sorry, Alice, but they can be on the same computer and even running at the same time - I do it daily with my PC
You can have as many browsers as you want on a computer, even open them all at once if you want to. In fact, you can't uninstall I.E.- the most you can do is revert from I.E. 8 to I.E. 7 because Internet Explorer is a Windows component- Windows won't work without it.
No. It's only an internet browser.
IE Is the default internet browser, but if Firefox is installed, you can make firefox the default browser.
In other words, nothing will happen if you hae IE and FF both installed
I have both IE and FF on my computer without any problems. You don't need to uninstall one to try the other.
IE is not just a browser.  It is integrated into many other parts of Windows.  If you were to remove IE, Windows would stop working.

Fortunately, you do not have to remove it to use Firefox.  Just download and install Firefox.  The first time you run it it will ask you if you want FF to be your default browser.  Tell it "Yes" and it will replace IE as your web browser, but still leave IE there to do all the non-browser things it need to do.
Most definitely not. I actually have three separate web browsers: Firefox, IE, and Safari (the apple version). This gives me multiple browsers in case a plug-in doesn't work for one of them. But of all three, my favorite, by far, is Firefox. The customizations to the browser are endless!
