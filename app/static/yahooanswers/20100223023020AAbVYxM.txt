Need help with my wireless network internet setup please?
hi.
im applying for ADSL2+ internet through our phone line and weve got a few computers at home. id like to setup a wireless network so i can connect to the internet wirelessly but im confused with what exactly i need. do i need a wireless router and an adsl2+ modem? or can I get an ADSL2+ Modem with a wireless router built in-one? and obviously i need a wireless receiver so could you please recommend me the best available? could you also please recommend me some great routers maximum of $200 AUD thanks so much guys.

You can ask your internet provider for a wireless modem, but it will cost you a few more bucks each month. You can keep the system you have now and buy a wireless router and everything will work just fine :)

A system like this will work perfectly
