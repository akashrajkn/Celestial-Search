is there Any websites that allow you to go on any website you want?
for example a school p.c blocks allot of websites how can i get them 2 work

you can't as the routers are the key to this and unless you have access to the routers/servers, etc.... you can't
that is if their network admin is smart enough to get all of them, including proxies, etc....
try to use this site :

pricacywanted.info

netrover.info

hidemyass.com

launchwebs.org

clear5.info

bingbot.info

calculatepie.com

unicornpipe.com

truckflood.com

hope its working
What Idham is basically saying is you want to use a Proxy Server. The proxy servers he listed are all blocked by my school already, since they are very popular. The best way to find new proxy servers would to go to Fkn0wned.com a hacking website. Good proxies.
I use my phone as a router :p
try using these sites
maybe it will help you
