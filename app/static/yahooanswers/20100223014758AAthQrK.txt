do Bigpond customers get free downloads off steam?
I know that internode customers get free downloads from the internode servers and 3fl from the 3fl servers, but do BigPond customers get free downloads off any servers?

I've noticed there is a Telstra server located in NSW, but will that give free downloads for an SA customer?
