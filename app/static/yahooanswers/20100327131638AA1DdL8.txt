How to make AIM 7 dock to the side of the screen?
I just upgraded to the new version of AIM.

I had the old version set to "dock" on the left edge of the screen, so even though it wouldn't always be on top (and getting in my way), I'd still be able to see it.

But I can't figure out how to do that now on the new version. Can anyone please help me out?
Thanks!!!

PS: I have Windows Vista if it matters.
YOU ARE WONDERFUL!!! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!

That new button all the way on the top that has an arrow and a line, you press that =D When you dont want it there anymore,  press it again and it will go back to normal.
