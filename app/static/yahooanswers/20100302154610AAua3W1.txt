Do guys use formspring?
I see a lot of my friendgirls have it, but I haven't seen any with guys. Is it mostly a girl thing? I wouldn't want to make one some day only to find out it's a girl thing. :P

Thanks!

i know a couple guys that have it
yepp i kno a ton of guys with them
Dude, it's for everyone. Stop trying to fit in, if you like or want to try something, go for it. Don't be a follower. And I personally don't like formspring because it's pointless haha if anyone has something to ask me, they could do so in person or myspace.
