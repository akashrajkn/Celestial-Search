My computer links are not working!!?
whenever i do a search with google or anything else, when i click on the link to try and get to the suggested site, but it does not follow. it just brings me to a page that says, "oops!! this link appears to be broken!!" i don't know if it is a virus or what. please help!!
and it is with EVERY link, not just one.

OMG!!!! It's a VIRUS!! 

 - loool no big deal dude, the link is just unreachable.
presuming you can access the internet?
