Buying from Amazon UK?
I would like to purchase this, http://www.amazon.co.uk/Titanic-Disc-Deluxe-Collectors-DVD/dp/B000A8NZ6I , from Amazon UK. I live in the US, will I still be able to do that? What is 8.40 pounds in US dollars?? And how does the conversion thing work if you order with a credit card..thanks.

8.40 pounds in dollars is about $12.61. You can still buy it from the UK and if you use a credit card, I think it just converts the pounds to US dollars and takes that amount from the account.
