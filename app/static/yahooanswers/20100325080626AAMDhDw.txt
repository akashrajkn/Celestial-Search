Why do out of country scammers buy stuff on ebay and then just not pay?
This happens to me all the time on expensive items I sell. Some person from Nigeria or the UK or Slovakia or something (clearly a scammer) will buy my item for a high price. Then, just simply not ever pay. What is their point in doing this, like what is there goal?

I think they are hoping people are naive enough to ship the item before the payment is made...
You need to go into your Ebay Preferences and block selling to those countries.

I sell only to the US and Canada.

They bid because they are hoping you are stupid enough to fall for the email they will soon send you stating payment has been made, or they want you to use their shipping company and they will send you a fake payment email, etc...

The list of potential scams is endless.

Do yourself a favor and block those countries you have problems with.
Their goal is to get you to send an expensive electronics item, mobile phone, laptop, jewellery, clothing or anything else that they don't pay for, that they can resell on the black market.  A used laptop can sell for $1000 which is a full year's income for the average person in Ghana or Nigeria
