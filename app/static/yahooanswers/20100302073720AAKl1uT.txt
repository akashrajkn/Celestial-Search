how do people get your IM address?
If I get an IM from someone out of no where, does it mean they're probably just randomly sending out messages in hopes it'll reach someone?  Or does it mean they're a user here?

Bonus Question: what's a polite way to say Hey stupidhead, the name is Maria, so you and your wife will have to look further for a threesome w/ another guy.  Try emailing Bobs or Franks instead of Maria's.

You have your IM open on your profile Mozz.
Change that setting, and they cant IM you.
I write it on the bathroom wall.
You know, half the time I can't even think clearly enough to give you a proper answer, as I'm more often than not lost in laughter after reading your questions  LOL :)
Give him my IM
You question implies that you are using Yahoo! IM and I do not use due to the fact when I did all someone had to do is add @yahoo.com to your ID to IM you. However it has been a while since I used it and do not know if that is still the case. 

Moving on to you statement about the threesome. Reality is married couples have a plethora of choice when it comes to selecting males for a threesome. Single males interested in a threesome are a 'dime a dozen.' Believing that you possess some special talent that they cannot get elsewhere may help your self-confidence but the reality is an invited male in a threesome is nothing more than a tool to increase the wife's pleasure. If you cannot graciously accept rejection then you will find that you will have a difficult time finding couples and that you will have a short-lived life span in the lifestyle. My advice is to accept the rejection and begin to understand what the invited male role is in a threesome.
Magic. Actually, my IM is from my first account on here. I miss that account. Oh well.

Er.... so you're not up for that threesome then eh?
