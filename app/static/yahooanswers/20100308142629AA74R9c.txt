have reset router allll the time WHY?
About every hour I have to reset my belkin router and when I reset I loose all my security settings so I have to set those several times a day. We have a Modem and my wirless router is connected to that any suggestions? I am so sick of this
Its a Belkin Wireless N router Model # f5d8230-4 router

Make and model number of the router would have helped...

Go to the manufacturer's web site and see if there is a firmware update for your router.

Instead of resetting it, next time try just pulling the power plug for a moment and then plugging it back in.
