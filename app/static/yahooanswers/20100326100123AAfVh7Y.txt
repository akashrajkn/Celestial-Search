what is the difference between URL and Web Address?
thanks in advance

No difference.
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is the Internet address of a particular site or document available via the World Wide Web.URLs are composed of the Internet protocol used to access the document or site you are trying to reach, the Internet address of the "host computer," on which the document you want is stored, the directory path on the host computer that will take you to the exact file you are trying to retrieve, and the name of the file you are trying to retrieve. 
A Web Address is like a memorable street address, can help people find you online. This is a unique address that identifies a website. Is a unique string of letters or characters that identify your specific place on the internet such as www.myquestions.com
