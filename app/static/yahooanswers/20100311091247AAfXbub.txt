Does anybody know any good P2P websites?
Does anybody know any good peer to peer websites like mega upload. Ones where I do not need to download any software. Thanks
By the way I already use Torrent sites but they usually take a bit longer to download.
The reason why I want more Peer to Peer sites is because I just want to know some

No! I don't trust P2P. I've gotten viruses from every one I've ever used! 

I know you don't want to download software but I recommend downloading Bitlord:

http://www.bitlord.com/

Then go to torrent sites such as mininova.org, meganova.org or btjunkie.org
P2P means Peer to Peer, and Megaupload is not P2P.

You must download P2P client like ?Torrent and find the torrent files from a torrent page like piratebay.org

DON'T use BitLord, its the worst bittorrent client ever made..
Some good P2P websites are:
The Pirate Bay
Isohunt
btjunkie
(Just use Torrentz search engine)
Some good P2P clients are:
?Torrent-Windows and Mac
Transmission-Ubuntu

Some good file sharing websites are:
Megaupload
Rapidshare
File Factory
Mediafire

Btw P2P is torrents and Megaupload is just a file hosting website, a good website for downloadin stuff is www.psperspective.net
