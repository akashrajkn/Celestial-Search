Is there any way to get back a follower request you denied on Twitter??? I NEED HELP ASAP I PROMISE 10 POINTS!?
Well yesterday a celebrity requested to follow me. I protect my tweets. So...when I went to my follower request I accidently hit deny :( Please please please please please please please help me. I replied to the email that had the follower request on it asking Twitter if they could see the request again but I really doubt they are going to answer. PLEASE HELP ME ANY ONE. Thank you so so so much.

No! Pay better attention next time, being fast at everything is not THAT important!
Nope
now take a deep breath
turn off your computer
leave the cell phone home
and spend the rest of the day outside
