is there a fast way of getting lockerz ...?
is it actually legit? and does any1 k a way to get PTZ fast?

i just joined at the start of march and i have like 480 points. it takes a while, but DEFINATELY become a z lister to earn points faster. i used emails i made up, but i never got a free tee. from what ive seen and what i know, it is legit. it works, but now it takes a while. maybe watch videos while on youtube in a different tab and just mute the lockerz vid. theyre gonna have games to help earn ptz faster, but just logging in, watching videos, answering daily questions, and recruiting friends are the only way for now. good luck!
hey man YES lockerz is absoluetly legit... but if u wanna noe ways to make PTZ fast you gotta check this vid out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dq_lcbzrGg and mail me at ayushsharma2cool@gmail.com with as many unused unjoined accounts and i will mail you ways to quick ptz...
answer dalies login points watch videos invite people.. you can make fake emails too.  I would suggest trying to become a zlister first because after that, your points double so you will get more points for the videos you watch.
