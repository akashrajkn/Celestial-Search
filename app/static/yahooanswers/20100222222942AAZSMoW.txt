Chat Roulette paranoia?
I was just using this crappy chat-based website called chat roulette, and I had some mindless fun with it by annoying other people anonymously and stuff, but now I'm done with it and disconnected, BUT...

For some strange reason, I'm paranoid that the last person I talked to can still see me through my webcam. >_> Like, I know I'm not on that website anymore, but I just have this feeling that people are watching my every movement. Is this even possible?!

I know this is a weird question and you probably think I'm mentally insane or something, but I've been paranoid my entire life, and this is actually a serious question...

They cannot see you, as soon as you exit out of that website it disconnects you from the person you were talking to. Also if you are that paranoid you could unplug your webcam
