New Proxy Websites ??? That Work On School Internet ?
Does anyone know any new proxys that work on the school internet .. :)

Thanks :)  Best answer gets full points

http://www.pimpmyip.org/ works at my school ;)
Give http://turv.info a go as it's brand new and only a few hours old, but if you need a secure ssl proxy then try https://subpr.com instead. You know you can trust both sites as they are part of the Vtunnel network :)

If you use the shortcut to Facebook from the homepage then you shouldn't have any problems using Facebook at all, plus there are shortcuts to Twitter and instant messengers as well.

Enjoy!
use 1 of the below

newcampus.info
oldcampus.info
69google.info

cattype.info
