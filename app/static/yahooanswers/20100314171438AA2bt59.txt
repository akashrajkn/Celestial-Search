Firefox won't save my settings?
The default address bar search engine for Firefox is Ask.com. I REALLY prefer Google, so I found out how to change my setting so that when ever I type something the address bar it'll search it on Google (Ever use Chrome? Just like that, I love that feature.) A few weeks ago I upgraded my Firefox version, and It reverted to Ask.com. I've changed it back several times, yet it ALWAYS reverts to Ask within a few minutes. I've tried rebooting, doesn't help.

NOTE: I know FF has a search bar, but I like using the address bar for it. I feels more like chrome, while having the functionality of FF

Go into control panel and open up internet options. In the tab "General". Go down to the section Change search defaults and click on settings and select Google. Then click on "Set Default". That should make it permanent.
