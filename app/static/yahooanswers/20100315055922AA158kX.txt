i want to make internet to mobile call for free?how do i do it? do i register to a site to get credit to call?if so which site,I'm not looking for paysites.
And can u guys tell me how people make mobile to internet to mobile calls,which services do they use and is there any for free

there are no totally free internet to mobile call services, there has to be some type of infrastructure in place to make this type of call, which means someone has paid for this for a reason, generally to make money.

the best you can do is use a service such as Skype which only costs pennies to call mobiles
