wherecan  download clips of house?
I need some clips of house for a school project, anyone know where i can get them to put them in a powerpoint. Full episodes or random clips, either will work.

Good luck and I hope this helps.
Try hulu. They have clips. I am not sure if they tell download links. If they dont, then its not worth trying to get it from hulu.

If you dont use hulu, try youtube. Find a video, they go to keepvid.com and then you can download it.
