How can I create my own website for free?
I'm in my teens and would like to create a website other than a blog. I don't want to give out too much personal information while regitering [eg. phone number, address].

Any help?

Thanks

Hey

http://www.wix.com/

It only asks for an email and username

It's free, and once you have edited your website then press publish. It's easy to use and great
