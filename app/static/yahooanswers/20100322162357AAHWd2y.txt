2.Mc Afree
Or any other your think is good. Thanks

And i would like to know which type can also help to kill virus in my computer?

Norton and McAfee aren't very good antiviruses, especially considering you have to pay for them. Some free alternatives are Avira, Avast!, or Microsoft Security Essentials. I have used each, and they work great.
avast! is easily the best, and it's free.

I have had Norton, McAfee, and AVG and avast! beats them all.

Note: When you type avast!, it must always, always be formatted exactly like that, even if it's at the beginning or middle of a sentence.  For example:
avast! is awesome.
NOT Avast is awesome.
Norton is terrible, scrap that off your list straight away.

There really is not a "best" one its more a personal choice avg and avast are free and are very good.
I use AVG for my computers and have never had a problem at all. Free to download from filehippo

Microsoft Security Essentials.
Free antivirus.

Built in ad ware/spyware scanner. 
Scans for viruses quickly.
Norton is a really good one. i suggest norton!
