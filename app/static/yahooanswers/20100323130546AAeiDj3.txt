Getting a wireless internet card?
Hello, I live in a very rural area, and I am interested in getting a wireless internet card that I can just hook into my computer without worrying about reception. How do these work? Can I get them by themselves or do I have to also buy a phone, etc.? I've looked at Sprint and AT&T and it looks like they want you to get it with a phone, as well. Is this just a gimmick to try and sell phones? I will be needing another phone company, anyway, so should I get them together? What company do you suggest?

Thanks!

You do not technically need a phone, but they may require you to get one.  Though if you push they may relent and just let you buy the card.

From what i've heard verizon is the best for that kind of thing, followed by at&t.  I've been told (by a best buy mobile employee) that sprints data network is terrible.
