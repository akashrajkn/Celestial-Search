Trouble with Firefox?
When I download something on Firefox, it begins to download, but after it completes, it is no longer in the little "Downloads box" that pops up on the screen (the one with a "clear list" option on the bottom less).

Where, then do I manually find the program I'm trying to download to complete the installation? It's an updated anti-spyware program.

make sure you have the regular foxfire.
