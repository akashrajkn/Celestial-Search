Question about Lockerz?
If i have enough points to say, get a macbook 13 inch on lockerz.com. is it completley free? or do i simply earn a discount by earnign the points. or is it completley free. also when will they restock?

It is completely free, you dont have to pay for shipping,or do any surveys, or complete any sponsor offers. But I dont know when they will restock they wont announce it for some reason.
