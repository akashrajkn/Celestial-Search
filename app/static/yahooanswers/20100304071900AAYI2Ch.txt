Which is the best browser of IE 6 Vs IE 7 vs IE 8 Vs Mozila 3.6 Vs Safari Vs Chrome?
It seems that IE 6 is going to be murdered by Microsoft today...

mozilla has the fewest glitches from any browser that ive used, IE8 is good, especially with all the add ons from google you can add in, but mozilla can also use the same add ons, and crashes less. 

chrome is alright, but not great, its a bit slow!

overall mozilla for the win.
It's between Firefox (Mozilla) and Chrome.  They're both open source browsers, and are both pretty quick.  I'd try each and make your own mind up.
IE8 older versions are security risks. I also use chrome because its simple nice features and a tad bit quicker.
Relatively IE 8 supports many features in different websites safari is still in infant stage relatively to the others Mozilla is the fastest for me. Chrome still have many bugs in it
If you only want for browsing then Chrome is fastest but if you want to have fully personalised browser then use firefox.
NONE!
Try the newly released opera 10.5! It rocks! its the fastest!

ITS PROVEN TO BE THE FASTEST :)
