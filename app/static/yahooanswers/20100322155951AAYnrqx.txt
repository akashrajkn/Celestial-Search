Does windows 7 provide adequate virus protection?

No operating systems provide adequate virus protection.
Your windows program doesn't provide the virus protection you need to get a security program to do that.  The only type of protection that it provides is a firewall.  But it is advisable that you get security software that has it's own firewall that is superior to Microsofts.
No. Windows 7 is an operating system. Operating systems don't provide any real protection (except for the occasional security warning). However, Microsoft has released an Anti-Virus called "Microsoft Security Essentials." Look it up online. It works great with Windows 7 and has worked great for me so far.
