Is AVG Anti-virus a legit anti-virus program?
A computer at our office was running AVG Anti-virus program and it seemed to be scanning every e-mail that came in and it was making me nervous so I uninstalled it and deleted any leftover files there were. I don't mind having it if it is legit but all I can find on google is ads for the program?!?

AVG is very legit. Although nowhere close to being the best out. Malwarebytes is the best handsdown and its free. wwww.malwarebytes.com
Yes, it's a legit program. I've been running it for years! Works very well.
AVG is a legit program and it works good, but its not the best out there.
it's legit. but not very good.
I recommend using Super Anti-Spyware. Its an official government program. The trial can be downloaded for free at http://www.superantispyware.com/ and the trial never expires The trial is almost identical to the full program. It acts as an all in one anti virus and is 100% safe
