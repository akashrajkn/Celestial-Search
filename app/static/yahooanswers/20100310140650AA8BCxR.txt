On Points2Shop what does "Your status prevents you from accessing those areas" mean?
How do i change it?

I get the same thing, I got it a few days ago and apparently it's when you either create 2 accounts on the same ip or log into points2shop on a different ip. I didn't do either of these but i still get it :(
