Is there anyway I can record or download something when I watch it on ABC iview?
Is it possible to download or record an episode on a tv show you watch on abc iview?

You might want to look into a free program called Freecorder. However, some sites have their signals scrambled so downloading isn't possible, even with programs like Freecorder. This is to protect copyrighted material from being grabbed without authorization.
