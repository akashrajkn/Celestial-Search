How often is the member redemption for Lockerz?
I just saw one pass on the 25th, but I didn't bother to enter for it, since I didn't have enough points for anything nice and I just signed up a month ago.

So that makes me wondering, how often is the redemption?

And, if someone could add, is there any cost that I have to incur because of receiving the prize? (other than losing PTZ)

I think lockerz don't work well, the all video is fake!

It will be better use this service: sonsoldi.it

The only services certainly working are on "sonsoldi".
Don't listen to the idiot that answered lol, Ive been trying to find out my self and looking around it seems to be once a month. lockerz IS NOT fake. My friend invited me and he got a hold of an xbox.
Redemptions are once a month. This month is the first time there has been a member redemption, though.

And no, there is no extra cost you have to pay, unless you choose to join the member redemption.
