question about blogtv?
why dont people talk? i have 10 "viewers" and 0 "chatters" 
who arent the viewers "chatters" ??

Well, people can be watching your broadcast without being signed into the chat. I have noticed the view count  often lags behind the number of actual chatters. This could be a glitch or a way for blogtv to keep broadcasters happy.
