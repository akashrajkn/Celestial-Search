What is a good Browser for my computer?
I have Windows XP and I'm currently using Internet Explorer, But its been crashing a lot, And I prefer Safari, But the only working downloads for it are for Macs, So, Any other browsers I could try? (please don't recommend FireFox, I know for a fact that it doesnt work.) So, If you have a working link for Safari, Please send it. Or Link something else, If you will.

Opera.
Google's Chrome

I've liked it so far.
Above all browsers, I prefer Google Chrome. It is fast and very light to use.

You can download it at:

Probably fastest browser out there.
I'm using Google Chrome.  It's a minimalist browser and starts up really quickly.  You can of course go to the new Browser Choice site and pick any one you want.

IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, K-Melon, GreenBrowser, Sleipnir, Avant Browser, Flock, FlashPeak, Maxthon Browser.

IE is still the most widely used browser (if you include all the different versions), then Firefox, Chome, Safari and Opera.

They all have their own advantages and disadvantages.  Opera support mouse gestures for example, but Firefox and Chrome can have this feature by installing an Add-on.  Safari seems to be really quick at navigating to other pages as I think it does some sort of pre-loading.  

As I say though I'm using Chrome.
