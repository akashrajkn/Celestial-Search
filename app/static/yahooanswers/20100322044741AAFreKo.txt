Why do i have bad internet connection from my bunk bed?
I have a metal bunk bed and i have the bottom bed. i have really good fast internet but when i take my laptop to my bed the internet gets really slow and sometimes disconnects. Could it be the metal bunk bed interfering with the signal? why does this happen?

Yes, more than likely. You could try using a better external USB WiFi card.
