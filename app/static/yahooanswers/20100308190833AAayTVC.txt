Easy formspring question.?
When a person gets asked questions on formspring (one right after the other), can the person who owns the account see what time they were asked?

not the time exactly.. but like how many days ago.. atleast thats what i see on mine right now.. i dont know if its different for anyone else though.
It tells you how many minutes/hours ago it was right under the questionn.
