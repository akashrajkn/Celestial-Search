Where, How and Why did the Internet start?
thanks in advance

Originally it was set up for communications links between military bases. In the 90's President Clinton and VP Gore opened it up to commercial traffic.
Basically, it was originally a US military scheme (ARPANET) to provide redundant communication links across the US in the event of a nuclear war. 

Then educational civilian organisations realised the potential of this system and the rest of the world followed....
Al Gore invented it, he said so!  What ever Al Gore says has to be true!

The US government linked computers together to better access information.  From that early start we now have the internet as we know it.

It started under President Eisenhower.
