whats the name of this search engine?
i forgot what it's called, but its a combination of other search engines like google, yahoo, msn (and some more), and also video sites, like youtube and blinkx. it had a dark gray/black background and on the main page there were four or more rows for each topic (like image search and video search) in a fimstrip style that could be scrolled to the left or right.
and i think it has a "z" in it, and might be like a real word except for the fact that it's spelt with a z

I don't know about the "z" name you are talking about, but there are plenty of sites that have multiple search engines. 

One such site is www.800go.com were you scroll down and select google, yahoo, boing, or what ever search engine you prefer.
