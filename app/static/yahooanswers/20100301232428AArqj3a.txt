How are the people you're following on tumblr arranged on your profile?
You know how there's all those little icons on your tumblr profile of people you're following, how is that arranged? Is there any order or is it random?

Well they don't arrange according to alphabet or recently followed, that's what I notice. I think it's completely random.
