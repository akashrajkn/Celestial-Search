You could write an ebook about something you know, then sell it.
Here they make you a professional page for it http://computereweb.com/get-10-dollar-website it only costs $10
when you get going you can write more ebooks and keep on selling them, it's a good method.
What is your first sense when you meet some program that promise you to give money just for joining with no other efforts? "It is too good to be true" - is that? In prevalence it IS too good to be true.
The Internet is overload with all kinds of on-line business stuff. There are many usable programs either. But as far as I know by experience there aren't way to earn money without investing your efforts. Firstly you must learn a lot to succeed in that field. Secondly you must implement what you learn. Without these main things every program that you join will seem scam.
You need to make a little mind switch first: from "employee" mentality to "self employed" mentality.
It might even take you 5 years to make this tiny switch but unless you make it, you will never find any "legitimate online job".
