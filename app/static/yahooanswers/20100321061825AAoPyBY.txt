I need some advice...?
I asked this question before but for some reason it got deleted. So I recently created a blog and I was just wondering what other people thought of it. I'm new to this whole blogging world so I was just wondering if there was anything I can do to make my blog better. Be honest, I really want to know what you think. Also, any good suggestions to get some more followers would be great.

Thank you for your time,

My question was deleted and Yahoo Answer's team never explained to me why they did it and I could't find a reason in their contract. I think they are not listening to the people who use this site. This is indicative of poor management.
