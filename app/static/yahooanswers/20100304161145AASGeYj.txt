Is there a website similar to eBay but more art / furniture oriented?
I have some art furniture I would like to sell and have not had any luck doing so through eBay.

Hey guys

There's this new startup company in Palo Alto that was started by people who were sick of the way eBay ripped off their sellers. It's a quick and easy way to sell things and market the things you're selling.

It connects to your social networking websites and shows all your friends what is being sold. The listing is also posted on the website's twitter and marketed all over the web

Check out the site: http://yardsellr.com/C0Y

It's called "yardsellr"

Hope you guys like it. Email me anything you have to say about the site: questions, comments, feedback, anything at maryminno@yahoo.com. If you like the site, share it with your friends.

There are plenty of other auction websites but they are not really better. What I would recommend is looking for local furniture auction places. I live in Arizona and I know of a furniture auction place about 20 miles from me that buys art/furniture and then resells it at their art/furniture oriented auction. I'm not sure about other states, but this can't be the only one.
