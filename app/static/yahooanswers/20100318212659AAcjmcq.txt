How does mylife.com get my info when I never joined?
I looked my name up in google and this website "mylife.com" came up.

It had my full name, my myspace link, my age, and a list of all the cities Ive lived in. Even a picture of me. But I NEVER joined this website.

Through public records and web searches.
thats so weird...
someone must have used your information or something. cant be anything else than that, that i can think of. its not like the site randomly stalks you. i think someone used your info
Because, there are a lot of websites on the internet that offer some services in exchange for your personal information. Since you never actually read the License Agreement, you might have overlooked that they have permission to sell your private information to companies like mylife.com.
When a site requires you to fill up personal information, check the License Agreement and the website credentials first.
