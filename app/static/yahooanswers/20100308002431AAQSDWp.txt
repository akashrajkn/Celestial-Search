Reinstall WinRAR 
it will solve your problem.
Maybe you clicked on a link that points to an RARed or Zipped file which is why WinRAR popped up. Usually you have a choice between opening it with WinRAR or saving the file on your hard disk for later viewing or opening.
Is this a legal or a cracked copy of WinRAR?

I own a legal copy, and mine makes absolutely no connections to the internet whatsoever.
(Version 3.92.)
WinRAR doesn't have the ability to auto-update, nor does it have the ability do check for updates.

My firewall doesn't register WinRAR as making any connections to the internet.
(No incoming or outgoing.)

Either you are using a cracked version that connects to the internet for whatever reason, or you are clicking on links that point to .rar files on the internet.
