My domain name has expired but my details are still on Whois?
I paid my subscription 2 weeks after it expired and now some anonymous person is using it. My domain provider won't answer my letters or emails. Should I just give up on this and just register a new domain name and cut my losses?
http://domains.whois.com still shows MY details as domain owner. Other WHOIS sites says someone else. Confused!

You should still be able to contact the new domain owner through their proxy.
after 4 or 5 days of expiry of domain it automatically divert to public domain registry. So if you want to register it again then you will have to pay higher price than normal registry. If no one register this domain then it will delete after 3 month and will available again.

get .com, domain just Rs. 350 only and .in 250  for one year web space also available.
