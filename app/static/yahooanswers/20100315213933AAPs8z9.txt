How can I become a better sh-t talker?
I'm tired of all these flamers online that want to pick a fight every opportunity they get. In chatrooms, in forums, pretty much anywhere where people gather to communicate, I see them. what frustrates me more is that I'm horrible at coming up with comebacks. I'm not a good smack talker. People tell me to just ignore them, but they get worse if I do, and I just can't stand them.

So how can I become a better sh-t talker so I can actually confront them and win? Help :(

Watch all the comedy central roasts on Hulu. Also, Look up Lisa Lampinelli on Youtube and Hulu.
haha you want to win? then you become what they are. Revenge is the answer to nothing, and when revenge is the only thing that satisfies you then you will always be fighting with people
