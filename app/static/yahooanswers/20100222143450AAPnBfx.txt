thanks

Nope, but then again, it's not real leather either. 

It's a cute present though :) 
Hope whoever gets it likes it!! 

:)
in american dollars?
if not no
It's 21.67 US dollars. If you ever need to know something like this again, type "______pounds to US dollars" into google. Google automatically calculates the amount of $s and gives the answer as the first search result. Ps..... if you dont use US dollars,,, NO! It is not expensive!!!!!!!!

Hope I helped :D :D :D
Not at all, it's $21.67
cheap
