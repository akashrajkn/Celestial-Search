It is possible for someone to hack into your computer and see what you are running yes.  However, this is unlikely especially if you have proper Firewall/AV and even then it's unlikely they'll be able to see exactly what you are viewing.  If the other person you're worried about doesn't have computer skills then no don't worry about it.
Not remotely, aka it's difficult. Someone would have to hack into your computer or otherwise plant a trojan in your system, but if your computer is clean of viruses no one can know what your doing.
If you are on a wifi with your laptop and it's not secured by WPA or better WPA2 (encrypted) then anyone can get on your wifi & see exactly what's going on. If it's secured, then no, nobody can see what you see
