If you close a tab on Firefox, is there a way to get it back?
Suppose you had multiple tabs opened and you accidentally closed one of them but forgot the URL, is there a short cut or something that allows you to get it back? Maybe there's an add-on or something?

maybe check history on when you closed it or temp internet files
Right click the line where tabs go, and click "Undo Close Tab"
It happens to everyone, and it's annoying. Sometimes the wrong tab gets closed in Firefox, but it's OK. There's a solution to the problem, and it comes in the form of CTRL + SHIFT + T

or you can add this addon for better use
