Why does Chat Roulette always switch my cam from ManyCam to my webcam?
Hello!
Well I learned how to make a "fake webcam" for Chat Roulette on a program called ManyCam. Anyway, I went to chatroulette, switched my cam to "ManyCam" (there were two ManyCam options?) and my video shows up and everything, it plays perfectly, etc. Now, when I press "start" and it connects me to somebody, it switches back to my webcam and you can see me?? How can I fix this? 
Thank ya! :)

idk this is happening to me to and its angering me xD
I hade the same problem an di found out why:


1st:you need to download google chrome 
2ng:go to chatrt.com
3rd:it will show manycam as 1 of you cams to use.


ps.hope it help and if it does pls top ans me ;) -_-
Use split cam or any other program instead
I believe that Chat roulette has started blocking the 'fake webcam' programs like Manycam.  You can go back to the original version of Chat roulette via chatroulette.com/classic and run the older version.  This one still works with Manycam.  I think the intention of the authors is to try to stop Manycam completely.
