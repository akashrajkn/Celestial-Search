which is the fastest start up browser ie8 firefox chrome safari opera lunascape6?
i find lunascape6 orion the fastest start up browser what about you?

i've tryed all of them and i found that firefox is the fastest
Chrome for Windows is considerably faster than Firefox. Chromium for Linux is faster than Chrome. But that's just my opinion. =) I guess it has a lot to do with your computer, as well.
I've tried all but i find firefox is the fastest
Chrome is a compact program and loads and reacts very fast. But it also depends on how many add-ons, plugins and bookmarks, etc the program has to load when starting.
Chrome is the FASTEST on all basis
That's a bit of a loaded question isn't it? 

It entirely depends on your RAM size, CPU speed and your internect connection speed.

It also depends on how much hanging on junk you have on the browser, like Tabs, Feeds, RSS etc.

I run IE 8 with absolutely everything disabled on it so it is just a bare minimum browser that's connected to a fibre optic 20 Mb/s connection which delivers, so yes I would say that is fast!
