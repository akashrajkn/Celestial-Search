Is there an English website with a biography on Dr. Gerhard Stalling?
Dr. Gerhard Stalling founded the first guide dog school for the blind. I'm doing a project on guide dogs for the blind and I need to write a biography on him and I can't find one ANYWHERE! I don't want a website about how he was walking with a soldier and his dog... I need an actual biography on his life! Please! I need this for school! If you know anything about him then write it here, I need all the help I can get!

This International Guide Dog Federation article has a good historical overview:

Go to your library and a librarian for help. The internet is not the only source of information, a fact which seems to be lost on students these days. Public libraries have more than just books. There are also periodical catalogs and subscription-based databases that can help you find information.
