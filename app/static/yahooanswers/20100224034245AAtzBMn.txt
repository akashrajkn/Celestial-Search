it also says connection refused?

first of all .does it load in IE or atleast any other browser ? if not, check your connection.
also if you are using a network, you may have to configure settings of firefox accordingly.OPTIONS->ADVANCED->NETWORK SETTINGS.
configure referring to internet options in control panel .
other than this firefox itself will NEVER create any problems. millions are using it.

anyways try google chrome for a change...!
hope it helps...
Where are you typing the URL?  In the Navigation bar, or in Google search?

Direct URLs should be typed in the Navigation bar /address bar at the top.

"Untitled" sounds like you have opened a blank page using the "Open a new Tab" button, just close that tab by clicking on the X to close it on the (Untitled) tab.
