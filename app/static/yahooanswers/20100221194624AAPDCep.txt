IS badideatshirts.com reliable?
I want to buy a t-shirt there, but I don't wanna give my money to some crap service, that'll just either steal my money, or just give me a crap shirt. So, is it? HELP!

I haven't heard of them. I personally prefer to buy clothes from Amazon or Cafepress, both being quite reliable well priced websites.
