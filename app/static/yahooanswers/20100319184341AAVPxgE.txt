Proboards or Invisionfree?
I have used Proboards for a little over six years, and haven't really tried using invisionfree seriously, but which honestly is the better forum for an RPG?

I've heard that proboards is generally better because it is safer and less buggy, but invisionfree wins a lot of votes because it has more coding functionality.

Which do you think is the better board regarding security and reliability? Please do not consider the coding bonuses/graphic add ons in the vote.

I don't prefer either of them to be honest. I'd go with http://www.forumotion.com

- Proboards are easily hacked, prone to spam bots, etc.
- Invisionfree is a little better, though now more prone to bots and spam then ever. Also run a bit slow and have a shitty ACP.
