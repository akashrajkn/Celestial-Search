Is it possible to ONLY get Cox internet?
Is it possible to only get Cox internet, without getting their cable?

Currently I have Qwest DSL, and DirecTV.
We love our DirecTV, so we want to keep it, but get faster internet.

Is it possible?
And how much would it be for medium speed?
Thank you

$34 a month for the 1st 5 months. $70 a month after that.
