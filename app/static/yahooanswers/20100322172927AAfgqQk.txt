i just made the account a few days ago.. and none of my family members know i have a twitter

Probably because your Twitter account to starting to suck.
It's all those fake spam accounts that are getting deleted.
sounds like a virus....or maybe someone hacked in your account and erased them. Probably a family member? You know as a joke....haha!
Do you Follow4Follow, if so people follow you, you follow them then they SECRETLY unfollow you, Bwords lol
