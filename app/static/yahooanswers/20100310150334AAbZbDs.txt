Need someone to copy and paste a virus fix guide! please help!?
My PC is infected with a virus called "Total PC Defender"
I was able to open the internet by going through the task manager since all of my programs disappeared from the desktop
However, i can't navigate away from yahoo or google without getting an error message
Could someone please copy and paste a guide to remove Total PC Defender into an answer so I can access it right from this site?
