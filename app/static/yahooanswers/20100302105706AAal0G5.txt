Is it possible for a website to show up in the internet history without logging on to it?
So I have this strange thing going on on my computer. Recently in the history its been saying that I've logged onto Facebook. I know my sister has used this computer a long time ago to log on to her account but not in a long time. I've noticed that facebook keeps showing up in the history. Can anyone explain this?

You don't have to login to a website for it to be in internet history, just visiting it records that.
I wish I could...I try to tell my wife that the porno sites just pop up, but she doesn't believe me.  I wonder why?
if you never deleted your history, it would still be there, but if you have,somebody has been on the pc.
