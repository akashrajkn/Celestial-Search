How can I keep in good contact with my ebay product buyer and what steps should I take to send the item?
I just made an ebay account and i am selling Call of Duty: World at War. Someone bought it and I was wondering what steps a good seller would take to contact the buyer, receive payment, and ship the item. I live in Connecticut, I put shipping at $2.99, I have paypal, and I'm shipping with a priority mail medium flat rate box. Could you guys give me some tips?? Thanks.

Tell him thank you and let him know when your shipping it, as a buyer I always like to know. However, if your using a flat rate box, I believe the shipping is going to be more than $2.99. Check the prices online. If you don't want to pay that much, get a different box and have the post office weigh it, that should be cheaper.
