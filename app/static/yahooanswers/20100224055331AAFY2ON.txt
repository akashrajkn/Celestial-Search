How do I delete my word prompting that appears every time I search?


Cleanup your browser of cookies and turn the autocomplete off
I'm guessing you're using google - if so, just head here 

http://www.google.com/preferences?hl=en 

and then under "Query Suggestions" select "Do not provide query suggestions in the search box".

That should do it.
