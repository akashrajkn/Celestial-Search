can anyone tell me if this site is legit?
I found the site newest-laptops.com while searching the web for a new macbook and i just wanted to get a second opinion. It's so much cheaper to buy it here than off apple themselves. Does it look like a scam?

DEFINITELY a scam.  Apple does not allow authorized retailers to alter their prices.  Therefore, if a price is different than that from Apple's website, then they cannot possibly be an authorized retailer and therefore it's a scam.
I don't think this site can be trusted so better not put any personal information in there. Just my opinion anyway.
Install the WOT (Web of Trust) add on for Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. It's a very useful link scanner for surfing the web and it's free. ^_^
