runescape prepaid card question?
i know that the runescape prepaid card gives you a code to activate membership but when you're doing that do you have to put your personal info like where you live??

hmm......yeah you do. But they're not going to verify whether you're really living there so you need not put in the right details.
Otherwise you could even try

It gives you 10 dollar's worth of membership to runescape for free. 
You just need to earn 9 points
try it
ummm?? for the prepaid cards i am sure you just need to go to the store and buy them and then just put the code in then you have your membership
