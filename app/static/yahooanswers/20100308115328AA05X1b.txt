internet explorer has stopped working?
every time i try to look for things on the internet it comes up internet explorer has stopped working. i cant search for internet explorer or anything else because everytime i do that keeps comming up. it is still on the internet and my favorites all open and work.

Because it blows. What you want is Firefox.
If internet explorer stopped working.. then how did you make this question?
use firefox
