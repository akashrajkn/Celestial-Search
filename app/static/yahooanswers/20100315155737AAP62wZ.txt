How do i put a picture on chat roulette?
You see, I don't own a webcam or a mic so I thought it would best to just put on a picture. I don't know how though. :(
Please help!

i don't know if this would work BUT you can try.

try downloading a program for free called manycam and with that your webcam thing will be anything.

hope it works

Virtual Web-cam software allow you to use images or videos instead of real web-cam
ManyCam is a good program!! I use it when i go on Facebuzz.com and it's a lot of fun!
