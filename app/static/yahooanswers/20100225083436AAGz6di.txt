ebay pay pal question? using green dot prepaid visa?
is it possible to use a green dot visa or pre paid credit cards from safe way rite aid etc. to set up a pay pal account?

Yes it is. I have a greendot card that was purchased strictly for my pay pal account. Once I got the account set up, I went to the card website and clicked on information about direct deposit. I used that information routing number and account number for my checking account information. Then I used the number off the card as a cc/debit entry.
