where can i find a free ancestry website?
im looking for a free ancestry website or an adoption website for the UK..... no sign up....Please if anyone could help me?

None of them are free when it comes to searching for relatives, the cheapest to join is Genes reunited:http://www.genesreunited.co.uk which charge ?5 per year and more for searches. If you want free I suggest you produce your own database and compile your tree that way. You can download free MS Access database formats already done if you have MS Office on your pc. The other alternative is to buy a family tree software program off Ebay for about ?10:http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Create-Your-Own-Family-Tree-Software-New_W0QQitemZ110407783438QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_Computing_Software_Software_SR?hash=item19b4d1140e
Try your local Library, In my town ancestory can be used free for half an hour, after that there is a small charge.
