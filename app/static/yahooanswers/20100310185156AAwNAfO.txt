Okay, Before I EVEN BEGIN, I gotta say that I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE screamers! They are horrible and mean. But I once had my little brother(who says he's not afraid of anything!) do the scary maze game(as a joke of course) and It scared him sooooooooooo bad, he jumped like 2 feet off the ground! It was funnnyyyyy! ;-) But I hate it when the jokes on u! :(
