How much do you think I would get for some Xbox 360 stuff on eBay?
How much do you think I would get on eBay for these...   (all good as new)

- Xbox 360 60gb Console (with all cables etc.)
- Black Wireless Controller
- Wireless Network Adapter
- 9 games (COD 4, COD 5, COD 6, Left 4 Dead, Far Cry Predator Instincts, FIFA 10, Ashes Cricket 2009, 007 Quantum of Solace and Tom Clancys Rainbow Six Vegas)

Thanks

that would roughly fetch 400-450. (AUS) if they are ~3months and un-opened.

(also i dont know if youre interested but im currently selling my drumkit, dont know if you'd be interested but im hunting down a 360 at current..)
You can check the completed listings for similiar items sold for the last 15 days by going to Advanced search > Enter your keyword ie Xbox 360 60gb console > Tick the completed listings box > search, this will give you a good indication of what price this has sold for. Repeat search for all your items.
I sold Tom Clancys rainbox 6 the end of last year (it was a PS3 game though), it sold for $15.50 AU - High sell rate ranging in price from $10 to $25 at the time. You can get lucky.
