What is the best website you've ever been on?


ebay!
Piratbay
The world's most boring website - yes, there is actually such thing.
www.myfontpage.com - it lets you create your own custom google homepage
This one is the best: www.fermantech.net
Here's a new social/dating site that just launched. I like it because it's actually a little different for others. You can actually do a community video chat or private video chat, you can post ads the same as you would do on craig's list, and if you fill out the contact us form at the bottom of the the page and send it off with requesting a free upgrade they will upgrade you for FREE!!!! for 30 days!! WOOT WOOT cant go wrong with free!!!
