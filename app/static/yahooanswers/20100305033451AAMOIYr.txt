How many Domains can i host in BlueHost, web hosting?
I see that they have unlimmited web Hosting services...
but what am not sure of is SUPPOSE one has more than 1 website, and want to host with them, Do  u buy separate hosting packages??

if you go for the $6.95 per month option i think you get one domain and 100 mysql databases, if you want to add more domains it costs around $10 a year for each one, you can then of course add each of these to the databases
I suggest you this website http://www.tenhostingreviews.com where you can find a list of the Top 10 Web hosting companies with the best features, support and pricing
Depending on what plan you get with BlueHost, just look to see if they allow (domain) add-ons. I'm sure you can even ask them and they'll tell you.

If you don't get the answer you want, though, try my site at www.bestdamnwebsites.com. There you can get an unlimited hosting plan for $30.00 per month with free domain registration. However, you should probably try a reseller account.

We offer those for people like you that need to host more than one account. We have a starter plan that is also unlimited and is $30.00 per year with one free domain for your reseller account and $9.99 per year domain names for the rest. That account allows 10 domains to be hosted in one account.

We also have two mid level plans. The first allow you to host 100 domains for $50.00 per year (again, one free domain name for your reseller account and the rest are $9.99 per year).

We also offer a pay-as-you-go reseller plan which means you pay a flat rate of $20.00 per year for each hosting account and each account includes free domain registration. This is great for anyone wanting to get started. However, you must have at least 5 of these accounts running or you will be billed the full $30.00 per account (but you'll still get free domain registration even still). On the other hand, you can have as many of these accounts as you wish.

We also have an unlimited reseller plan that allows you to host as many domains as you want for $199 per year. Again, you'll get one free domain for your reseller account and the rest are $9.99 per year.

All accounts are unlimited.

Hope that at least gives you a good option if BlueHost isn't the answer for you. You can contact me directly at brandon@bestdamnwebsites.com if you have any other questions.
The unlimted hosting means that you can host more than one website on the same hosting package. You just have to pay for any additional domain name registration. (it's about $10/year).

Bluehost is one of the best hosts, but there are some even better offers, like one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They're also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.

bluehost will allow you to host unlimited "add-on" domains in your shared hosting account.  In other words, you don't have to buy a separate hosting package to host more than one website at bluhost.  See the full bluehost review here - 

http://www.website-hosting-reviews.net/blue-host.html
You can host as many as you want via an addon domain. Addon domains let you host different sites on your account and they share the same space. For example if your primary site is yourdomain123.com, you could make yourdomain456.com as an addon domain. The yourdomain456.com would be a totally separate Web site and visitors wouldn't know its part of your yourdomain123.com.

Most decent hosting packages allow this. Bluehost is a good host. If you want to go with a little better host though, I would look into Hostgator or Dreamhost.

Dreamhost is employee owned, so they seem like they truly care about thier customers. Hostgator has awsome support. I have accounts with Dreamhost, Godaddy, Hostgator, and Bluehost. Withouth a doubt, of all those Dreamhost and Hostgator by far have been the best.

I have had no downtime on any of my sites and thier support is great. Dreamhost also offers a 100% uptime guarantee and they even have a $97 day money back guarantee if you decide you dont like them. That way you can try them out to see if you like them.

I would say Dreamhost is slightly better than Hostgator, but they will both treat you great and offer one on one help in case you run into problems, whereas some of the big companies, ie godaddy are terrible to deal with if you need one on one support with someone that speaks good english, especially if your not tech savy.

Here are some Dreamhost coupon codes in case you decide to try them:

SAVEMONTHLY ($40 off Monthly Hosting)
20OFFHOSTING ($20 Off Hosting Package)
2DOMFREE (2 Additional Free Domain Names with Signup)
1IPFORFREE (Get 1 Free Lifetime Unique IP)
65OFFHOSTING ($65 Off 1 Year Hosting Package)

Here are some coupons for Hostgator:

SNOWMAN (20% off)
BOSTON (25$ off)
HOUSTON ($25 off)
HGC25 ($9.94 off new hosting)

Good luck!

Some web hosting providers like Bluehost & FatCow allow you to host multiple websites. FatCow is one of the finest website hosting available over the internet. There are many but to choose the best is not easy. Just checked with Webhostingbreak and found their services very reliable. For the past many months, I'm using their services. Very much amazing, how quickly they resolve any issues. The web hosting servers are very fast. http://www.webhostingbreak.com/fat-cow-coupon/
