can i turn off the sound in just firefox?
im playing a game and want to listen to music. I know this has been asked before (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AudYVpgBpUawU9PzGdwN8cUAAAAA;_ylv=3?qid=20070921144910AA3QzZD), but the answer doesn't really help.

At the bottom right corner of your explorer bar (you know, with the start menu on it) there shuld be a little Speaker icon for volume control.

Right click and hit "Open Volume Mixer".  Here you can control individual volumes.

This works on Vista and Windows 7, and it's been too long since I used XP to promise results there.
Just go to the taskbar. look at the bottom right corner for the little volume icon. Click it. 
Increase or decrease the volume according to ur requirement.
Uncheck mute.

If this thing doesn't work for you. Check the settings in the game.
Hope that helps...
