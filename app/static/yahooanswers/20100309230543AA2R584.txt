whats better Firefox or Google chrome?
i have Google chrome

firefox has addons which are great.  and better security.  chrome is faster.  depends on what you need.
That's all a matter of opinion.  I use Firefox myself
Google chrome
I use Firefox the most!
Then Internet Explorer
Chrome i use only for Google Wave since it seems to work much better in there browser0.o duh!
In my experience, Chrome is faster, a lot faster. I don't know about security.
i agree with Craig on add-ons, Firefox has a much larger collection is useful and effective add-ons/extensions. 

The speed issue is quite debatable.
Firefox is faster and it has got a lot of addon's.


Chrome is visually good and fast--OK.!
it has auto complete.
But i heard it contain a virus or like that.!!!!

Anyway,i suggest firefox
google chrome
