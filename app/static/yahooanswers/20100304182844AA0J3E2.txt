Is giving false information in those "offers" illegal?
A friend of my sister's friends was doing one of those offer things (WIN $500 now! Just enter your information...) to get like virtual money on some website. He entered the wrong information and like a Wal-Mart's phone number from some other state as his home phone. I laughed at it, but I was wondering if he could get into trouble by doing that, especially if something weird was sent to another person's address or if that Wal-Mart got really pissed. So, is it illegal, or just something really stupid?
Sorry.. I'm a bit OCD. I meant to say a friend of my sister's* :|
Ha. I probably sound like an idiot. I was just curious. I didn't think they were, but I guess you never know. I don't do them. I'm not giving my information out. :)

No it's not illegal.
Since those offers aren't legal to begin with, and misleading.

Just make sure you don't put in your real information.
No, if it was illegal, I probably would have been caught by now.
It's legal. Those are illegal scam to begin with so they couldn't press charges. If they harassed that Walmart, it would be the scammers who got in trouble, not you.
