Where can I find low-size (1 GB or so) torrent movies?


well u can find all sorts of movies on btjukie.com.dont foget to rate.thanx
are you looking for torrent? There are a lot of websites offering movies direct download from rapidshare, megaupload and so on. For example, oneclickmoviez.com (be careful with viruses). They are a lot <= 1GB sized movies.
there are 2 sites i consider them from the best torrent sites 
they are ( isohunt.com and mininova.org)
www.kickasstorrents.com/ 
thepiratebay.org
isohunt.com

but if you want my opinion , you should install Vuze ( http://hwcdn01.vuze.com/files/Vuze_Installer.exe ) and add other sites templates in it , so you can easily search them in the Vuze without checking all the sites , and you can  limit file sizes and check their health and more ...

if you wanted help about it , let me know , I'd be glad to help you :)

mininova doesn't work anymore .
I consider to be isohunt.com one of the best torrent downloader sites. I have personally downloaded over 500 gigs of movies/ episodes/ blu-rays from isohunt.com, you also have the ability to read posts regarding quality and speed. All in all very reliable.
VUZE

works well - reliable torrents
I have found isohunt.com to provide great torrents the are sized at about 700mb to 1.3GB. 

It has some extra features like Rating and Comments which help sort out the fakes from the real Torrent movies.

Its a great and fast site overall so thats why I still use it.
