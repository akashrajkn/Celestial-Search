What is a website that I can watch shows for free without doing surveys or downloading anything?
Our tv doesn't work and I want to watch some shows. In the past I've came to websites where you have to do some dumb surveys or download something. Could you please tell me any websites without any of that? Oh and for free.

hulu.com - it has mostly newer shows from NBC and Fox.
definitely try hulu.com.
You can watch tv shows at faststreamtv.com
I watch tv shows for free      at free-tv-watch.info  and they are of good quality
