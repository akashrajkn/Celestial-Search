myspace vs facebook???????!?
Which one do you think is better??

Myspace.
Gotta go with the classics.
facebook...duh???
Facebook hands down. It allows for quick viewing of everyone you know as well as still offering the more localized viewing of a single friend. Plus no one is sending you porn invites everyday.
Myspace all the way.  Facebook is boring and dull...just a plain site with updates.
Both are pointless.
face book....
