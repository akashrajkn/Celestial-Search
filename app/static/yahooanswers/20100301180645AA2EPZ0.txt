Computer Virus!!!!!!!?
So these days on my computer, it begins to lag ALOT. I checked windows task manager on processes, and it saids hw1.exe, and also msb.exe which take alot of memory and cpu. When i delete both of them, the lag stops. Any help?

Only thing I can suggest for now is to do a Disk Cleanup. Go to Start > AllPrograms > Accesories > Systemtools > Disk cleanup

Disk defrag is also a good thing to do once in a while.
msb.exe is a know virus to the pc community. i would recommend getting a virus program, or formatting your harddrive
If you don't have anti-virus (yet!) then get out to one of the on-line virus scanners.. .something like HouseCall:

or Bitdefenders

I've used 'em, they work, there are others, you can try more than one.  Get a scan done and let it clean up whatever it can.

Next hit malwarebytes....

http://www.malwarebytes.org/

Install that and run it. That will help clean up any malware (which isn't necessarily a virus, although I suspect msb.exe is and who knows if it's leveraging hw1.exe)

You can do your scans and see how things look.  Then, if you don't already, get a virus scanner and get it up to date.  Avoid suspicious sites, turn off flash in our web browser (OK, not practical, but it would help!) and be careful!

Good luck.
