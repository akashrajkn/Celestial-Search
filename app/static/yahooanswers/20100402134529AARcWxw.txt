http://terrisfp1.com/holidays/chick.swf

i got it as an easter email, and the link wont work :(
i've googled it and other sites had posted the identical link, so it's not like the link was typed wrong ... 
i reallly want to see it, any help is appreciated :)

I also received this link in an e-mail and it didn't work.  I then keyed the address in and I did get to the web page ("Care 2 Make A Difference") but when I clicked on 'Happy Easter" I got the same HTTP 404 error - "The page is unavailable or has been changed."  It doesn't really answer your question but at least you know others are also having problems with it.
