Lockerz: Z list help?
Ho can I send invites? How can the other person then accept the invite I sent them? Steps please..

In the top of the page, between PLAY and REDEEM, you have the invite section(CONNECT), just put the e-mail address of the people you want to invite and after you are done, click INVITE, they will receive an e-mail from Lockerz, and then, they'll only need to accept and register.
But I heard that they are having problems with hotmail address, not sure if they fixed that yet.
