What happend isohunt?
i can't access this site last some days i got this message "Oops! This link appears to be broken." what happend dear Isohunt....

Are you going straight to IsoHunt's main page, or is the link to something on the site?

A straight link (http://isohunt.com/) works on my pc.

If you use a link to something (http://isohunt.com/release/blablabla/), then whatever "blablabla" is, might have been removed.
it is a website to upload your torrent files and update your torrent trackes ,,,......hence the link http://isohunt.com
