Do i have to put spaces in between a credit card number?
when i enter it on amazon.
cause they keep declining my visa debit card :S
the name and the expiration day are correct...

No - no spaces!

Systems {anywhere, not just Amazon} will not recognise a credit or debit card number if you put in the spaces. Just write it as one long 16 digit number.
no
If they give you multiple boxes for your credit card number then the spaces are already added in.  Otherwise you do not have to worry about them.  

Most websites will tell you either "with" or "without" spaces... though some just assume.
Try it with numbers only, some sites want it that way.
