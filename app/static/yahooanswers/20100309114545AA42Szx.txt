Why does my internet keep crashing?
I'm using Mozilla FireFox 3.6 I just upgraded it but it still crashes and doesn't respond, wth?!
When i go to play FarmVille or go onto Chatroulette, its just freezes and then doesnt respond.
What can I do ?

okay, here is a simple solution
Go here: http://www.opera.com/browser/download/

and download Opera Internet browser, it is the fastest and the best one you'll find.
That should fix your problem

:)
