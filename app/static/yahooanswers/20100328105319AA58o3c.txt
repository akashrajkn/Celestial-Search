Are free rewards legitimate? Such as "claimfreerewards.com"?
I was just curious about these "free rewards" things and i would like to participate in the website "claimfreerewards.com" to have a possibility of claiming an "Ipad" I thank you all for any Information you can give me

Usually you have to fill out tons of surveys and make purchases to receive coupons, so it's not that it's actually free in a sense of not having to do anything. You'll also notice that you'll get a huge amount of unwanted email. I've had curiosities about sites like this, but all the surveys and pop ups and emails were so annoying that I gave up. If you want free stuff, try entering sweepstakes.
