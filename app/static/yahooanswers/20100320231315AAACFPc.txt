have you actually clicked on a pop up and followed through it?
after all the years i been on the internet, i never have

no way jose... basic rule of the internet, unless you're virus hunting!
No, I aint that stupid.
No and I hope nobody ever does.
yes, only out of curiosity, most of them are just surveys that go on and on and on and oviously your not going to get your free whatever they offered.
its a very bad idea it will give you a lot of viruses its pointless dont do it
Not really, most of them are ads.
In case popups are like installation of firefox extensions then i do follow.
In the 15 years I have been on the internet, I have known better than to do that!
it does not matter
