why is formspring saying "page not found?"?
whenever i try to go to my friend's page it says "page not found" and i know for a fact she didn't delete or disable her account, nor did she change her name or anything. anyone else have this problem or know what's going on?
this person is still on my list of people i'm following and i can still see their posts on the feed thingy, i just cant see their literal page

it's either been deleted or you don;t have permission to view that page.
