Blocking on Formspring.me?
I learned that by clicking the "Spam" button on a question on Formspring, it apparently will block the person (or so the site says).  I was wondering if anyone knew if this holds true even if the user is anonymous?  Will it block their IP address or something?

Thanks!

It will block the IP address. When they try to ask another question, it wills say invalid request - to make it look like it's just an error and they are not blocked.
They can unblock themselves by resetting their internet or going on another computer.

When they ask non-anonymous then it blocks their username.

When they ask anonymous, it blocks their IP because other than that their is no way to identify them.
