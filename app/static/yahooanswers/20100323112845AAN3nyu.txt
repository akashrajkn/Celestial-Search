Anyone else having 4Shared problems?
I am a frequent 4Shared user.
I love my music, alright?
It's a safer alternative compared to LimeWire. (Which I used to use)
But my point:
Whenever I try to search on there, or even go to their homepage, I get this message:
"The connection was reset
The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.
The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network connection.
If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web."

It's rather obvious that I use FireFox. Help me?
Thanks! (:
