my internet works but my computer says there is no internet connection?


then there is something wrong with the connection. could be as simple as the cord came loose. or could be you need to update your drivers.
Hi there! If it is a laptop..., there is a switch that slides to turn the connection on and off. Mine is located in the front on the left. Give yours a quick look over and see what you find. Good luck to you!
