Download of movie stopped half way!?
I just downloaded a movie and halfway through the movie just stopped downloading like it was through. The movie doesn't play. Even though I have half of the download it's just useless. Is there any way I can continue the download where I left off.

you have to start the download again.
if you want VLC will let you watch what you did get successfully.
