My FormspringMe page won't display any questions beyond the front page; is there a way this can be changed?
Someone just pointed out to me that for some reason my account seems to have a glitch where only the first page is displayed, and when the "More" button is selected nothing happens. 

Does anyone know how I can fix this problem so all my questions are displayed?

I've noticed that all the sites have been doing that today...it must just be a glitch in the entire website. If it still doesn't work in a few days contact the owners of formspring err whatever..
