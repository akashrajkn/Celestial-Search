How can I stop flashing adverts - they aggravate my tendency to get migraines?
Sending emails can be a pain - literally - when half the screen it taken up by an advert for something I'll never need - in glorious psychedelic technicolour with flashing images. Has anyone managed to switch these off?

If you have the firefox browser you can block flash ads by using the flash block pluggin.

The good thing about this pluggin is that if you click the F where the ad should be you can see what it was. ( some sites use flash so its handy to be able to turn on or off.
