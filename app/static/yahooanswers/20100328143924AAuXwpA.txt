How do you start a blog?
Have you ever had a blog?
Is there certain website to go to?

Check out www.webs.com. It is free, and i have many sites on there like www.siminformation.webs.com you can set up a blog, arcade, or anything. Check it out.
Get hosting, decide on blog software, install it, and then start writing.
In the past I used blogger but currently use thoughts.com, both are free. You can always just try out a site, if you don't like it then copy and paste your blog to another site!
there are plenty of website

myspace
blog spot
blogger
blog flux

just google that and you will see all those sites
There are many websites to go to. Try this:

First, go to http://BlueDirk.com
decide on an address for your blog, called a Domain name
then, sign up for a blog subscription.
the webmaster (myself) will e-mail you back and set up the blog page for you. I can have you up and blogging in no time.
