I lost a taskbar (History, View, File, Bookmarks, Tools, etc.) all on the same bar.?
Since losing the bar, I can't click on to bring it back, like I now can't get into options and all my bookmarks. Please help. Thank you. If you can help, explane it slow and easy read directions. Again thanks. Robert

You may have gone into full-screen mode.  Try pressing the F11 key to get out of it.

Hope that helps.
