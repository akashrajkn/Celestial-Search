How do find my paypal ID?


Have you looked behind the sofa?

If you have printed out a receipt from a purchase or a deposit to Pay Pal , it should be on there somewhere.
Or did you not write it down in a place where you keep your passwords etc for your accounts?
Go to Pay Pal website and find contact us or help there and you can answer some coded questions that should help.
