JUNK E-MAIL, while using the e-mail account for the first time?
Hi,
I have created a new e-mail account at Live Mail (hotmail), and the first e-mail I sent from that new e-mail account to myself (to an older e-mail addres of mine) to test my new account, was not good. It sent that first mail to the junk folder of my older e-mail account. So, the new e-mail address is marked as junk, while I never used it before. Every one get my e-mails from my new account to junk e-mail folder.

What can I do?

it can be the email id name..... change the account... create a new one.... there is no support for this free account,, so far i think.
Junk email:
when an email address is not in your address book then it goes to junk...
