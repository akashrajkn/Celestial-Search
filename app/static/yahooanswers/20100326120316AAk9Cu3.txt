Ebay item description policy?
Could someone please provide a link to ebay's policy stating what constitutes a book to be:
"like new", "very good", "good", etc....

I don't believe there is one; but don't put " like new" in the title as that is keyword spamming.
When buyers are searching for New; your item will be amongst them.
You are allowed to state its condition within the description
An item is either New or Used
There is no set policy as far as  books go.

Just be honest. 

If you read it once, then state that.

If the cover is torn or creased or dirty, state that.

Show a clear picture of the front and back covers.
