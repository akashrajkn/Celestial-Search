Is there a way to trick prizerebel of our country?
Is there a way to trick prizerebel of our country? Because you need to be in Australia, Uk, USA and Canada to do surveys, and I live in Portugal. Is there a way to do surveys and get points without being on those countries???

Thanks,

Sorry, but no. I would suggest you look for a portugal version of these surveys.
I'm afraid there are no Portuguese offers. The only solution that won't risk a ban is to create a support ticket saying that you're moving to the US, buy some proxy software, and change your IP address to one in America. Hide My @$$ is a good program. Do NOT use a free proxy to complete offers. That's a very easy way to lose the account. Your best bet is referrals, but it took me three months to get 20 referral points on PR (using Yahoo Answers, incidentally). Good luck! Some GPT websites have universal offers, but they're few, far between, and/or disreputable.
