Has anyone here wrote or is writing for eHow?
I just started and I want to know if you really make money doing it. I am not really looking for a work at home job but I wanted to start writing in my free time and I ran across eHow. It stated that it pays. I read everything about how it works but I would like to hear from someone that has or is doing this. How much to do you make every month and how long did it take to reach that?

Wow this is interesting! You can be paid? I love that site, (I don't write for it), however if it pays I most certainly will start! I'm going to save your question! Thanks!
