Is rewards1.com a for real site?
I just wanted to know if rewards1.com really worked because I want some Microsoft points and it could just be advertisement so could somebody help me out please?

Yes I've gotten about $50 in Amazon gift cards from them. Sometimes they aren't the best GPT site because it takes weeks or sometimes months to get prizes. They don't update or add new offers so it makes it difficult to earn points without referrals. I'd recommend PrizeRebel, which is the same as Rewards1 but they add new offers that credit well and they approve prizes within a few days. The only reason I like Rewards1 for is their forums, which I'm a member of. If you have PayPal or you would like to buy stuff from Amazon.com then you could try GPT sites like SimpleGPT, CrownGPT, PaidtheFastest and others you can search for to get PayPal cash and Amazon gift cards. Some of these sites offer other gift cards like Wal-Mart, Visa, and Ebay gift certificates. 

If you decide to use GPT sites then make sure you decide to look at offer guides for help in case you need it, you can usually find them on the websites forum. My favorite offers to complete are from Eversave because they credit well. Most people new to GPT sites don't know that some offers may not credit because you don't qualify for them or you may have done something wrong.

If you want to ask me any questions you can message me on Rewards1 forums, I'm user JayJay777.
