How do i find ideas for my website?
I'm planning on building my own website,i bought the software needed to make a pretty decent go of it,but i've now hit a wall.
I've not got any idea what to put on my site.
Obviously,i could go with what i am familiar with,but pretty much of what i am familiar with has been done to death in one way or another.
I'm really wanting or trying to do something unique and original.
Can anyone help inspire me.

Thanks

I think nearly everything has been done to death. Whatever your interested in, try to do a different take on it to most other people. It is hard to think up new ideas that's for sure.

Stick with what you know - it pays off.

I started with a site on wordpress.com before self-hosting and like everything else it had been done to death completely, but it was something I knew about.

As long as you have good content you can compete with sites that are very similar and in the right niche people will take a look, post comments on other related sites and you will get traffic from those who want to look further afield. I gain traffic from social sites, similar sites, youtube and search engines and by the same token I also drive traffic to other sites.

Do what you are familiar with and stick with it, it takes time to gain recognition in any area unless you have something that is completely unique - and most of what is unique is a scam :-)
