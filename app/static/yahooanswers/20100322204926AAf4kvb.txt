I sold books that my sister wiped her bloody boogers in.  Not sure what to do?
This is a long story, and it's going to sound ridiculous, but it's true and I need advice.  I recently helped my younger sister sell some of her old manga books on Ebay.  When I was flipping through the books to make sure there were no bookmarks, torn pages, etc., I realized that she had wiped bloody boogers in them when she was younger.  I can't just cancel the sale, because someone already bought the books and paid for them.  Should I just go ahead and ship them?  Can the buyer call the cops on me because of the bloodlike substance on the pages?

LMAO that is great.
Just do what any businessman would do. Sell them, make attempts to clean them away. The person knows that they are used.
Even if they called the police on you, the small amount of blood is nothing, you can contact the seller and ask if they still want the books or not, if you both agree to cancel then nothing is wrong, if you both agree to keep the transaction going all is good.

The seller may want a some money off, that would be entirely up to you both of you. I have constant nose bleeds and some get on my books because they drip before I can get a tissue.
I would probably refund the buyer & request to cancel the transaction. basically tell them you didnt realise the books had "issues" I dont think I could bring myself to tell the truth though (Im cringing at the thought "shiver") maybe say it had missing pages or something
If I was the buyer I would be disgusted & most likely leave you a neg especially if nothing was mentioned in the listing & you failed to refund.
I doubt anyone would call the cops but personally I couldnt send something in that condition.
