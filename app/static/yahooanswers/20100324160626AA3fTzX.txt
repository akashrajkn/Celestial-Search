Should I download INTERNET EXPLORER 8?
Sometimes when i go on a Internet it tells me that i'm not supported. So should I download INTERNET EXPLORER 8? 

Why do they have to change it?? How is Internet explorer 8 any better than Internet explorer 7? 
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Thank you
I meant to say how is Internet 8 better than internet 6

8 is more secure than 7 and even a lot of PC-Geeks have installed it.
ie8 is 50x's faster and better than ie7!

go ahead sweety and download it right now!
IE 8 is ok. I like Google Chrome. It is a small program and pretty fast. And you don't have to deal with all the error messages that pop up for Internet Explorer. I actually have IE8, Chrome and Firefox on my computer. My son uses Firefox.
