Is there a virus for the playstation 3?
i am pretty sure there is some of my freinds got it and all i wanna know is if it is gone or patched

If you have the PS3, then you have a virus. The only way to get rid of the PS3 virus is to throw the PS3 away and buy an xbox360
Yes there is and they're working on to fixing it.
Sony says there is a glitch in the clock.... if you have the old fat PS3 they don't want you to play it till they can patch. if you have a new slim one, then you're good to go
lol the top answer is so funny


no there is no such thing as a virus for ps3 thats BS
there was a bug not a virus, now its totally fixed!
No you don't have a virus something just went wrong with tha calender/clock/ settings . Soo , all you have do is nor to play with your playstation for a week or so.
