Aaahhhh! Why has my internet stopped working!?
Tonnes to get done on my pc, but internet stopped working, the url for sky broadband comes up but the page stays white for a few seconds, then the page just vanishes. have tried doing system restore, norton anti virus, but the same problem.
Thanks in advance.
Myron, this is someone else's computer you chump.

Reset the modem and router
The fact that you posted here tells me it is working
Need more info.
Do other websites work?  If so, then the internet isn't the problem; that particular web page is.

If no sites work, try unplugging the power to your modem (and router, if you've got one) from the wall for about a minute, then plug them back in and give them a minute to reboot.  If that doesn't work, unplug the ethernet cable from your computer for a minute or two and plug that back in.  If neither of those things work, call tech support.
