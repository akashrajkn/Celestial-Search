Best site in my opinion:
A lot of new movies are on this site but you can also find all the classics. Also many movies that are now airing in theaters, can be found here. You can watch different TV shows as well on the same website for free. Movies are full length and high quality. Site is free to use and virus free. You have the option to just watch them or if you want, download them. Hope this helps you! Enjoy!
