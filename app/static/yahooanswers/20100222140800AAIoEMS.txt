Does anyone use Pidgin?
I use Pidgin...the instant messenger. It used to be fine but a few weeks ago, it stopped letting me sign on to my AIM account. My Yahoo IM still works, but as far as the AIM goes, it's very temperamental. Some days it will work and some days it wont.

I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software. And yes, I have the latest version available.

Does anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong, or how I can fix this problem?
