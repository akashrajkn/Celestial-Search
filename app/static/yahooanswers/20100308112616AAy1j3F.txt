Anyone know of any legit online jobs that doesnt require any training?
...or any upfront costs. is there really anything out there like that, that is really legit. if so what do you have to do and how much does it pay?

Think of your skills, what can you offer? Browse the Craigs List classifieds., lots of scams, but some actual good jobs. I've been looking on and off for a long time and got lucky last week.
Why not start your own thing, get a site, add some adverts and drive traffic to it :
