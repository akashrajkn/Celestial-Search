My internet connection is fine, but for some reason I can't access the internet?
About a month ago, one day I clicked on my Internet, and the page said that it could not be accessed. I'm a little confused, because the internet symbol says it is fine, and on all the other accounts on this computer, (like the one I'm using now) the Internet loads perfectly. 
I've tried everything. Does anyone know what's going on, and how I can fix it? 
Thanks, it's driving me crazy!

it might be possible that administrator might have changed the network setting for ur account.
it may be possible that the setting of anti-virus may be changed
I think the website is blocked by your ISP. You should use proxy to unblock it, use this website if u r beginner.

ads will annoy you, if u want to surf without ads, you need little knowledge of proxy then use this website.
