What new internet browser works for Windows Home Edition?
I tried Internet Explorer 8 but it doesn't work for windows home edition, so what should I get? I wanted IE8 because I know how simple it is, so if there's another almost like that reccomend it =]

They all do.  IE8 should work, must be your pc.
IE should work... but try Google Chrome. It's nice and simple. It only has the buttons you need, no unnecessary ones. http://google.com/chrome
