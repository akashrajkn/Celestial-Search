What happens if a seller does not reply to a your paypal refund request ?
Recently i bought some products from an online seller, his reputation wasn't bad and he had positive reviews. However, after i paid him the money through paypal he told me that he was out of stock and that I would have to wait an 'indefinite' amount of time before he resupplied. Therefore, i decided to get a refund on the product. I informed the seller on this, and he agreed. Since then i have sent him a refund request through paypal for the amount i paid, but he has yet to reply or respond to me. What can i do if he continues to 'not' respond to my refund request?

Escalate the problem in Paypal and tell them what is going on, Paypal will get your money back. Make sure you do it within the 2 week of making the payment.
