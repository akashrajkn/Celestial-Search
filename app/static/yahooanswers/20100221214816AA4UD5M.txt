You could still get drive by viruses.
You gotta be careful with spyware...even if you don't download anything!
sadly it is when you access these sites that they sneakily download  viruses etc. they know you want to hav e peek  and wont download stuff so they will be ready and waiting for You mostly. if you really want to peek then you must invest in very up to date and effective security software. firewalls etc
goto a Pay site Only... One.. youll get WAY better content for your time.. be able to download most everything to keep local... Two.. you generally wont get hit w/ 10,000 spyware attacks trying tog et into your pc.

If you must.. use a pc u dont care about.. and wouldnt hesitate to reformat the whole thing at a moments notice.
It all depends on which websites you go on. Some will give you viruses other won't. Go on trusted sites and not any website you find thru google. Yes, generally erotic sites won't give you as much viruses but they still can. If you have a good anti-virus like Avast! or NOD32 then you should be fine
tube sites like http://www.j-goddess.net and http://www.yellowbutts.com are viewable only so no harm
Of Course, But it will effect YOU more
