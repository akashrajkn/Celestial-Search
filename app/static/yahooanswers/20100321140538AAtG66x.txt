Is ebay Safe to buy from?
I have seen somethings on ebay which i have not found anywhere else. I want to buy this mans hairband like the ones you see Fernando Torres wear etc but cant seem to find them them anywhere and indian necklace with an om sign. If you know another website please paste otherwise is ebay safe for me to buy items such as these, its just that i have only started buying off the internet because i know some people who have bad experiences with internet buying.
thanks

ebay is safe too buy from, look at the feedback from the seller it can tell you everything
Look into the sellers feedback and read some of the previous comments from people who are bought from them before.
Becareful on Ebay i would recommend some other place i have heard of storys of other people getting ripped off on ebay
don't worry ebay is safe! i am quite an ebay addict and everything i have ever ordered has came :)
Imagine buying from a third world street market with the stall holders describing stuff to you over the phone. That's Ebay.
If the seller has good feedback then yes. Be careful though - remember if a deal seems too good to be true it probably is!
If you use PayPal, then yes. Yes it is.
Apparently but i dont trust them!
Ebay is very safe, a bit too safe !! but always check the sellers feedback scores and comments other buyers have left, and always use paypal as this is the fastest and safest way to pay, in case you don't receive your item, eBay and paypal would do their best to get your refund!! But its quite expensive to sell things, and i would recommend gumtree !! gud luk !!
