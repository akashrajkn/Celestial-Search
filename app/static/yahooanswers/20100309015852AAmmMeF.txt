can i withdraw from paying ebay seller ?
I wanted to buy a studio headphone and a US seller (reputed)  was selling it for 70$.i did  a thorough search and found a Chinese seller who sold it for 10$ less.i made an offer & won the item, but afterwards i read some feedback about the seller.lot of people have complained about items being fake !so i bought the same item from the US seller and payed him. now i'm wondering what to do with the Chinese seller.i made a mistake by buying from a Chinese seller,  i do have previous experience of buying a 32bg flash drive from Chinese seller and the device was a fake one & i  couldn't get a refund .    I made a mistake but how can i correct it ??  any advice will be useful .thanks !!!!

It's better to be on the safe side with chinese sellers. If you have initiated a sale and took back in middle, then you need not worry.

State your reasons to the Chinese seller over why you took a back step. Also state what the negative comment was which made you to think one more time.

Its not gonna be a problem.
Just communicate with the seller & ask the withdraw from the sale. They might be OK with it, they might not. If they refuse to cancel they will issue you a strike for non payment, get a few of these & ebay will cancel your account.  

It might be a good idea to offer the seller something for their non refundable fees after all its not their fault you purchased it. Not trying to be smart by that comment just trying to say (as a seller myself) by confirming your bid/offer you have entered into a contract with them & changing your mind about dealing with them sort of doesnt cut it, if you know what I mean.  

Personally I would never buy anything from China, everything is fake, even the fake items are fake lol

Anyway just communicate with them, apologise profusely - it could work for you.
