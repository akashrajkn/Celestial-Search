YUO Tube...? Is it a virus!!?
Hey, someone posted a link of a video...I clicked it and it directed me to a page of nonsense words...just random words. Then it took me to YUOtube.com. Not YOUtube.
Then, a bunch of popups started appearing and it told me I had to download Flash and my antivirus went crazy...

Virus? Has anyone ever heard of YUOtube???

Enjoy your virus.
YES!!
Ignore the comment above mine, it looks like a spam.

Yes it sounds like a virus site. I would stay well clear of it in future.
