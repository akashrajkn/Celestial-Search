What happens to my bookmarked sites if I uninstall my internet explorer ?
I am switching to Safari and I have Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. I have favourites for both. I know that Safari copies your favourites from the two but what if i uninstall internet explorer and mozilla? will my favourites be uninstalled too ?

You can sabe ur bookmarks, just go to The favourite filder in ur computer and copyright The links to ur desktop as backup. That way if ur favourites don't show up, u only have to copy them into the favourite folder.
