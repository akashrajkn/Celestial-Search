What are the most interesting websites you've discovered?
Also explain why.

Rotten.com

Haven't been to it in forever.

Awesome, that's why.
pornhub.com
why? why not!!
Reddit.com - Provides links to the most interesting stuff on the web.
Digg.com - Same thing but approx. two days behind Reddit.
Abovetopsecret.com    Pretty much explains itself, but it has to do with people who are either genius or insane. Anyways, it's a site full of conspiracy ideas, different ideas on aliens things like that. Much of the community is credible though, and will back up whatever they are trying to say with links to outside sources and news feeds. Some things are simply out of this world, talking about abductions and such but hey if this is your thing, this site is for you.
dealnews.com
