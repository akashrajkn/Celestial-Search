How to get TV on computer?
on my friends laptop he has little tabs up the top to watch Cartoon network, MTV, Fox8 and he wont tell me how to do it. How do you do it??

There is alot of different websites like fancast.com and hulu.com
You need a "tv tuner card"
If you have one installed you can use Media Center to watch tv on your computer
With a PC tv-tuner you can add a coaxial connection to your computer so you can connect the cord from your cable/satellite box or an antenna. There are some tv channels that provide access via their online websites and there are some programs that make those channes/shows/clips available from within the program like the windows media center.

With a slingbox you can access your home cable/satellite over the internet.
