this page has a step by step thingy to buying stuff on ebay, just follow it
yea its kinda dumb really..

seller sells the item in two ways..

1. bidding(auction)  2. buy it now

option one has a time limit for about one week..if you are the highest bidder for the item till the closing time of item , then u win.if some one bids more than you then you loose..you have to constantly view the item and keep on bidding. if you are the hishest bidder , then.pay the amount and get the item

option two..very simple and tesion free...just click on buy it now , pay and get the item..
Only buy items shiped from nigeria. Any other sources are fake. Dont use pay pal send cash only! trusted ebay power seller
