Can you reccommend a good second-hand online bookstore for the UK?
I've been looking online and all I seem to find is websites that organise book exchanges between people. I'm just looking for a website that sells used hardbacks of classics though, so if anyone could suggest where I could look then that'd be a big help. Thanks

There is one run by a charity, I think it is called Green ........ something, I'll get back to you if I remember the full address, its a worthwhile cause and paperbacks used to be a standard ?2. You can also sell on books you no longer need.
www.greenmetropolis.com.

Good luck.

OzAdz had some second hand books on it. I bought some good books from the site.
