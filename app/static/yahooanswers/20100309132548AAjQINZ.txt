Different ways to get in touch with my Blog?
I have a blog at - http://rurusblog.tumblr.com. And when I ask people to get in touch, they never do. The current ways for people to get in touch are :

e-mail ( rurusblog@live.co.uk ),
Twitter ( @rurusblog ),
Facebook

But does anyone have any ides for people to get in touch, without really having to sign up for anything. 

My blog can use HTML, and I have some understanding of it.

If you have ANY ideas, PLEASE reply!

thank you 
:D

You could put in a 'contact me' form that emails you, and is easy to fill in.
