Is there a site you can advertise stuff what are up for bidding free?
Without Using a credit card and in the UK
I am looking to sell Mobile Phones and Gaming Disc and Accessories 
Like eBay but free
Were other people bid and its Pay on collection

what about craigs list?
www.ebid.co.uk

you can sign up sell your items for free and only pay a small fee if the item sells. ( It is a small fee as well, about 2% of the final sale fee.
You can sell via auction or fixed priced format.

Basically it is the same as ebay but cheaper and you don't need a bank account.
