How to create a  free blog 
If you like to create  a  free blog and without any ads by them 
www.blogspot.com   is   best site in the world which provides unlimited space to make a free wesbsite. 
You can get the free website  like www.yousitename.tk in another place. 
In  www.dot.tk If you like to Ask any doubts just leave message,
Id say try Multiply.com
its a great site its what i use. 
you can design your page and speak freely i love it. 
you can allow others to read your blog or have it off limits to anyone who you think shouldnt read it. 
its free. 
and its pretty easy to set up. 
oh and they tend not to care what you talk about.
