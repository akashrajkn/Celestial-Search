Is it safe to download ringtones from METRO LYRICS?
I'd like to get an All American Rejects song on my phone and I was wondering if metrolyrics.com is safe.

If not, is there any where else to download / buy songs from online?

Thanks

Those are just advertisements. Never believe them. I have developed a habit of not looking at those. I suggest everyone would learn to do that too :)
Norro is right dont do it
No, they are mainly ads that will make you pay.
