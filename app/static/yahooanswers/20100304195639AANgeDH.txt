Blogger vs Wordpress?
Pros and Cons?
By blogger, I refer to blogspot

Hey LFCfan,

I much prefer wordpress.com simply for the reason blogger.com is owned by Google.

And we all know that the 800 pound gorilla of the search engine world can do anything they want.

Including deciding closing your blogger blog on a whim.

Well, that's probably not really fair. They usually have their reasons. You really have to follow their terms of use closely. Violations can and will get your blog blocked.

But, what do you want, access to your own information all the time, or when Google decides when you can have access?

Good luck...
I don't have a blog myself, but most bloggers I know of prefer Wordpress. Personally I like the interface on Wordpress more than the one on Blogspot. Wordpress blogs usually have an About Me page, which I find useful in analyzing the quality of a blog as a whole (I mean, knowing who the blogger is can say a lot about its content).
