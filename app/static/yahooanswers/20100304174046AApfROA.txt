Any ideas for a blog/blog title?
I really want to start a blog....I was trying to come up with ideas, and the only one I could come up with was a blog showing my artwork..? I like to paint, and I thought I could maybe post about what I paint. I need a title, or a better idea.

How about, "A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words"?

You can post a picture of your painting, and follow it up with a paragraph that is exactly 1,000 words long that tells a story about your painting or about what inspired you or whatnot.

One of my favorite blog titles of all time is at phonymcphonerson.blogspot.com. (Be advised the title does include a curse word, so proceed with caution.) Good luck with your blog!

Good Luck!
