How do you delete friends on AIM so they can't look at your profile?
I made an AIM account 2 years ago and I want to delete friends that I don't know in real life so I can add friends I know from school. On aim.com, it says I have 11 buddies but on Bebo, it says I have none. If I hit Delete Selection when I'm on AIM, will that remove them from my buddy list and their buddy list?

Delete &nd Block Them.
No.
you could delete them off your list, but you won't get deleted from their list unless they delete you on their own.
