No activation email from The Pirate Bay?
Yes, I did check the spam folder... I tried this with my gmail and yahoo emails. Still nothing.
Did you get any emails from them? Any way to actually upload torrents without getting the email?

yes
There seems to be some issue with their email server again, I can't register either. Absolutely frustrating!

Update: Moderator confirms that their mailserver is "broken" at the moment.
