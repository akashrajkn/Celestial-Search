Message board suggestion?
Hi all, 
I'm trying to find a decent place to start a message board....
I've checked out a bunch of sites, most of which are overly complicated and have poor features. 

I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a forum/messageboard host which has the ability to edit a post without "edited by" appearing in the post somewhere...
And also post approval features, so you can check what added to your board before it becomes public viewing. 

I've tried proboards, yuku, phpbb, forum motion and some others too but didn't find much joy. 
If anyone can help point me in the right direction I would be very grateful. 
Thanks all!

What I have used (though not been admin of) is google groups.  You may want to give that a try, or maybe yahoo groups.  I would recommend that the most if you are planning to use a message board with people that you know personally.
As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your forum website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you¡¯re going to create a forum site at your own domain without any forced ads, you need a web host providing forum tools (phpbb or vbulletin).

Take a look at:
http://www.threehosts.com/forum
There you can reach the three reputable companies that are leaders in the forum website hosting industry.

There you can find a video tutorial to learn how do it.
I have used a few but I like http://www.forumotion.com the best its simple and easy to use

The best thing about Forumotion is that there is nothing to download and nothing to setup. You just have to choose a forum name and they'll do the rest. You can have a fully functioning forum up and running in less than 30 seconds.
