Internet explorer is always running?
I was recently trying to install adobe fireworks and it said that i needed to close internet explorer to continue. I was confused because internet explorer was already closed. So i went into task manager and tried to force close internet explorer, it closed then instantly opened again, i have run spybot and AVG and neither pick up any viruses...

If anyone else has experienced similar things and knows how to fix it please tell me, i really need these programs!

P.S when i open task manager there are two internet explorers one running at 56,000 and the other at 6,000... neither will close.. thankyou to anyone who can help!
By task manager i mean processes tab, have tried restarting... also closing programs that may be accessing internet explorer... eg windows live messenger... Thanks anyway.

Don't know why it would reopen after closing it in task manager... could be there's another program trying to access the internet using IE.

Have you tried closing it in the Processes tab rather than Applications?  I think it's called ieexplore.exe.

There is a good program that gives you a much more detailed view of the processes running, you could see if any other program is running that doesn't need to be and closing that to see if it helps.

If that still doesn't work try restarting your computer, that often fixes weird stuff like this for me :)
