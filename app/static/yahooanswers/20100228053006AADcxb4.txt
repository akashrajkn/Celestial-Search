Does anyone know why i can't......?
Heyy :D
I'm a member of zwinky, yes i know - but i have no life...so yeah :)
But, i haven't been on it in ages, and about a week ago i went on it for the first time, but when i go on games and stuff, i can't cash in because the button keeps, like disappearing...?
Have any of you experienced this? Its so annoying, because i like - have NO money left... :\

Thank youuu :) x

No problem! You should talk to me on myspace if you have one :]
