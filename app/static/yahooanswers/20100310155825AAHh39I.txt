when is the next lockerz redemption?


its on march 25. at 6pm eastern
Lockerz has already been exposed as a scam. They even pay people to come on websites like this and answer questions stating it's not a scam. There is no redemption, it will just say ran out-coming soon again on that redemption date.
you can't know untill it is posted on their site, but you can subscribe to http://www.lockerzalerts.com , these guys send you a sms whenever there is a redemption, and it's free.
