about to download one....but not sure which one is the best for me
i have windows xp by the way; on a laptop

chrome, its light, fast, and it works
Mozilla Firefox.
Firefox you have lots of ad on options and great web security
chrome is ok 
don't use IE that got more holes in the program then a pound of swiss cheese.

safari is ok used it a few time but still think firefox is the best on out there
GOOGLE CHROME! I got it a few days ago, & its lovely jubbly. Very fast...uncluttered...easy to use..customisable etc :D
chrome is fast and light
firefox is powerful and has many features
opera is fast and light
IE bad
google chrome defo
