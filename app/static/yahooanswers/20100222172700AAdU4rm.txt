What are the fonts used in the Carol never wore her goggles poster?


Aachen Bold. It might be either a standard Windows font or something that comes with common software - I have it on my computer and I certainly didn't put it there on purpose :D

If you need to buy it, it's $36 here http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/aachen-bold.aspx
