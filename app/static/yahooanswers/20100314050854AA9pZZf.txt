is it possible to go down a level on yahoo answers?


I'm not sure, but you probably could if you asked lots of questions and didn't give any answers.
Yes it's possible. Asking questions deducts 5 points  every questions you asked.
only ask questions
don't answer
you'll lose 5 pts against every question
maybe. I was deducted 5 points every time i ask a question
yes,lets say you have 250 points and ans a question, you will go back to level one
Yes it is. See the points system here:
