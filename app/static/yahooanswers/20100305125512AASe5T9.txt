How often do Lockerz get new questions?
i watched all the videos so how often is more posted? Any other ways also to earn points otha then watchin videos doin the daily stuff and invitin ppl.

I don't know how often they upload more videos, but Lockerz sucks. There is no other way to earn points other than watching videos, answering the dailies, and inviting people. You can never redeem anything when the time comes anyway. I have over 200 points and I have never gotten to redeem anything. 

You should join Points2Shop. It's way better. I already got 3 PSP games, some PSP accessories, and a book to learn Japanese. You can get any prize you want from amazon. 
Also you can get up to 150 points in one game. :)

Right now I think they add shows every week or whenever they feel like it. also, i have a way to get easy access to becoming a z lister and it easy. It is also not a hack. I don't want to say it to everyone because lockerz will get a way to block it. Sorry. My way has allowed me to invite a lot of people. I can invite up to 100 hundred people per day but I don't have that much time. So I have only invited about 28 people in about 5 days
