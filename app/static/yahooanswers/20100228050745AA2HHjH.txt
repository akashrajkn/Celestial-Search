question about amazon.com ...?
hi,
on this website i have won a $10 amazon gift card.
but i am from the uk.
does any body know if this can be redeemed on amazon.co.uk ?

thanks x

YES
If you are willing to risk it that is up to you but I would think twice as it could be scam of sorts etc
I wouldn't have thought so because of the currency difference.

You only option is to email the Help Desk on the UK site and ask them. 

They will give you a definite answer as to whether you can or not.
