Best blog sites, in your opinion?
I'm writing a blog. Not really about anything in particular, but I enjoy typing way more than writing but I love getting my thoughts down on paper/something permanent.
What are the best, most managable and organized blogs, in your opinion?
Thanks (:

I like to blog myself too, I enjoy using blogger. You should give it a try :)
Wordpress in my opinion is amazing. Its simple to use and alot of people are familiar with it so others can give you suggestions. Another good website is Blogger, which google owns. Have fun blogging!
Wordpress is good.
Best blog sites are real content sites.Most of blogs today copyright content.
Upload regular intervals.
Had most followers and visitors
