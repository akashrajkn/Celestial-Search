tumblr, blogger or wordpress?
I'm trying to decide which site to use to host my blog.  I'm looking for one that has visually appealing templates which are easy to change quickly and has a blackberry application.

Wordpress.org!
Nothing else will do!
You can use wordpress.It is the best and seo friendly.
