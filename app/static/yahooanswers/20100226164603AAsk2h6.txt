hotebar tab comes up when i start firefox?
this weird search bar thing pops up and its really annoying. if you can tell me how to get rid of it i owe you 10!

In Windows XP go to Control Panel, Add Remove programs,remove it from there.

Or in Firefox View and uncheck the toolbar (might be under VIEW>Toolbars)
