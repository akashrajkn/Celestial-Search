How do i delete the account i don't need?
my college board account says that i have another account and i can't sign up to take the SAT because of that. How do i delete the account i don't need? or delete both and create a new one.?

Click on the windows button. Click on your account picture. Click manage another account. Click the account you want to delete. Click delete the account. Bing! your done (the other things you wanna do are all there and obvious)
