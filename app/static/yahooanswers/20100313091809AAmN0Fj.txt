I put wrong billing address when I ordered something online?
I moved and still havent changed my address (bank). I put my current address as my billing address. Will my order get canceled or something? I'm not sure how to fix this.

Just email the co. directly & explain all of this to them.
if it was on a credit card it may be>they run the card to the billing address
then you best contact them and deal with it!
