Does Lockerz really work?
Do they really send the gifts we redeem through PTZ???

lockerz works but its super hard to get points, iv tried so many like points2shop, swagbucks, but their so hard until i found a new site here a link that explains it http://freestuff-traker360.blogspot.com/
Yes, they do, but they go out of stock very fast.

For getting the prizes first I suggest you to use LockerzAlerts - http://www.lockerzalerts.com  service , they will send you text message to your mobile phone when the redemption occurs ! its also FREE !
