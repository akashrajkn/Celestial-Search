Embedding videos on my blog?
I know how to get the youtube embedding code and post it but when I do it cuts off one half of the video - it is blocked by my side bars. 

I'm using eblogger?

All you need to do is copy the "embed code" above the description of the video, then when adding a post in eblogger click the "html" tab and copy and paste the code wherever you would like to video, then it will come up when you publish the post!
