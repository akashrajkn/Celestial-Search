in Hotmail, when I click "back to message" why does it take me to inbox?
When I reply to a mail and hit send, it takes me to a screen that lets me add the email address or go "back to message". When I click back to message, it always takes me back to the inbox!

Is this a setting? I thought back to message meant back to message...

You can change the settings in the options it is very simple all you have to do is open your eyes OK is it very simple ah ?
