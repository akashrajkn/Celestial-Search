Good domain name for sport blog?

As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website/weblog. If you are going to create your blog website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com).  To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your blog online at your purchased domain name.

If you¡¯re going to start your blog at your own domain with different pages, you need a web host providing wordpress.

Take a look at:

There you can reach the three reputable companies that are leaders in the blog/wordpress website hosting industry.
If you are a domainbie, use spinning tools of domaintools.com. This will give you a fair idea what domain is to choose. cheers.
