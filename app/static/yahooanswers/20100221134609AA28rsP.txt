Can we print Deviantart pics on a printer if it's not a paying picture?
If the picture's not on the artist's PRINT section of their profile, can we print it on a printer?

i think....if you can download it and if the image hasn't a watermark, you can print it, open it into a program like photoshop, gimp also paint and microsoft word........^^...

I  hope you like my answer...sorry for something wrong in my english...i'm learning...^^:
