is making an account on zedge safe and does it cost you?
i need to know if it takes away money on your phone just in case!!!

I have a zedge account and it is free, unless you get a premium one. I have a mac though, so viruses aren't a problem, but it seems to be pretty safe.
the other answer is stupid and dangerous.  MACS GET VIRUSES TOO!  geesh
Quite safe but download any themes/games ring-tones ect on your pc and scan the file with your anti-virus programme, then copy it to you phone and install it that way. It doesn't cost anything unless you access the site via your mobile phones internet browser, but free if you do it via Wifi
