Paypal shipping label creator charged me and messed up my label!!?
Hi I used paypal's shipping label creator and I paidfor and printed out my label, however I realized that instead of Seattle, it said Seatac. Assuming this was my fault I remade the label, making sure to spell it correctly, however, When I purchased the label again, It once again changed Seattle to Seatac. Why is it doing this?? Is there any way to get my money back for the labels?

Best way to get this resolved is to contact PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/us/contactus
