Where are all those Internet and telephone cables?
Where are Internet and telephone cables carrying intercity telecommunication traffic located? Are they under highways, under roads, under railway lines, on electric poles?

And besides, has every ISP its own parallel nationwide network, or does it just lease the already installed Internet cables owned and by another company? Wouldn't it too expensive for a new company to lay down its own cables across the country when they are already there? Thanks.

The phone & cable companies allow ISP's to use their existing lines. That's why people lose their internet connection when there's a cable outage.

Of course, there are satellite-fed ISP's, like HughesNet, but severe weather can interrupt those signals, too.
