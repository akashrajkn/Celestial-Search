are YOU going to anthrocon this year?
i kinda want to meet a few furs at anthro con that i'll know so that i'm not just wandering around all shy and afraid to talk to people soo..... are you going to anthrocon this year? would you be willing to allow me to join your wander-about group?

Anthrocon is the world's largest Furry (fans of anthropomorphic animals) convention, held in Pittsburgh, PA on June 24-27, 2010. I'm looking forward to attending again this year.

I've been going to Anthrocon every year since it started way back in 1997. At first, I didn't know anyone there either and have always been kind of shy myself, but over the years I've gotten over that and made a lot of friends. A good way to meet people is to volunteer and help out at the convention... that's what I did when I started (carrying supplies and helping assemble the art show). Eventually I volunteered so much they put me on staff. -:)  You can meet a wide variety of people and get a good sense of the inner workings of the convention while volunteering. 

Or, if you want to meet new folks in a relaxed atmosphere, there are some social events like the gaming track or Thursday night social mixer or dances in the evenings. 

I don't really have a wander-around group at Anthrocon because it's a working convention for me, I have to run around escorting the media and such. It's still a lot of fun though!
