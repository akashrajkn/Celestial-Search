I have a Skype account, but not a webcam. If my friend has a webcam, can i still do "video call" with them?


Ya you should still be able to and then you can see them but they won't be able to see you (obviously)
Yes, you can see him, he can't see you.
Yes, you can still video call with them. Since you don't have a webcam all they will see is a blank box.
