what are some photosharing websites where people can pay u to download your pics?
I heard there are some but I don't know what they are? What are they?

There are tons of them.

Facebook is one of them.

Also, Multiply.com

Photobucket.com is one of the largest ones I think.

Deviantart.com

I have what I consider to be some nice photos but no one has ever asked to buy one, and yet tourists are always pulling up to take pics of the windmills and the San Jacinto 10,000 ft snow capped mountain just south of my house.  I have a picture of that mtn when it was totally engulfed in flames from 2 years ago ... and with snow ... and without snow ... 

Sometimes I think people just want to take their own but what if they need one for a book cover or magazine?  

I'll be checking back to see if you get any more suggestions on here since I am seriously getting ready to upload about 1000 of my best pics to someONE somewhere ... just not sure who yet.
