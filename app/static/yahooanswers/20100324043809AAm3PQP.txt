Is 'Now Download All' a site worth joining?
It seems to have more documents available than other torrent sites but can find little info about it on google. It costs about ?25 to sign up, which is value if it does what it says on the tin. Or is it mainly junk downloads or a scam? Thanks

No..it is full of virus, malware, trogans and spyware.
