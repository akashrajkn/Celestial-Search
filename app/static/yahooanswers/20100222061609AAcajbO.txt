Anyone know is bux.to real or is a scam site?
how much money i have to gain in order to transfer it to alert-pay?
if you know other sites like bux tell me.
please help!!!

bux.to is a scam, don't invest in that one.  Here are some legit PTC sites that I use personally, you get paid out via PayPal or AlertPay.
