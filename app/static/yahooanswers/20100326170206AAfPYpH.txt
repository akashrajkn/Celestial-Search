Which is your favorite Internet Connection : ADSL, DSL, or Cable?


cable
adsl
DSL is the fastest.......
dial up.... ohh i mean cable.
i like wi-fi cuz its free and its fast! 200-500kbps!
Cable. Too bad you didnt mention fiber. I'd love to have that down here!
i like cable better, its faster and much better quality for me so right now i am using a broadband by cricket. its ok, but it's the best thing i can afford right now. good luck.
