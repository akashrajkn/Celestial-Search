DEMONOID!!!!!!!!!!!!?
I have been going to Demonoid every day for a while and it seems as though they are not opening up their registrations. Unfortunately there is one specific file on Demonoid that I cannot file anywhere else. If anyone would be kind enough to send me an invitation code that would be amazing. roboman08@gmail.com

We won't be helping you with illegal activities. Though thanks for the e-mail address; I'll send it to a few spambots.
No, I'm good.
Not all files are copyrighted, since you don`t know which file the asker is seeking you shouldn`t be calling him/her a thief.
You will get every file from thepiratebay.org, for demonoid registration keep checking on fridays.
