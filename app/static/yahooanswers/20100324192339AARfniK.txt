Free-web hosting that allows uploading of self-made templates?
I make my own templates using both frontpage and bluevoda, and I find most freewebsites fussy uploading them. Any free webhosting that has a smooth system for this?

Look into opera unite!
That's what i use.
You should look for a web hosting with FTP access. A good one is Hostgator.

You can get free Hostgator account by following this guide: http://internetcouponcodes.org/hostgator
Sky.UK.Net provides web hosting for all templates. They offer free web hosting in both Windows and Linux platforms.
