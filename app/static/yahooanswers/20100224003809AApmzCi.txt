Hotmail, Home options, others see my email messages?
Hi everyone, i want to know, do people in my network see my email messages when they visit my profile? (Home menu).  Because i visited a friend's profile, and i can see his last email messages. How to hide it? Is it because of sharing or he did something wrong? Do you know how to stop it?
