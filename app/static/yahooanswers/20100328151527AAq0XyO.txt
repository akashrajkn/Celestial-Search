Does anyone know of any good free Proxy servers, that wont mess up my new laptop?
I want to watch some TV shows in England on the internet, through channel 4 and BBC 1's websites. These sites will not allow me too watch full episodes as I am not in the right region. 
I live in the United States, moved here from England and I miss my TV shows that I love.

Use the Personal VPN, http://www.surfbouncer.com and log into their UK servers. All UK programming will be available. Not free but it actually works.
