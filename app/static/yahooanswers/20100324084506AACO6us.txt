Is all just psychological. Whatever you think you're supposed to do drives you mad. Of course the picture on it self can't do you any harm.
Smile.jpg or Smile.dog is a very long and winding case of bad Creepypasta. A Weeaboo obviously thought it would be super awesome to create a story that was very similar in content to The Ring, with the same prank infamy of The Grifter. The resulting urban legend is about a college reporter who hears rumours of a picture that makes people kill themselves and causes epilepsy despite being a still image.
