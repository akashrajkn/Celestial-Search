Download episodes of Australian show?
What is the best FREE program to use to download whole episodes as AVI Files (.avi) ??

Full episodes should not legally be available on the web
It is the commercials that pay for the show to be made and if people are not watching the show on their actual TV set, ratings will plummet, advertisers will take their money elsewhere and the show might get cancelled because there is no money to continue making it.
I am surprised that the hordes of people asking how to watch full shows on the web do not realize how shows are financed
In my opinion, stay away from Limewire.  The program itself is not the problem; just the typical users and the problems that you will encounter by getting files from them.

uTorrent is a stable program.  And torrent is a better system than Limewire (Direct P2P).

We assume you undersand the legality of downloading copyright material.  Do so at your own risk.
