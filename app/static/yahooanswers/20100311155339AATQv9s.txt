What wrong with my Firefox browser?
ok soooo I reinstalled my comp with win7 and started using Firefox obviously (cus internet exploder sucks) and lately it's been bugging out with links, an example of this would be if I click a link to another page for example, all it does is come up with a download window that has nothing it in and when I try and click the link again after cancelling that, it does nothing. It only seems to happen when I'm on Youtube.

also, before I get any comment saying I have a virus, malware etc, there are 2 thing I should say. 1:I've not been on any dodgy sites at all, in fact the most dodgy site I've been on is newgrounds if you wish to call that dodgy.
2: I have done multiple scans using Avast! antivirus (on a full scan), IObit security 360 (on a full scan) and Spybot Search and destroy, and found nothing. (all of these programs are legit, not scareware)

It may simply be a case of firefox base files simply becoming fragmented, but I'm still unsure as this has happened before and defragging didn't seem to do anything. any ideas?
Stupid answers that contradict what I've said about internet (exploder) aren't helpful.

use internet explorer, :)
First thing i'd do is download Microsoft Security Essentials & run a full scan with that - it knows Windows 7 better than any of the others.

Download the latest Firefox, (3.6) that fixes a few security flaws. Totally uninstall your version of firefox beforehand & make sure you click 'delete all user settings' to clear the registry. The built in software uninstaller isn't perfect so get Revo http://www.revouninstaller.com/ - its a trial but you get it full for 30 days.
