Internet Explorer Help?
Hello,

I have windows 7 with the current updated internet explorer. I am having trouble with passwords.

Lastweek I was able to log into my facebook page and not have to enter a password. Today it will remember my username but it won't enter the password.

It works fine on anyother site. I checked the auto complete and its checked for saving passwords.
I didn't even log out of facebook. If i choose to close the page i am stuck re-entering everything.

I don't even get a box that asked me to save info on facebook anymore..any help would be great.

Also,
Is firefox any good? is it safe to use? and how does it compare to windows ie?

thanks

Firefox is sooo much better than Internet Explorer, IE is shit.
You should upgrade to IE8.
Try this (on either):
Internet Explorer users, do this first:
Tools> Internet options> Security> tick the "Internet" icon> Security level box> set slider to "Medium high"> OK out.  Then:

IE (pre-8): Go to the site first> Tools> Internet options> Security> tick the 'Trusted' icon> Sites> Add> ok> out
Note this setting may permit undesirable 'Active scripting' or other server based action: use with caution, especially if you have 'Active content' allowed.
Again, supplemental blockers, in browsers mainly, may have to be muted, or 'site allowed'.

IE 8:
Go to the site needing approval & copy the URL from address bar, then:
Tools> Internet Options> Privacy> Sites> paste that URL into top line> Allow> OK> OK.
The "Pop-up Blocker" may also need to be modified to accommodate the site. 
Tools> Internet Options> Pop up blocker heading> Settings> again, paste that URL into the slot> Close> OK.

General cookie settings should be:
Tools> Internet Options> Privacy> Advanced: tick "Override..."; Allow 1st party cookies; Allow session Cookies  ?BLOCK 3rd Party cookies> OK> OK.

IE (any breed) is a steaming pile of bull plop.
Firefox is 2 orders of magnitude better and safer (with the proper add-on's).
stop using Firefox and IE
Install Apple Safari,it rules!! It's much faster than Firefox.
P.S don't use Chrome,its all hype and it lacks security!!
I'm a browser expert,so you can count on me :)
Use Safari
