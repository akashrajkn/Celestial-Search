There are things I accidentally committed to buy on Ebay, but cannot pay for them, because they are Pay pal?
How do I "uncommit" to buying them?
Wait, I could really go to jail for this?
I swear to god it was an accident!

Anything on ebay is paid through paypal, unless seller will allow a credit/debit card for purchase. I tried myself to uncommitt at one point but never was able too. Try contacting ebay personally and ask them to remove it.
just message seller, and tell them you apologize, but u didnt mean to purchase the items, he will do something and cancel it, i done it before i bought something didnt have the money.....and  i message seller and said i cant buy it.
There is no "accident".  If you bid on an item, you committed to buying that item.  Always read the listing entirely and understand its contents before you bid.  

If you do not complete the transaction, the seller will still be charged fees as if the item was sold.  That's not fair to the seller.

If you want the item, sign up for Paypal.  It's easy, free to use as a buyer, and with a credit card your purchases are protected.

If you do not want the item, contact the seller.  Let them know you made a mistake.  See what they say.  Chances are, they will not be pleased with you.

No, you won't go to jail for this.
Your going to the internets jails!
i avoided pay pal for years but now you do not have a choice unless the seller would accept a check or money order you can ask.
