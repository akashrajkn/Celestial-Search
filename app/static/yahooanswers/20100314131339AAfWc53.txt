Internet connection problem, please help?
My mom's laptop is connected to the internet, but not to our ISP to our neighbor's one. When I click 'Search for Available Wireless Networks' it says that it cannot find any at this time, yet my computer is connected, along with my sister's and I can see our modem is fully connected. 
Can you guys troubleshoot or maybe help me out, thanks.
Im not trying to get onto my neighbors. Im trying to connect to MY modem.

Maybe your neighbour has made their connection private with a password
