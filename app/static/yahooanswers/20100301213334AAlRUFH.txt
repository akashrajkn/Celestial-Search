Why can't I upload pictures from photoshop to tinypic?
I have been trying to upload my photoshop pictures to show my friends but they always fail to upload can you help

Make sure the size in MB is small enough. If it isn't try resizing your pictures.
make sure you are saving the file as a .jpeg, .jpg, .png, or .gif. if you save a file as a .psd, it will not upload correctly. also make sure the image is not too large.
