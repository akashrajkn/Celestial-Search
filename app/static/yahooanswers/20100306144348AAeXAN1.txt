Does my computer have a virus ?
For the past few months, everytime I've gotten on Myspace, this fake Antivirus website would pop up, saying it was searching my computer for viruses and that I've been infected. I ignored it because I knew it was fake and I immediately closed it out. But starting today, something strange has started popping up. I got on my computer earlier today, and some website having to do with wq32 kept popping up, and just recently when I was on Myspace editing my page, this popup box kept popping up. It said "Are You Human?' &+ had two choices, "OK", or "Cancel" I kept clicking OK, and it kept popping up no matter how many times I pressed it. Eventually it took me to this website called http://podmena.us and required that I type in some type of login information. I'm getting extremely worried now, because I had another computer crash due to viruses and I really don't want to lose everything again. I do have McAfee Virus protection, but it has expired and my computer is not fully protected. Can somebody please let me know what might be wrong and what I can do to fix it ? Thank you !

yes it has a virus . honestLy i donno how can we fix the probLem.
Sounds to me like the protection you had on was a trial version.The answer is updating and keeping an eye on the web based pages you go to. Another thing is you just may be getting the minor affects of "Mal-ware" or the other viruses that come with bad luck. 
 Here is the download link to the Malwarebytes, it may help rid the problematic occurrences

Another thing is, You may want to back up your PC up with an external hard drive incase the problem gets worse and formating is the only option.
