how does demonoid work with television shows?
will someone tell me what seeds are and what i do with the torrent after i download, i want to download episodes of the office and am not sure what to do with the torrent

one or more people "seed" the file, meaning that they upload the file for you to download. torrents are downloaded with torrent clients like utorrent. torrents themselves are not illegal. but what you want to do is.
