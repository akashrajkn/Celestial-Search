where online can I find a copy of my name change court paperwork?
ok i need that paperwork from 3 years ago. i want to save myself a stressful trip downtown. I can't find the final papers in my mess of an office. i filed in Sacramento, California.

the http://www.saccourt.ca.gov/ site says you can search for public records. i can't find my documents there. anyone have a clue where i can get a copy? i know it is a public document. there has to be a way to get it online. i will never change my name again, this has been the most frustrating experience. i just wanted to go back to my birth name. why didn't i put the correct name on my divorce paperwork. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. help!

I am sad you felt the need to change your name, but this will never change the person for if I was close I would come to the office and help. Relax your mind and enjoy the Gift of life.
Hi,

If you have lost the document showing your name change or want to revert back to your birth name you can do this through a Deed Poll document. It is a relatively cheap process and will show your name change from your current name back to your former name or another name of your choice.

You can apply for a Deed Poll document online for as little as ?29. If you cannot find your just order another one. Probably be a lot less stressful than hunting all over the place for yours!

It can all be done over the internet as well which will be easier probably-hope this helps

Good Luck
