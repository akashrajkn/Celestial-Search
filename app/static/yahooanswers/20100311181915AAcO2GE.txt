point of chatroulette?
today i went on chatroulette.com to find out what its all about. i clicked new game without reading much of the info, n i got his dude just staring at the screen he was old. i hit deny for the use of my camera, and when i saw that guy pop up i ex-d it all out. i was scarred-ish. this seems kinda pointless to me, and most people would probably get really immature about it and go nude or some stupid stuff. so what do you think its for.

I think it's for accidentally viewing random male genitalia. 

That's really all you see on it, anyway.
ChatLack.com is like chatroulette but with photos instead of webcam.
