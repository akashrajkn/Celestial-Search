Is there a service or website that allows me to gather any sort of public record/information i need in one?
place? like if i needed to find out who stayed in a certain hotel on a given night or who owned a trailer in a trailer park in a certain town between two given years, just random stuff like that. I'd pay anything for this service or website. Basically I'm looking to track down certain people from my past to inform them of some things but I forgot their names, and some of that random information are just the keys I need to find certain people.

Most of this data, even if someone keeps them, is considered to be private information, and it would be somewhat difficult to get it into your own hands. You'd have to either contact the owner of the hotel/trailer park or whoever might have this information and either hope they're nice people and hand it over to you (free or at a charge) or you'd need a court order and/or warrant, which seems like overkill to me.

There are websites to look up personal information, for example, like PeopleLookup, but I doubt you'd get that detailed information from anyone.
