Shipping time from Singapore?
How long does it take for something to be shipped from singapore to Kansas City, KS via Singapore Post air mail?  I ordered something on e-bay and it was shipped on March 12th.

All right as to shipping via Air then ground (years ago one could joke as to the "Slow Boat From China". In this case as to shipping details the most would be 14 days. However I would have thought that it should be there by now as this is not the height of the shipping season.

So by way of ground 4 weeks, by air 2 to 4 weeks so it has been only 10 days.
