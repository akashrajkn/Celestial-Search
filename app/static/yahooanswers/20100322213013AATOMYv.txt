Why is everyone saying pasta on omegle?


mootles.
pasta
Maybe its just one of those temporary internet memes, like playing Omegle Warfare. It'll stop soon, and before you know it people will start saying "noodles"!
Rules 1 & 2.
because it tastes so good with sage.
Someone just said pasta to me and then when I clicked for the next conversation there was something saying this is omegle, if anyone puts pasta then they're trying to give you a virus or something along those lines but I honestly don't know if that's true or someone's being an idiot
They're asking for cyber sex. Urban Dictionary it.
