Hello

Filters like Websense is pretty good at what they do and definitely system admins are keeping a log of the sites you visit even proxies, so theres always a risk.

I love taking risks and I use http://www.cityradiorwanda.biz/ proxy from pagemod.com
signup for their subscription service or mail them at pagemod@gmail.com for new ones.
try these proxies
