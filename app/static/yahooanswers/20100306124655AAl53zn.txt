Once I have put an item on sale on ebay can I add a buy it now price?

yeah people have bidded on it but someones offering me a lot of money for it but he wants it on buy in now so he can purchase it straight away.

If it hasn't been bid on yet.
yes as long as there is no bids you can change all the details of the item too..
you can make changes to your item by clicking on revise your item and then edit it.You can add buy it now only if nobody has put a bid on it and the item must still have 1 day of sale still left.
As long as you put the buy now price when you put the item on site this is ok there,s alot who do this and get better results.
Not now you can't, once it has had a bid you cannot add a "buy it now" price you have to let the auction run its course. You could have changed it before it had bids.

This has happened to me on many occasions, be very wary of people making offers like this, they are often not genuine and don't pay or leave negative feedback for you afterwards. 

Tell this person that if they want to bid in the usual way they are welcome.
Firstly no you  can't add a BIN once it has bids on it; but you can end it to sell to the highest bidder- so ask him to bid to the agreed amount and you will end the listing.

Bet he dosen't because what the offer of a' lot of money' will be a fake Paypal email to say you have the money ONCE you send a tracking  number- and send to Nigeria
SCAM
Let the auction run, you may get more
Ask him where he wnts it sent to before the auction ends (Nigeria) 
Put him on your Block Buyer List
