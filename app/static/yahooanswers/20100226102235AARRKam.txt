Info about internet plan?
I need to know about any internet plan for home use with much surf and download. Not to worry about surfing time, is there any plan there completing the requirements ? With a little detail will be good, like charges and rentals etc.

Friend, 
I am using Airtel for 3 years, and i have no problems...Lots of offers available to you..
Call airtel broadband helpline number, ask them to forward you the document which has list of plan details with informations.
You wil get lots of info there....

If airtel network is not available, opt for BSNL...they too have lots of options for home plans..
