Problem in downloading in Mozilla Firefox?
when i was downloading a movie in mozilla, im so glad that it may continue to download even i turn off the pc and continue it tomorrow, but when i continue it, after a hour or a minute, it stops downloading! how about that? what happen? i cannot continue it na,

some servers, like rapidshare, megaupload.... blocks you to continue the download.
mozilla firefox does not support that resume support.... 
use downloader software.... like Free download manager... its free.
