Come on, can't you think of better things to do? And less dangerous things? Read a book. Surf other places on the web. Watch TV-the Olympics are on, for God's sake! Harry Potter's a good series. Read it, or read it again. mylifeisaverage.com and notalwaysright.com are good websites.
there will be a start button on the top left corner after it is done "entering" which takes a really long time because the servers have been down
Porno.
I heard they crashed due to hackers. should be back up in a few days.
