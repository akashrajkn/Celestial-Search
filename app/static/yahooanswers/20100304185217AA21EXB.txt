How long does it take to receive a payment to Paypal account when selling on Ebay?
Im selling an item on Ebay and I have a few bids on it already.This is my first time selling and I was wondering once the bidding winner wins and they pay thru Paypal will I get an email or what?Will the money show up in Paypal quickly or will it take business days to show up?Also when they pay everything is done automaticlly right,for example I dont have to give my email to the winning bidder?What are the exact steps,is there anything else I need to do?Sorry for asking so many questions.Thank you.

When the item is sold, you will need to send the bidder a payment request as soon as you can, unless they've already paid.  If they've already sent the money to your PayPal e-mail address (remember to make sure you have the PayPal e-mail address registered with eBay otherwise they won't ba able to pay, and you'll have to inform the seller of the PP e-mail address) then PP will e-mail you and you'll need to accept the payment, which will be credited to your account then.  Once you've received payment remember to inform the bidder when you'll be sending the item, and then e-mail them once you've sent the item so they know it's on the way.

To withdraw money from the PP account it can take anything up to 10 working days to appear in your bank account.
