do i have to wait a few days to buy something online after setting up a pay-pal?


You have to wait for Paypoo to take a small amount from your bank (usually just overa pound) to verify your details. This is sent back when you use your account.
yes, paypal has to receive the item and the cash first from the 2 parties, then paypal will email you saying theyve got the item ready and also your cash, they will ask you if you want the item
once you verify your account you should be able to use it straight away,it takes 7-10 days for money to clear but if you have a visa or debit card you can pay/transfer straight away, look in your account settings for more info,it tells you what to do.
