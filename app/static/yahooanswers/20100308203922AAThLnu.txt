Does anyone know anything about Mozilla Firefox?
Ohk, my little sister installed a yahoo tool bar to both firefox and explorer, so I uninstalled it but after I did I noticed that every time I opened a new tab it would go to this web site http://search.yahoo.com/?fr=freeze&type=W3i_NA,132,3_6,Tab%20Search,20100209,6374,0,15,0 But I want it to open up to a blank tab. I tried using add ons to change it but still no luck so help please! its driving me bananas haha. I've thought about just redownloading firefox but I'm not sure if I'll lose all my Bookmarks. So any help would be great. Keep in mind that is my tabs not my homepage I know how to change that.

No, dont redownload firefox!
I had the same problem,

Okay, so go to Tools
Then click on Add Ons
Then go on Extensions
It probably says "My.Freeze.com Net Assistant" as one of the options
Have it selected, and then click on Uninstall

That gets you back to having a blank tab when you click for a new tab.
You dont have to uninstall the Yahoo toolbar, this is separate from it.
