Why doesn't my Webcam connect to Chatroulette?
I click on "Allow" when it asks but it still only shows a black box under where it says "You". My webcam works though.
It doesn't have a troubleshooter.

Maybe see the Chatroulette troubleshooter.

Editted: Maybe your webcam just doesn't work on particular websites. Not everything on the internet is perfect xDD
