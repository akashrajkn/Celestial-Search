What does following someone on twitter do?
I don't have anyone to follow. I'm mainly curious about the site but I don't know what to do.

It means that when you log on to Twitter, you will see the latest posts ("tweets") of those you follow, listed in chronological order from the most recent.

A lot like what happens when you log in to Facebook, except the posts are much shorter.
For example, if you follow http://twitter.com/mswindows you will see tweets from Microsoft Windows in your feed when you log into twitter

If you want tweets there are websites that enhance your tweets. Be careful what you wish for. You can end up with 2-300 People in days.. Well twitter is people who send SMS "tweets" to a Forum+ Cellphones. The ones who "follow" receive the "tweets"..
Luckily you can follow one person at a time and not get THEIR tweets too. But thats what makes the network so HUGE. It only took a few people to get into the thousands. As we know know its in the Millions WORLDWIDE..
