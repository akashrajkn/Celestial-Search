Don't you just hate when someone leaves chat room all of the sudden?
I mean you're chatting with one person and all of the sudden *puff* he's gone. He/She doesn't even say "You're boring." or "I got to go." or something like that, just melts into tin air. Have you experienced it? and don't you hate that?

Yes. I mean there's nothing worse than when
People have to use the bathroom - answer an unexpected knock at the door - answer an unexpected phone call which might turn out to be genuinely important.
Why do you seem to think the other person's world revolves around you?
Yes. I hate it.
