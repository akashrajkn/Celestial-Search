I'd like to get more activity on my site, any ideas on how to do this?
http://n-raged.com/forums/

I don't have much money to spend for advertising, although I am trying to use a few vouchers for advertising.  So where can I spam my site at to give it a boost of activity?  I've managed to get some friends to sign up but that hasn't done much good.

Reasonable ideas are welcome (insulting or trolling responses will get reported).

Mate every webmaster needs traffic, no wonder, you seem to have a very good website, All you got to is to expose your website to the readers to who the website is meant for.Try to start something new in the forum ,something like traffic exchange , bookmarking and all. Also comment on others blogs, I own a website here on http://www.ByteChip.com just see the response I get ,  its all because  I comment on their blog, so start exposing your website , submit your websites to the directories. And you can contact me in my website for further help, im glad to help you
