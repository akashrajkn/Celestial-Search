How much can you earn per month from a blog with average traffic?

Was I supposed to add "if you have Adsense, banners and who knows what other kinds of ads"?

Nothing.
If your idea is to earn by showing ads from ad programs like Adsense, Kontera, Adbrite etc. then your earnings will depend on the number of clicks you manage to get on your displayed ads. On an average, if your blog content is good, means if the content shows good context ads, then if you have 300 blog visitors then you will have 2-6 clicks on your ads. Studies show ads on websites have a click ratio of around 2 percent, thus for every 100 visitors, one can expect to get 2 clicks on ads.This translates into, 1 or 1.2 dollars a day for a 300 visitor a day blog.
