where do major websites start?
where do the major sites start? like youtube or yahoo, or google? where do they begin? i know at the free sites that they can buy one and have their own domin name, and do whatever they want, but i wanna know where they all start at. i know that they may not all start at the same place, but what is the main one that they use?
but i mean like you can do whatever you want to it??? like move anything anywhere or change whatever you want?

Major web sites start like any other web site.  You buy a domain name, you get a host (place to put the files on).  Then you make a web site that people want.  Do some advertising, and that's about it.
