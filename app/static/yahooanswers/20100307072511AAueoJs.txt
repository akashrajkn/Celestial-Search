can i post a picture of someone else on the internet?
legally anyway?

I mean he sent the photo to me afterall.
What do you think?

You can't post pictures of people unless they're smoking hot 18 yr old blonde girls. That's the rules..I don't make them.
As long as its not child porn or anything like that, I think you should be alright. I mean heck, whats Facebook, Myspace, and every other social media site out there that allows you to tag photos of people, right?

You should be alright, just make sure its not going to anger them (for any reason) because they might not want their photo on the internet, depending what it is, but if its a normal photo, go for it!

Ethically, the answer is NO.

Basically its common sense really, you won't like it if someone post your picture on the Internet without your permission right?

You get the picture?

Try to get permission from the author of the photograph before you post their picture on the Internet.
with his consent i guess?
YES,YOU CAN
Get this person to send you an email giving you permission to do this and print it out. It is almost like a Model Release. That way you are fairly safe to post it provided you do not use it in a demeaning way or as revenge or inappropriately. It has to be used appropriately.

You just can't post peoples pictures, just because you want to. Some one will get mad and take you to court. Not preaching, just a simple warning or caution.
