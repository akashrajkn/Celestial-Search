Is Encyclopedia Dramatica illegal to be on?
Most of the content on the site is kinda... offensive. i was told by wikipedia to go on the site for information on memes and I was just wondering if it's illegal to be navigating the site because this page said the FBI was watching me and something about underaged girls.

if you think it is, then dont go on it. i like going to that site. :<
It's probably not illegal, but it might not be something you want to browse at work.
...Why would it be illegal? If a site is illegal to be on, it's because the site itself is illegal, and thus would get shut down. Unless it's only illegal in your country, which is true for some stuff... but anyway, no of course it isn't.
