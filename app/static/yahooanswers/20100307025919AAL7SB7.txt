how can I upload a powerpoint video to my "Webs" site (formerly freewebs)?


Upload the PowerPoint video to Youtube first,then embed the embed code to your webpage.
I think an article named "6 Approaches to Putting PowerPoint Presentation on Web"  may help you solve the problem.
Go to the article source: http://www.dvd-ppt-slideshow.com/ppt-to-dvd-tips/put-powerpoint-on-web.html
You can either convert your PowerPoint to video or flash(with a smaller file size and high compatibility with different browsers) to upload it to your web. 

Here is an article introduces how to create web-friendly flash from PowerPoint:
