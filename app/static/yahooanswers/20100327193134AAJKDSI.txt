my browser keeps going to webresults6.org?
every time i do a Google search and click on one of the links my browser will go to webresults6.org instead of the page its supposed to...it works fine if i type the website in the address bar and only does it if i try to search something in a search engine then try to click on one of the results.
oh yea it is also a fresh install of windows XP professional
and this happens on all my browsers...firefox, IE, Opera, and google chrome

its probably a virus meant to draw more hits and more money to their website
reset your browser's cache? That's how I fixed a similar problem on mine.
