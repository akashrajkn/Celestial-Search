I can't log onto aim with pidgin..help!!!?
So for some reason, i cant log into pidgin using my aim account..this is weird because i downloaded it before on a another computer, and it worked just fine..when i try logging in, it gives me this message: Received unexpected response from http://api.oscar.aol.com/aim/startOSCARSession: useTLS=1 is not allowed for non secure requests.   help, por favor??

See pidgin's main site:  http://pidgin.im

Here is a copy in case it goes away:
