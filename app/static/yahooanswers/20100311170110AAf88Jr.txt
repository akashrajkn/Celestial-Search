now i have no idea what might have happened but can someone please tell me if I have a virus on my comp or not?

If you were stupid enough to actually go to a link on 4Chan, you deserve any virus you may have received.
No. It's not a virus.

Don't click random links.
it's from anontalk, it contains CP and sends your IP address to the authorities. the owner of anontalk is trying to be 1337H4Xx0r and get anonymous V& left and right. i seriously suggest you get it out of your system, as this isn't the first time this has been poasted and there are rumors of it doing it's job quite well in the past. ask around on the boards where you first saw it and hope someone can help
