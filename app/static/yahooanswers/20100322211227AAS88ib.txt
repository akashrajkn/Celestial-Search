How can I get people to know about my website?
I finally finished making my website. Only problem is, I don't know how to get people to know about it. I'm totally clueless about this. Thanks for your help in advance!

There's some good tips in the site below on how to get traffic..
Go on forums and leave threads about it. Especially forums sites that are related to yours.
Ask similar websites to allow you to put a link to your site on their sites.  Put a link to your site in all outgoing emails as your signature!
One way is to advertise it on other websites. However, this costs money.
I know people ask others at forums to check out their website (but make sure you know the forum rules), which is often free and easy. Another way is to notify another website similar in field about yours. If successful, you could get an article about your new website on theirs, possibly attracting their readers to visit consistently.
