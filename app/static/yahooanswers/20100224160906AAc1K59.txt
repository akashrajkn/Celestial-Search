What can I do about my pipe that just came in the mail?
I just received a smoking pipe in the mail today from an auction on eBay, and the seller didn't send it in a box or anything to ship it safely.

When I opened the package, the end of the pipe fell out onto my lap, along with the stem.  Is there any way to safely keep the end of the pipe back on there?  Because I do not want to buy another pipe, or send it back for that matter.

Is the stem broken?  If so, you will need to find a person that repairs pipes, not an easy task these days.
