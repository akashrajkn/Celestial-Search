wich is better firefox or opera?
Im just curios which ones faster and just all around better!

Firefox is way better and faster
Opera is supposed to be faster, but Firefox has the best addons API.
Firefox is better and faster and also you have a lot of add ons if you choose
if you want speed, google chrome is currently the fastest available browser, but being relatively new, it is not yet compatible with everything, but because it is gaining a sizable market share it will probably be included in the future.

Firefox is also very fast and is compatible with almost all applications, and it also has a large community meaning lots of plugins, support when you have problems, ect.

Firefox is all around a substantial amount better than opera.

On my computer I use both Chrome and firefox, but i tend to use chrome more.
