Has anyone installed Internet Explorer 9?
I haven't installed internet explorer 8 yet, already IE 9 is available (test drive)

http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/

What do you think of IE 9? Will you install it?

nope, i use google chrome. it looks nice, very easy to use, and is reallyyy fast
i'm still using 7 and waiting for them to get the bugs worked out of ie8 still ! I hate to see how bad ie9 will be? :)
i just did the flyingimages test on firefox, ie 8, and ie 8 64 bit, 64 bit got 7 fps, ie8 got 3 fps, firefox got around 45, im just downloaded ie9, good news, it got 60 fps and beat firefox on every other test, can't wait for the actual thing now :D
nope,,,,,,,,,
