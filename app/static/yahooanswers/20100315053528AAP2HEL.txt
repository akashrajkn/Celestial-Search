What happened to diaryland.com?
O_O I had diary entries there going back to 2003. It was like a history of my entire life since I was 13.

Now when I go there it's giving me one of those silly fake directories you see when the domain name hasn't been bought yet.

Does anyone know what happened? Did they announce they were going down? I feel like I just lost a flipping library of writings and I'm really upset.
Rally: Hmm, I can't get into mine with this method, but your post was reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I hope you're right, we'll see what happens over the next day or two...

i can't get on there either!! i'm soo worried. if my diary is gone, i'll actually cry aha, i need it.
my boyfriend tried getting onto my diary link from work and he said it was showing up.
so maybe it's just down for a while?
i hope so anyway!
same as me. It was okay like.. 5-6 hours ago, now it's like what you said. 
Let's wait for 2-3 days
I also wish to know what's going on! Have been using it since 2002... My last logon on was like 24 hours ago and now I got that weird page as well :(
I panicked all day about it, but it's OK! Supposedly there was a lapse renewing the domain name or something and it's going to take a little bit to get everything working again (I don't know if this is true or not). 

More importantly, how to get your diary (or anyway how I got mine back):

Empty your browser's cache.
Restart your computer.
It should now work. My diary was locked and I had to unlock it to access it. I assume if there was a lapse and renewal of the domain name that things got shifted around. 

OK, back to backing it all up. 
^_^
i've been trying to logon for the past 4 hours, and it's not working!!! i'm stressing out.
