Which browser should I update to for maximum safety/ enjoyment of Internet usage?
I am being prompted by You tube and other sites that my browser will no longer be supported and that I should upgrade to a new one like Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc. Which browser is best overall in terms of security, content, ease- of -use etc? Thanks for any info.

Firefox is far and away the best browser available right now for general use.
I have multiple browsers and use each one at different times. If you have the disk space, it's worth trying them all out.

Firefox & Opera are the best. Chrome has some security flaws.
Google Chrome is the best. Its security is okay. Its very easy to use in my opinion because its simple. And theres cool stuff on it. If you wanna make the security better on it then you might just wanna install an antivirus.
