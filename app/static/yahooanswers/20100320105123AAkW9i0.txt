Has anyone noticed deviant art is not working well?
Its extremely slow and for me, it won't even let me go on he site "Oops! This link appears to be broken"

Have you had difficulties too?
Or is my computer messed.

Same for me! It's ridiculously slow, and I refreshed the page--still nothing! When it finally loaded, a white screen with blue links to parts of the website came up. Then I refreshed the page again, and I got the error 'Failed to open page'. Perhaps they're doing some serious site maintenance.
yeah i actaully only got on yahoo answers to see if anyone else was expirencing this. i typed in yaoi nothing. wondering, yuri so then im like wait.... i typed in fish nothing, cow nothing just regular thigns and so its good to know im not alone
