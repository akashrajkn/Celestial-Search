yes it does!

I love answering kindle questions, it's by far one of my favorite devices that i keep in my bag.

For starters and most importantly I worn the Kindle 2 (soon to be upgrading to the Kindle DX), and it is easy for me to say I love it! I think I've read over 20 books so far.

There are other reviews on the Kindle 2 here:

I love my Kindle because it has helped me improve a lot on my efficiency and utilize my time. Before I owned the Kindle, waiting time like when I'm waiting for friends or waiting for shuttle bus or some thing like that is simply wasted. Now I just need to bring the Kindle 2 along with me. Another thing I like the most is the text-to-speech function, which means I can "read" books without even holding or looking at the Kindle. Now I like to use this function when I've myself busy on some boring things, say when I'm on the step machine or doing some housework...

I like reading and at the beginning I missed a bit on the feeling of reading books. But now I love to hold the Kindle, the e-ink seems to work very well, it is really like reading books... Now I often read with the Kindle for several hours but I don't feel tired.

I linked your directly to the Kindle Store on amazon.com! I really do hope you consider getting your own =)
