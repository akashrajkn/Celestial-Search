Why does when you bid on an item on ebay?
that you put in a big bid and it only shows up as a dollar more? its shows a acual bid but then gives you a maximum bid? i dont get how it works

The maximum is so that ebay will automatically out bid someone for you if they try to bid higher, up to the max that you set. That is, what you're willing to spend on the item. It's so that you don't have to go back and keep raising the bid little by little and you don't have to worry about someone coming in at the last second and outbidding you by just a little bit.
easy 2 points
OK you have found an item you want, you place your maximum bid (the most you are prepared to pay) For example start price on the item is $10.00 you are prepared to pay $20.00, so you enter $20. If you are the first bidder, the price will still be $10 & you will be the current highest bidder. If no one else bids, the item will be yours for $10 + whatever the postage costs are.

Using the same example if someone else bids & they were to place a bid of say $15.00, they will be immediately outbid as ebay is bidding on your behalf (automatic or proxy bidding) Then the price will then be $15.50 ( 50 cents is the increment at this stage) If they bid again at $20.00 the same as you, you will still be the highest bidder as the earlier placed bid takes priority.(its a bit of a give away on your max bid when this happens as there wont be an increment ) Now this other bidder really wants the item as well, so they place another bid of $25.00. You will no longer be the highest bidder & provided no one else bids, they will win the bid for $20.50. 

BTW No one else knows your max bid just you.

The increment that I mentioned before ranges on the current price of the auction. It increases when the bidding goes over certain $ values. I think if bidding goes over $25 the increment is $1, then over $100 it increases again. 

I suggest you read ebays buying help for more info.
