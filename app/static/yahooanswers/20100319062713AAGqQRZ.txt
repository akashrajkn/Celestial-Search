I've been using Google Chrome- Does it have a stop button?
I'm using Google Chrome, cause Firefox 3.6 has too many issues and WHO KNOWS when they're gonna get around to fixing them ??
Anyway I've got the hang of the basics and have installed some add ons.
Is there a Stop button for GC ???
I can't believe that they didn't put it on as a standard part of their browser........
BTW: IE sucks (just like most Microsoft products) so don't say to use it. got out of that habit long ago.

Ummm.... yeah... top right there is a Red X. You click it to cancel stuff.
Hi,
Yes, off coarse there is.
It appears to the right of the address bar only when you are in the process of loading a page.

And yes, I agree. Firefox is a mess and IE is a holiday resort for hackers.
Google Chrome owns! :)

Good luck.
Just use Internet Explorer.  It's the best browser if you're on a Windows PC because it's built for Windows.  All of the other browsers aren't built for Windows specifically so they always have problems, whereas IE is always fixing and making their browser just that much better! :)
