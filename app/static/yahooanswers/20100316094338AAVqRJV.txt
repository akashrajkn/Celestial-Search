20mb Broadband :/ Really ? Help Please?
Well i have a 20mb broadband but when i go onto speedtest it only gives me a 6.8 mb download speed ?
Any Ideas Why/

20Mbps is the maximum raw line rate. It doesn't mean you'll actually download at 20Mbps.
6.8 was your average download speed. 20Mb mean it was the maximum but you will never get to that speed.
