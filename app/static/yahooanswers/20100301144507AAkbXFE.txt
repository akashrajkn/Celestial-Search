Is it ok for neighbor to use my wirelwess Internet connection?
I live at the beach.  My neighbor's sister has come down to stay in their condo for March.  They don't have the Internet and the sister asked if she could use my wireless connection.  I have no problem with her doing this, but I am wondering if she could get my personal information from sharing? How would I block her?

She couldn't get your personal information unless she was a damned experienced computer hacker.  Don't worry.
They can but thats only if the wanted to hack your router signal, if you trust them and they just want to use the internet for email and whatever I wouldnt worry and since you live at the beach away from people you wouldnt have to worry about anyone outside of the house (strangers) getting into your connection.
If she just using the internet for browsing E-mails or shopping then it's no problem. Just as long as she's purposely hacking your connection.
Well as long as the connection is unlimited why not ?
