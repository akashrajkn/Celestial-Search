Virus On My Computer!?
I have a virus on my computer that doesn't let me log in into any account.

So when I startup and log on to one of the user accounts, it logs me out right after.

And, to be worst, it disables my keyboard UNTIL i'm at the log in screen so I can't press F2 or such when the computer is starting up, any ideas?

I can't log on Guest or any account. The virus automatically logs me back out as I log back in. And I can't download anything because I can't LOG IN.

I'm using Windows XP. I've heard rumors of a certain Windows CD that can restart the computer as if it was brand new? Any ideas on where to get that?

Can you please support a step-by-step guide on any of your comments? Please and thank you!

Its not a rumors of the cd

its windows CD
 fomat the computer
you should have recieved the cd when your bought your computer.

if you don't have one, you could try to borrow a friends, or download it somewhere online and copy it to a cd.


or you could take your computer to geek squad or somewhere else and they might be able to get rid of the virus
if not a virus, it could just be an infinite boot loop that is in your start up folder that keeps logging u out. the whole disabling the keyboard thing though is sorta weird to me. there's sometimes a button on your computer close to the on/off switch that enables some control over the start up process of the computer.
