Where's the best place to sell DVDs online?
My dad wants me to sell two larger products for him on Ebay. He and I also have a few DVDs we want to sell. Is Ebay the best (or good enough) place? Or is there another site that's better to sell DVDs at? (I also have box seasons of TV shows.)

i sell a good chunk of my things on craigslist.org
You can also try Amazon marketplace
ebay and amazon they charge you fee, but craiglists.org if free, avoid scam do local only, do not accept wire xfers.
