Pretty urgent n important..much thanx! :D
Dot.tk isnt free :(

dot.tk
can't get a 'FREE' 'domain name'


you can get 'domain forwarders' like dot.tk though

just go and purchase one, there like 20$ a year.... I have 6 myself, heh

IDotz < great place to register domains
GoDaddy < another great place
Free Domain name is not useful one...You can get the source by seraching the Google or Yahoo.com..But the Domain Names looks like www.Domainname.freedomainname provider.com,for that i suggest you to purchase Your own Domain Name legally,,In the site 
http://www.goresellers.com/ You can get the Domain Name reseller account at low cost and host your site also register the Domain Name.
