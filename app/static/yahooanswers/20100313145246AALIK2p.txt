has anyone ever tried these work from home things?
like this one here http://gblackv3229.secureordertransaction.com/?aff=CD6 where you can earn 5000-7000 a month
all you have to do is pay 1.51 p & p

They are cons, they tell u to pay ?50/$100  and they will show theyre way of earning money.

Well il tell u how

They tell u to set a website up the same as theirs. And now you start earning money the same way
just look at the numbers and ask yourself does it sound real
if the were real everyone would be using them and everyone would be at home>that is why they are called scams
The vast majority are scams, be careful when trying these out especially if they ask you for money up front, you should not have to pay to work! really high earnings are usually another sign of a scam, if it sounds to good to be true then it usually is
Well, everyone works differently, but I work best by getting a book from the library, or a bookstore, or even borrowing one, reading it, and just trying it out on my own.

You can hire a tutor, use a book, online tutorials, ask others you know who are programmers to help, etc.
Why not have a website? See:

they train you for free, show you what to do.
I have been scouring the internet and talking to some of my best known business associates, and this is the best I have found.  There is a LOT of money in this system:

You get a money producing affiliate website, and you keep 100% commission.
The only thing is, you need to learn some SEO. You'll get some training to market it and everything. There is a Pro option that you can choose later on if you wish.
