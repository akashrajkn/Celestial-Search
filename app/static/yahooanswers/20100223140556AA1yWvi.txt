Rewards1 Is it real and....?
First of all is rewards1 real?
second, if you were to get enough points to get for (xbox) microsoft points will the card with the code come through the mail or the code will be given through the internet?

Yes.

The last one i don't know. Check their Forums.
It's real, in the sense that it's not an outright fraud. But are all it's claims true? Read the fine print!
