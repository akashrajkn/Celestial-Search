Hello Davis,

My name is Mr. Kobby Nkrumah, a banker here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith hoping that I will rely on you. In 2006, one  Mr. Daniel Davis, who has same surname as yours and who has your country in his file as his place of origin, made a fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, valued at $12,750,000.00. with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of Manager now. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 16th of January 2009. Unfortunately, he died in a Fiery plane crash at Madrid airport that killed 153 passengers on board. You can read of the event on the following site:

It seems legit.
It is, do not go with it,
Fake.
yeah srry but this is a scam they are giving u a lot of money just because it has your name, yeah i get a lot of emails like this a lot. people these days are trying to steal our money. also if this was really real they would have also sent it to u from a bank not skype account srry its a scam
Its 200% a scam, do not respond. First of all, banks in Ghana do not use $ so if there was money, they would tell you he had 12 million cedis, not dollars. Second, if you were the beneficiary the bank would have informed your country's embassy in Ghana, who would inform a lawyer in the US to contact you by registered mail, never email. its a scam to get you to reveal your bank account number and will keep asking you for various fees and taxes but there is no money. Google inheritance scam, people lose millions of dollars every year in these scams
