help cant log into aim?
well i tried to log in like right now but it's saying 'incorrect account or password''? i logged in this morning and everything was ok, but right now it wont let me, no one know's my password and stuff. also i tried to log into my aol email but it wouldn't let me also? any help as in why it's doing this

stop with all these AIM not working posts. Contact aol for this issue.
Many people are experiencing this problem, make sure your login info is correct, and if that doesnt work try using aim on the web like www.meebo.com until the problem is fixed, if that doesnt work just wait a day and try again tomorrow
make sure your Caps lock is off...or press on forgot email and request a new password
im going thru this too as i see many others are, i hope its up and running again soon
