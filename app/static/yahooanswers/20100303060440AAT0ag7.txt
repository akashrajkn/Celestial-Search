4. Profit ~

=D
What is that from? =s

It has it's origins in season 2 episode 17 of South Park, 'Underpants Gnomes'

In it, the character Tweek has his underpants stolen by gnomes, and when investigating why, they explain their process of getting profit from his underpants, which was:

Phase 1: Collect Underpants
Phase 2: ?
Phase 3: Profit

the humour being derived from nobody knowing the step between collecting the underpants and profit.

It was brought up as an internet meme probably by 4chan or 7chan
