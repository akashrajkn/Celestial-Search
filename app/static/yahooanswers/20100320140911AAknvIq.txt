What is your favorite web browser and why?
I'm looking for the fastest and most intuitive web browser available on my Mac.

Firefox Is the Best Ever It is The Fastest I Have Both Internet Explorer And Mozilla Firefox And Mozilla Is The Fastest
Google Chrome works lovely on a Mac. (I know from owning one.) Firefox is a bit overrated nowadays, I'm not going to explain why, due to my laziness. But I can tell you one thing, Firefox kills your ram. Google chrome doesn't.

kkthnxbai.
Firefox it's fast, reliable, and free. Also there are many themes and add-ons.
