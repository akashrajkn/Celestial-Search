Internet Explorer is a mess.Try Mozilla Firefox.Its the best.It is available in many languages.download the latest from the net but i prefer the Mozilla Firefox 3.5
good luck!
There are instructions on the Microsoft support site and via a google search on how to deal with this issue and to downgrade to IE 7.  Try using a different browser.  I use Google Chrome which is quick, simple to use and of course free.
Here you can find the instructions to uninstall Internet Explorer 8 and roll-back to Internet Explorer 7
