What are some good free Emo chat sites?
Hey my name is Susi and Ive been struggling to find a good Emo chat site. Please help!

Haha myspace has been taken over by emo and scene kids, try that.
Well...I don't know but Have you ever tried gothme.net I know It's not emo but there's nice pics. Also this website is definitely not emo but you could try Omegle.com it's a random site where they set you up with stranger it's kinda fun.
And I guess... Smeet.com
lol i dont think they made emo chat rooms
