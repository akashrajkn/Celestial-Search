Im looking for someone to write me a blog for my webpage, www.ryanmurphy.org.uk.
It can be about any subject you wish.
The length can be as long or as short as you wish. 
I will provide a link (backlink) to any site you wish and will give you full credit, I want more content and blogs. 
Can any help.
thanks Ryan

Hi Ryan,

It appears your attempting to outsource your content creation (yes, I have a grasp of the obvious) using barter. Exchange a link for content.

Smart, however, hard to get any takers since content creation takes effort.

I automate this with the use of a WP plugin.

I know a guy who's used it to garner a #3 position in the Google SERP for his keyword.

Granted, it takes much more than simply filling a blog to get #1 page ranking, but it certainly helps.
