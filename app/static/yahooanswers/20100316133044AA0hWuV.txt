formspring.me not working?
alright, i have a formspring.me and, this is gonna sound bad, but the only place i can get on it is school. they don't have the site blocked, and i check it when i'm at school. but i try to get on it at home on my laptop, && google pops up saying it doesn't exist? has this happened to anyone?
what's going on, and how do i change this?
thaaanks, (:

It's not registered with a domain service.

In other words it's on your school "Intranet." It's a private service that you can only access over your schools network.

If you really wanted to and had admin authority you could tunnel in with VPN but I doubt this will help you.
