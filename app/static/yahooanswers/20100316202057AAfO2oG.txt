Internet explorer screen too big?
I reformatted by computer and now my internet explorer is too big. My screen size is set at 100% and text size is at medium. It is only internet explorer. My desktop is not enlarged. Anyway to solve this? Thanks
When I use ctrl or minimize it, only the breadth changes and words becomes too small to read. The length is still the same and I have to keep scrolling down

I think you have the standard resolution which should be fine . 
otherwise you can try minimizing you screen resolution like 1024x768 or smthg like that .
hope this helps

Hold down the "Ctrl" key and then move the scroller on your mouse to adjust the size of the screen.
try changing the zoom level in your internet explorer
