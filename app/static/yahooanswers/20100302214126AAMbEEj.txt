why the maxthonbrowser is blocking?which browser is good?


Firefox or Chrome
I have evaluated chrome, the only thing chrome is good for is flashing routers.  it's perfect for that, but don't use it as a browser - it doesn't load 75% of sites I visit, and they are reputable.

apple safari is good and supports html 5.0 with more capabilities than other browsers
mozilla firefox is good but features break if you use plugins. doesn't always print well.
IE is insecure but a good browser, prints well.
Opera is fast, but doesn't use webkit like safari and firefox, and renders DHTML in a way that requires special handling (at least my display:block code didn't work).  actually, code that works on everything else doesn't work on opera.  headache for the DHTML coder.

I would say stick with firefox or safari to be safe.
