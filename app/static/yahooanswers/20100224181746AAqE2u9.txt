What internet browser fits this description?
I need a internet browser that:

Rarely ever crashes,
Is Pretty fast,
And is extremely reliable.

Any ideas?

Firefox, or Chrome
FIREFOX.
Firefox 3.6
Lynx

Mozilla Firefox
chrome then firefox if you don't have windows vista if you do there is none other than internet explorer
Mozilla's Firefox.
Firefox is all three of those things, except if you want a really fast browser get either Google Chrome or Opera (the new Opera 10.5 is in beta and it is the fastest but it has crashed on me a few times.) I also think that Opera is very full-featured. They are all pretty good, so I use all 3. Safari is pretty reliable but only on Mac.
Firefox:
