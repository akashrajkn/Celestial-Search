Have you signed up for lockerz yet?
Lockerz is a legit site where you can get free stuff. Just log in everyday, watch vids, answer questions and everytime you do, you get points. Get enough points and you get free stuff (ipods, comps, games,etc.) Theres no catch except that its invite only. So, If you want in on this free stuff, click on my user name and send me an email for an invite.

Lockerz is a scam.
