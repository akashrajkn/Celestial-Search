How do i get into a members only site, free?


It depends on the site. Obviously, if membership is expensive and you're able to download things from it, it's often impossible to obtain a free login.

However, you could try this site:

Bugmenot has a huge list of logins for sites that require you to sign up in order to gain access. It may not help, but it's the best chance you've got short of trawling through dozens of pirate sites hunting for lists of passwords that are generally wrong or out of date.
