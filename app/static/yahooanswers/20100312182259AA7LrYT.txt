If my landlord has Direct TV/AT&T can I get Time Warner Cable internet?
So basically, the house I'm renting a room in has DirecTV cable and AT&T for an internet service provider.  But, I want to get Time Warner Cable internet in my room.  Would this be at all possible? Thanks for any help!
What I mean is, is it possible to have the two companies working the same household? The landlord I know won't have a problem with the plan.

If your landlord says yes, you can.  Otherwise, you'll have to use a wireless internet.
Check your lease and ask the landlord. We can't give you more advice than that.

Hope that helps.
