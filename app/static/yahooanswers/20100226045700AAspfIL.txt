How is it possible to make money online as a job opposed to home based business.?
Just like a job. Here's a task that I need done. This is what I'll pay you to do it. People go to offices everyday of the week, and THEY sit at their desk in front of a computer and get paid a salary. Can I please have all the advice on this subject as physically possible. Thank you so much

There are no jobs as such in the online world, people make money with websites and blogs.
It takes some learning though.
There is some info and vids here:

it won't cost a penny.
Well, everyone works differently, but I work best by getting a book from the library, or a bookstore, or even borrowing one, reading it, and just trying it out on my own.

You can hire a tutor, use a book, online tutorials, ask others you know who are programmers to help, etc.
You could do affiliate work or write an ebook about something you know then sell it.
Here they make you a professional page for it http://computereweb.com/get-10-dollar-website it only costs $10
when you get going you can write more ebooks and keep on selling them, it's a good method.
ok, visit ** Money.spacepk.com ** to know about all the money making oppurtunites online, there are tons and tons of ways to make money online, but not all of them can be discussed here, so it would be better if you visit the site Money.spacepk.com and read it yourself...
You could write, I used to do that, or use GPTHQ - it's just like data entry, form filling type stuff but it's not too bad. They update it a lot, it's free - a few hours a day you'd probably get $90 odd.
You can open an auction site like clone2009 and get paid for advertisement. check the site out it worked for me.
Check out the forum at workplacelikehome they have great job leads for working at home.
I have tried so many different online money making programs, alot are rubbish, but I recently came accross http://onlineprotege.com , I am now making $100 a day, it has taken me a month to get to this point, I am working hard to improve on this. I seriously suggest you take a look, it works for me :)
I've been making money online for 3 years now and like the last person who answered, have tried a ton of programs and read a ton of books.

There are many different ways to make money at home but they all require a good bit of learning and also trial and error.

Life is about to make a choice. You can make money by working as employee or make monye from your online business.

Some people choose to become business person by utilize the internet. 
These people make money by:
1: Sell their own product
2: sell other people product
3: make money from advertising

The beauty of the online business is almost all of the process can be automated. With the right knowledge, ordinary people may have good passive income. These people does not have to go to the office. instead they can choose to stay with their loved ones and do whatever they please.
