ebay insertion fees help????? i really need helpppp!?
hi,
so recently, ebay has started a new policy where everything you list under $1 the insertion fee is nothing. It used to be that every first 5 listings the insertion fee is nothing. I think the the first five listings one is more effective because you pay less money. I am freaking out due to the fact that now i have to pay more fees! Anyone else have the same problem???!

also, anyone here know the email address to the ebay team? I really want to contact them about this situation! I looked all over ebay and cant find a thing! Please help! Thanks guys.

please real answers only and i will pick the best answer! ( :

Also,I'm just a small seller, so they don't give me their number. I've seen phone numbers for them, and none seem to work. The alternative is to use

Good luck!
