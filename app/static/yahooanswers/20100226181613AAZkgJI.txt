What is the fastest internet browser?


I recommend you to use Avant Browser than Mozilla Firefox.
I recommend using safari. VERY fast browser, and works on windows, or mac.
i heard that safari is the fastest
Google Chrome.
Yeah, Google Chrome is extremely fast. actually, it's unbelievably fast.
I would recommend FireFox.  I have never had any major issues with it and it's very quick as opposed to IE.  I've used Chrome and I was instantly turned off by the layout and thought it was a little too choppy but I have friends that prefer Chrome so to each is own.
