Really embarrassing computer/ internet question?
If I purchase a wireless computer for traveling, how will I be able to get onto the Internet and do e-mail?  I am a senior who uses the library computer which already is connected.

If the computer that you are purchasing was made in the last five years it will have a "wireless adaptor". This is a device that is inside of the machine and allows it to connect to the internet via wireless connections. The only thing you would have to do is go somewhere that is a wireless "hotspot"....such as Starbucks, airports, hotel lobbies ect.
You will have to find a HOTSPOT where Wifi Access is provided.

Places like Cafe's Hotels. Airports and some Rail stations all provide access. Some is free and some you have to pay.
You can buy a wifi router, but you would only get wireless internet in that house or area. Or you can buy a 3G stick for T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon. It is a USB stick, so you plug it into your computer and you will get internet anywhere, ex: car, train, plane, park, anywhere. The first option is free. The second option costs approximately $60 a month.
Most laptops now have wifi built in it's just a matter of finding a suitable hotspot and connecting. Many countries have either free access points or do a pay as you go wifi service,you just buy some credit, connect to their service and enter the pin number. I get few problems around the world trying to get internet and  get at least 60% free!
As others have mentioned, you could use WiFi to connect to a wireless network for Internet access. WiFi is free.

If you wanted to have Internet access anywhere, however, you would have to subscribe to a 3G/4G provider, which is a service you must pay a monthly fee for.
