i ordered something on amazon.com and i looked at the tracking info and it says its delivered but it not here?
About a month ago I started using amazon.com I bought a few things before and they got here okay, so about a week ago I bought a 360 headset every now and then I would look at the tracking information and it says its was delivered yesterday but I don't see it at my door step does this mean its missing or should it be here soon

Delivered means delivered.

If the UPS or Fed Ex tracking system says it was delivered and you do not have it, you need to contact them directly and find out where it is.  If they left it on your door step, it may have been stolen.  Most likely though it is waiting at the closest shipping center.
