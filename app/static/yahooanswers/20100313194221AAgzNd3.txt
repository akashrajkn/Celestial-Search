I'm confused with what you want.
build up a character, create something very significant, once youve gained popularity from that piece, create lots of mediocre art, people will be like Ohhh So and So has smeared shit on his canvas, how emotional.
really the main thing is to have some unique or amazing art style.
but if, like me, you don't have that then one thing people have mentioned before is to look at a lot of other people's work and give faves for work you like - if you fave someone, or comment on their work, they're more likely to look at your page and thus you're more likely to get your work noticed.
