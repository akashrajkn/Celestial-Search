Whenever I use my internet explore every time I try to go to a link page it just keeps running?
Whenever I use my internet explore every time I try to go to a link page it just keeps runniong but gioing nowhere .  All I get is the little turning halo showing that it is trying to connect but nothing happens. there is no web address in the tool bar at the top left of the page what is happening & how do i correct this. any ideas would be much appreciated.

internet explorer is a WWWPB   (world wide web page browser) a lot of people use it but they don't know that it's actually VERY LAGGY, SLOW, INSUFFICIENT, AND VIRUSES CAN EASILY GET IN WITHOUT WARNING!!! try Firefox or Google Chrome they run much faster and take up less room =D.

if you still want to keep internet explore then... umm.. try refreshing the page or delete your history and cookies to loosen up the room in there... don't open too many tabs or windows with internet explorer cause then, IT WILL CRASH believe me!!
Be sure you are able to provide the connection. Your computer read what you wanted, but cant find it. Open up the channels. provide, or allow the link to close, or connect.
 I would think the term "hung up on something " is a good clue
