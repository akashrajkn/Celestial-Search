I just downloaded a torrent....After downloading it now it says that it is seeding..What does that mean?
The torrent just finished up and i figured that it would read.....download complete but now it is seeding it .

You are uploading the stolen what ever back to other thieves!
It means you finished downloading it, and you have 100% of the file(s), and are uploading it to others in the swarm. This is normal. You should seed till  you reach a ratio of 1.0 or better. That means you've given back at least as much as you've taken.
seeding means that other people are getting information from you
John said it well!
and  John c why do u think she is stealing stuff?!!! torrents are used for other things u know!
torrents will die if they dont get seeded, so its a good thing u r doing it!
