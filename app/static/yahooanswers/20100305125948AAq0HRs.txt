what has happened to icefilms.info?
the ice films website seems to not be there anymore, anyone know why?? or where it's gone?

apparently they're selling the site. now its Parallel's Plesk Panel.
Last week they were talking about moving to another server, so I'm assuming they're in the process of doing that.  It looks like according to their Twitter page, they're moving to http://www.icefilmstube.com.  Apparently the switch is still in process.  Hope this helps.
doesn't work. you can watch free movies at http://livefilmsonline.info 1100+ movies online.
I tried the alternatives suggested but you need to fill out surveys that are NOT free since they ask for credit card # or cell phone #.. these are not replacements for icefilms.. they are scams..
I'm still hoping it will come back..
