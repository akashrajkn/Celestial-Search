Which internet browser do you use and would you consider switching to another browser,if so which one?
I use Firefox and I wouldn't switch to another b/c I've already tried IE and Google Chrome and the 1 I have now works smoothly 4 me:)

I use IE8.  I don't mind Firefox.  Chrome is alright, but my preference is for IE8
opera web browser works fine too.. you can try portable opera and see for your self =)
I use Firefox too. I hate IE, there is so many security flaws with it, I don't know why people still use it. I have Chrome installed too, but it's very glitchy for me. I think once they get a lot of things fixed with it, I may switch over to that one. Firefox is definetley the best right now, if you ask me.
