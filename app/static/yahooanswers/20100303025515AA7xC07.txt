How has the internet changed the way teenagers communicate?
In what ways through the internet?

Wow, a LOT of internet communications are MSN, e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, chatrooms, LOTS. 

Well some people say that the teens have no 'human touch'. What they mean is that we should use the phone and chat through the phone, not the internet. Also they say it's bad for our eyes. Very bad.
Using yahoo msn messanger and as well as facebook.
