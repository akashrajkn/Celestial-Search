I can't seem to access winglin anymore!!?
for the past few weeks, I've been trying to access winglin. But Internet explorer or Mozilla says it can't find the wab page! What's wrong~? Is there something wrong with winglin or is there something wrong with my laptop?

nothing is wrong with ur laptop
I cant access winglin either.No one can.
I dont know what happened,but i hope it will be back up soon...
I want winglin back,plrasessssssssssssssss.
It's probably under maintenance. 
No one can reach Winglin right now.
Either the guy who made it died (which is very... sad. but is almost impossible to happen)
Or he's late with some fees for the site.
Or they're updating some whole new look.
T__T
i can't update my story, nor can I read anyone else's. 
PLEASE COME BACK TO LIFE WINGLIN.
IT'S BACK UP AND WORKING NOW! :D:D:D:D
