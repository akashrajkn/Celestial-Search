Cute little hearts on picnik?
ok so i use picnik to edit my pictures, it does a pretty good job for a sort of free photo editing site.  so my friend edits her pictures and she always has this heart on there and i think its really cute but i cant seem to find it on picnik, and i know for a fact that she doesnt have premium, but i cant seem to find the heart anywhere on the site. it looks like a "hand drawn" heart but its not under that section, thats premium though so she couldnt have gotten it there, and it it kind of on an angle, just slightly. I've been looking everywhere for it on the site, and im quite possitive that she doesnt use any other editing site. thanx!

in Picnik, use create mode, text and using King cool kc, and for heart press Shift and 6 at the same time :]
