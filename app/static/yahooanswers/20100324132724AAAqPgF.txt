Has Richard Dawkins.net forums gone down again? (forum members and those with experience on it, please)?
Hi, I am trying to get onto the richard dawkins.net forums, it's fine until I click on the link on Google and then the page goes blank, it doesn't load anything, yesterday it didn't let me post or quote anything. So has the forums gone down again?

I'm having the same trouble! The admin need to at least get a notice up on the front page to let people know.
