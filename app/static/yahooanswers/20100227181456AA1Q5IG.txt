firefox if i private browse can my neighbor see my history if im connected to her internet?


Yes they can, and probably do.  Don't be surprised if you get arrested for stealing internet!
History is stored on your computer. So unless she hacks your PC or runs a network monitor while your online, you should be safe.

She can easily see that you are using her internet however, just not what your using it for

(Don't be afraid of the term "network monitor" it is an advanced program that deals with ip addresses and packets. Super advanced stuff)
if it is going through her firewall or router, obviously she can monitor if she want to.
