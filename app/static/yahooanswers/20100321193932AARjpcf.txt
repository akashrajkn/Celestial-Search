Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, or Hotmail?


just get it in the crack of the ass
I would just get an account on each & see how you like them.   Definitely not Hotmail.   My personal opinion... you'll like Gmail the best.  It's easily now the most popular and has the most nice features.
Depends on what you what Hotmail has alot of features including IM, Yahoo! is almost like hotmail but sometimes puts adware on your computer, and gmail has the best spam detector.
Gmail don't ask you to pay to get some of the features Yahoo and Hotmail do (like POP, forwarding and IMAP) so they're always going to be a better choice for features.
Yahoo! Mail...

easy to use...easy to organize...easy to search through... easy to attach and send tons of stuff... no limit on inbox and outbox size... this is an email all about you...personal...awesome...
I have all three,I use one for business,one for newsletters,and one for socializing. They are all free so why not open an account for each and see what you want to do..
well I like their answers sight but Yahoo is sucky when it come to doing email I have never used hotmail so I don't know I would say Gmail.
All 3
