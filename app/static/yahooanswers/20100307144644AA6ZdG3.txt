Does anyone know of any sites where I can buy cigarettes and not have to pay the taxes at the end of the year?
I'm from New York, and the price of cigarettes is up to 10 dollars around me, and I refuse to pay that much. I've seen some sites online that have cartons for 50 bucks, but I've heard that with sites like that, they somehow screw you and make you pay the extra money...I dunno. Is this true? Are these sites trust worthy? Can anyone recommend any no-strings-attached sites?

If you think your cigs are expensive, try living in Canada... $13 du maurier...Try going on vacation :P, when I was in the Dominican Republic, it was $3 for a pack of Maralboro.. and $25 packs for a carton of smokes.
No.  You are legally required to pay your state's sales tax on cigarettes.  You can do so at the time of purchase, or at the end of the year (if you use those websites).  You could just buy from those websites and hope they don't find you, I guess, but there is no other legal solution.
i live in washington state and here many people who smoke a lot go to indian reservations and buy their smokes because they don't charge tax on smokes there!! i am not shure of the price because i don't smoke!! i am shure it must be a lot lower or people wouldn't be going there??
Just QUIT smoking is BAD for you & others around you do you want cancer so QUIT.
