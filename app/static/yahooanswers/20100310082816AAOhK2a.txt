What is the best proxy website?
I need a website that will let me log into MySpace and send messages. All of the ones that I've found will not send messages. Preferable one with the least amount of pop-up. The website link cannot have the name MySpace, FaceBook, Or Gaia in it. If It does it won't work. And PLEASE free. I'm poor. >.< It's really important. If you wanna know the reason send me an e-mail. =D I like to share happy stories. Thanks!

As per my opinion don't go for proxy server site.....

use u992 tool it'll find proxy server automaticaly and it'll give you good speed and it's very little application... and you don't want to install it also and big thing is that it's free....

I hope it would be helpfully for you
I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn's over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn't support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com.  He's kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it's been working all the time. I haven't been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it's supposed to. Once connected you don't even know it's there. It's not free but it works perfectly.
This proxy works with myspace and youtube videos! check it out
