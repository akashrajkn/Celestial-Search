How to play online with a friend?
I want to find a good site that has the ability to play online with a friend (along with friend).
I want the same as Windows Live Messenger, but in site.
Please, do not want something that is paid or who has to install something on your computer.

There's quite a few actually. Some of the most popular are listed below.
