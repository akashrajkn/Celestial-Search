why do certain web pages not load?
i am trying to do my joshua's law on the internet but for some reason internet explorer or Firefox wont load the page. There are a few others that also wont load.

What website did you take the course on? Sometimes this could be a flash issue and you need to either download or upgrade your Adobe flash. The customer support reps should be able to walk you through whatever issue it is.
