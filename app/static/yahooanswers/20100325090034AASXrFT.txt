What do you look for most in a clan website?
I am currently constructing a clan site. What is the most important thing you look for in a clan site? Is it pics,videos, forums, how active the admins are, usability of the site, visuals, platform of gaming?

I don't use clan sites!
forums/someway to talk to ur members is quite important

definitely member pages and way to talk to them like email or sumthing is good, plus idk what game its for but i always am interested in my stats so maybe a link to each members stats or something to that extent on their page would be good too
