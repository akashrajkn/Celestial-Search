I cant send mail from my alternative address to any Yahoo address?
I recently registered a new Yahoo mail address (r.crusoe14@yahoo.com) and am unable to sent any mail fromm my alternative address (crusoe@telkomsa.net) I get a mail demon answer that it is blocked,

Need more info are you sending from telkomsa.net to yahoo mail?

Oh and you shoild never put you email address out there in the form that you did.  This r.crusoe14@yahoo.com should be rdotcrusoe14atyahoodotcom it will help keep the spammers at bay.
