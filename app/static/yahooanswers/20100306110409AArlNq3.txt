How long does it take for play.com to deliver?
I ordered a graphics card for my computer off play.com on Tuesday and it still hasnt come, I was wondering how long it will take 

( I also ordered Battlefield 2 and that came on friday but I dont see why they couldnt deliver them at the same time, they were both arounf ?40 )

its normaly 7 to 5 days but not all products come from play some come from different shops or stores and it depends on whos delivering it :)
