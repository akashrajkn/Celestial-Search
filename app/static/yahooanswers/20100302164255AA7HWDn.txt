Photoediting so they're on top of each other..?
What photo editing site can I use to edit my pictures so that they're on top of each other? Like, I want it to be one picture, but two pictures are combined, and one's on top while the other's on bottom?  

 Lol, I hope that makes sense. Thanks. (:

I don't know of a site... but "coral draw" does blend pictures to make them both the same pic. It has a way to rid or minimize the background (makes background colors non-opaque or less opaque). You can also make the pic look "double exposed." this is like adding a ghost picture into your pic. Search "coral draw" on the internet.
You can edit your photos online, since there are so many websites for photo enhacment, and they are free. The best one is

Hope it can help.
