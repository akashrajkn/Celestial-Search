only the pay services like those offered by Apple, etc where you subscribe and are charged for each song or file downloaded - the free ones like Limewire and others are Loaded with viruses, trojans, and such, and will infect your PC in a heartbeat.
Well Limewire would probably be the safest and it is by far safe. I quit using all these p2p because I got tired of having to restore windows. The only thing you can use with out any problems is buy programs like itunes.
