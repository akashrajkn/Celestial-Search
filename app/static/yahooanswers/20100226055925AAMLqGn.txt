I cant log on to the internet with firefox anymore but I can with internet Explorer?
I had to use internet explorer to ask this question. I try to log on to Mozilla Firefox and I get a message that says " The operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Contact your system administrator ". This problem just started. I have to re download Firefox every time I want to use it. THanks

Maybe there is a firewall not allowing Mozilla Firefox to work. And if there is no firewall, then your internet connection got problems. Try to call the computer technician.
Well if you are at a shared computer its possible that the owner of the computer could've setted restrictions on that particular computer in that case you are going to have to talk to the adminstrator
Try 
Start > Default Programs > Set Your Default Programs
and make sure Firefox is set as your default browser.

EDIT

Bit of reading for you if the above doesn't work.

Check the firewall settings
