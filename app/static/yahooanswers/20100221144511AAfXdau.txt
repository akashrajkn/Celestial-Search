I never get replies back from twitter.?
After i text "GO" to setup my phone on twitter i dont get a reply back. i recently got my number changed but its the same carrier. is there something else i can do.? how do i fix this.?

hey dont worry i have done twitter for ages and i have only ever recived one tweet! i think the people who get tweets tends to be close friends or celebs so dont worry!
