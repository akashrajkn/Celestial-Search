What is the site where you can type the tune of a song?
I remember a few years ago discovering this website, but to this day I can't find it. 
basically all you would do is press any keys on your keyboard in time to a some rhythm you couldn't remember the name of, and it would give you a list of suggestions of what it could be. 
Anyone know of it?

I've never heard of that website, personally, but if you have an iPhone (or iTouch with a microphone attatchment) you can download the app called Shazaam! It basically does the same thing, only you hum the melody and rhythum.
well i'm not for sure what your talking about... what i do if i don't know the lyrics to a song or something i just type in parts of the song and it usually comes up for me.......hope i helped!!
