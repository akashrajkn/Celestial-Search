Is this a good idea.?
Would it be cool if i made a blog about fashion and beauty?
I thing it would be fun because i absolutely love cosmetology.  
Do you think people would really look at it?
It would also have like cool outfits and hair inspired by famous people..  :] 

it would be really cool for cute fashion ideas.

Yes , I always suggest you ,,.,, Thought there are log of sites for beauty and fashion, its always worth to share personal tips and cares with blogs... People will love it.. No doubt... Keep rocking,
I say do it.  As long as you write article that people might find via a search engine and you are also active on other fashion and beauty blogs and sites, you have a better chance of people wanting to check out your blog.  There are millions of blogs (~113 billion)  so don't expect thousands of hit right away.  Like everything else, you have to start somewhere.
Yes I love that too! that is want my blog is mostly about!

Maybe we could work together :) haha
