What webhosts is best to upload to gain points for a free premium account?
I don't have any use for another premium megaupload account, I have a life-time account there. Also, I wanted to try to upload files on rapidshare to get some points but then I saw that rapidshare is evil and requires you to buy an account before trying to obtain points... So lets see with hotfile, netload, depositfiles, or other hosts have to offer? Thanks

YOUTUBE,YAHOO,METACAFE,ETC
