Keyboared Typing Virus?
Ill just be typing and suddenly my screen will freeze, and then like 5 letters will pop up. It looks like this... "So hows it goooooooooooooooo" and then when I go to backspace it, it freezes and then deletes the whole sentence. I didn't have this problem until yesterday. I didn't change any settings or anything with my computer.

Could this be a virus?

(Also I changed my keyboards batteries like 3 times, and it hasn't helped)

Please help me people!

well, its not nessicerily a virus, in my experience with windows this happens perodicly, if you leave your computer on a lot i reccomend you restart it, if that dosent work, if you eat by your keyboard it could just be crap between the keys, so then you need to clean it
that happens to me. your computer is just being a little slow sometimes. when it freezes don't type or backspace because its taking the computer a little while to process it, so when it unfreezes it sends all your commands at once.  just restart the computer or something or just wait for a few seconds
