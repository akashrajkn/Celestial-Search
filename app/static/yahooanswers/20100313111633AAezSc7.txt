Lockerz Redemption When March?
Lockerz.com  When is the prize redemption this month? message me for a refferal
So if i want to redeem something i have to pay 100 points then i have to pay the price of the thing to get it. I think i'll use my points up then not bother with it.

I was wonderin the same thing, too!!!!!!!!!
march 25
It's going to happen near the end march at a random time Hope this helps
around march 26-30

They choose a random times for the redemption's I suggest you to use LockerzAlerts - http://www.lockerzalerts.com  service , they will send you text message to your mobile phone when the redemption occurs ! its also FREE !
All they said was
1. after March 24th; the date will not be announced beforehand
2. you have to buy chances (100 ptz for 1, 250 pts for 2, 350 for 3)
3. only the winning team, either the USA or the rest of the world, will be allowed to redeem this month. (and international is in the lead right now)
