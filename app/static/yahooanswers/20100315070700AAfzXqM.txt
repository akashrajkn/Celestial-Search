what is the best and most active forum for job seekers?
one where job seekers can discuss with others applying to the same companies, ect about the application and hiring process? I've tried the forums on indeed.com and dont really find it useful. thanks!

Never known an actual job discussion forum.  If you are looking for jobs, most relevant websites carry lists of jobs with job descriptions.  There is no "discussion" facility
You won't find any useful discussion forums and, more and more, you won't find any useful job fairs (they're turning into places that companies use to advertise their "we'll show you how to find a job if you pay us, no guarantee, though" products).  Post resumes on Monster, careers.com and places like that, network (if the company that a friend works for suddenly has an opening, you'll be among the first to know), knock on doors asking if there are any openings in what you do, etc.  Sitting at the computer almost never results in a job.  (Thousands of people apply for every opening on job boards - only one gets the job.  But posting is free, so post.)
