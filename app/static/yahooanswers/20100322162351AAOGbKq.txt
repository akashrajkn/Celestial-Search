Find an online library?
Is there a website I can go to that is just like a library? I sign up, maybe pay a shipping fee (I would prefer it to be free but I know I probably can't get away with that), and order books that can be sent to my home? Then, of course, I send them back when they are do. 

I was just wondering if there was anything like this?

I don't know of a site like that.

I do know that sometimes people treat Amazon.com like that, though. You can buy a book, read it, and sell it again as 'used' after you're done with it. You can keep the book as long as you'd like, and you can sell it for however much you want. There's no subscription fee or anything.

You can also buy a bunch of other things at Amazon, too.
