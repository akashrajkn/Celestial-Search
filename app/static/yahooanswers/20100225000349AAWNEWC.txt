internet browser question?
my internet browser history states sites visited i am not aware i have been on. if they are there is that a 100% deffinate answer that that particular site has been visited ?

Do you share your computer with anyone else? That would be the first question to ask.

If yes find out when the sites are visited by using the history bar, and then find out who was on at that time.

If not then it may just be ad sites that have been popping up on sites you have visited.

Hope that helped.
Maybe someone just use your computer.
if a website shows up in the history than its obvious it was visited
