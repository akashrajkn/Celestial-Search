which internet is the best?
my brother's birthday is coming up and i want to get him one.

By internet i'm assuming your talking about ISPs. I would recommend comcast. I have had great results with them.
Get the internets that are free.
It really depends on whats available in your area, based on whats available in my area, Roadrunner (Time Warner Cable) internet is the best.
