ebay?????????????????????
i ordered a dvd lot from ebay on saturday night and i paid for it and i still havent gotten any confirmation from ebay that it got shipped is it possible it got shipped but ebay just didnt get the info that it got shipped yet? i sent the guy a  email if he could tell me if it was shipped but no reply yet? wat should i do?
just to add this seller has perfect feedback and tons of it

What should you do?  Wait.
Not all sellers send emails to let you know its been shipped. Is the box icon next to the dvds lit up? this indicates the item has been posted to (not all sellers use that function either) What is the sellers handling time?
I wouldnt worry about it yet,  if you dont receive it in 2 or so weeks open a item not received dispute.
