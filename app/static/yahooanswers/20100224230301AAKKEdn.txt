What are some of my options for a good VPN Program?
I am currently looking for a good VPN program to hide my IP and provide me with a good way to anonymize myself. I recently found this VPN and I am considering buying it. http://www.hidemyass.com/vpn/ Is the best VPN or is there a better one out there?

I use this one, http://www.surfbouncer.com  It's been very reliable, fast and they have servers all over the world as well as high encryption options. Also check out this article on their site about being anonymous on the net. http://www.surfbouncer.com/personal_vpn_faq.htm   I found it quite interesting.
