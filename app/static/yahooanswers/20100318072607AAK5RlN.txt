Porn pops up randomly on my firefox?
I'm old enough to look at porn, but it's on my dad's computer, and I know my dad thinks it's inappropriate and everything because of the way he was raised and all that, and it's uncomfortable discussing the topic with him because of the way he is. Anyways,  All of a sudden, I had a porn site randomly pop up on my internet just one time, but I don't know when it will happen again. I have recently gotten spyware that didn't cause porn to pop up, and cleaned it up, but now I got this random porn pop up. How do I get rid of it. I've always cleared all of the private data and history in Firefox, and do that every time, but this is the first time, I'm having this problem. What are some programs I can download to remove the pop ups if it were to happen again? Will switching web browsers work and un installing firefox? like switching from Firefox to Google Chrome, or am I still at risk for more pop ups? Any information will be helpful.

Yea, random. That's it.
hello since your running firefox itss a easy fix go to firefox adon page download the adblock plus then restart your computer you will be popup free then check out all the many add ons for the cooliest beowser link https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=ADBLOCK+PLUS&cat=all&advancedsearch=1&as=1&appid=1&lver=3.6&atype=0&pp=20&pid=5&sort=&lup=
Download google chrome and surf porn in an incognito window.  That doesn't save any browsing history or cache anything.
I had the same issue than you just a few days ago.
A friend of mine recommended me to do an online scan on http://www.online-spyware-removal.com

It is actually better to scan your computer with an online scanner, because the spyware or adware can not manipulate the scan engine.

Please let me know if you need more help, will be happy to reply to you :)
