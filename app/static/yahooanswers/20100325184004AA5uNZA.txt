Is this website legit?
The name of it is http://sellmythingz.com - I can't tell if I should feel safe using it or not.

Yes, it's a legit site, the certificate is real and it registered on godaddy.com so I'd say go for it if you want to try the site out.
Judging by the crummy design of the website I'd say it's not legit. Stick with Ebay and Craigslist.
