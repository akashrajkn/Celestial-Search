My internet keeps disconnecting and i checked all the wires could it be the converter box?
I have time warner caple and road runner internet. we've had the box for a few years and had the problem for about a year but nobody seems to want to do shit about it... Any ideas?

It could be your modem, it could also be that you are out of their range for high speed internet, they neglect to tell you that until you start having problems.
If there was a power surge you may have shorted out the span of connection
mine just started doing that, it is a serious pain in the...  earlier I had some rodent eating my cables outside.  You must get them to look into it, it will not get better, and you are paying for that.  what I did was tell them they would pay me back for all of the cable I paid since I first stopped getting good service, and told them about it!  they got out there real quick, I got a refund but not the whole thing.  I am on the third time around.  but at least they know I am serious, and that it really is not me being a pain (I did not drop my soda on the router or something).
