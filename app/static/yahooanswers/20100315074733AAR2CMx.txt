this is worth a try go to the hosts file.
C:\Windows\System32|Drivers\etc

and do a search or any of those site's  

(ie..search > rsbots.net
If anything relates to that site it will show up, then you can just delete them...

This happens to me a few times, when i can't access a site, even when i know the site is ligit
Try opening up the web site on a different computer then downloading the program on that computer, then saving the file to a USB and returning to your computer and installing it. Seeing as you've had virus's on your computer it could be possible that a virus has infected one of your system framework files causing you to not be able to access some things online.

Since you need this download right away I would download it on a friends computer and save the file to a USB and then later you can worry about why your computer isn't working right.
