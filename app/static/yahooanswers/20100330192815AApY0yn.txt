Where can I download...?
Where can I download Digimon Season 3?
Ya know, the one with Renamon and Terriermon
I don't want to have to join a site or pay anything :) I just want to download the whole season ;)

get utorrent and go to .org. watch what you download though

if you know what your downloading it is just fine to go to thepiratebay
DO NOT GO TO PIRATEBAY! I REPEAT DO NOT. You sir, are an idiot, and if you use piratebay, I would like to inform you that you possibly have thousands of viruses. PirateBay has already been shut down by the federal government, and every torrent is linked to a virus, and you will most likely get hi-jacked. Use uTorrent, but use a safe website, such as http://www.h33t.com or http://www.demonoid.com.
