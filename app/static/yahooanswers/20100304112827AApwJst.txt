www.what a good name for a website.com
I think your user name would be a pretty good and memorable name for a website.
Really depends on what you plan to use the website for. 

Whenever you are naming a website you have to remember the main way people are going to find it is through its name. if say you are building a blog about your cats you wouldn't call it 'mychickenblog.com'

If you are planing on selling something with the website then your domain name is the most important thing you must take into consideration. The websites name will be your best option for search engines to find your website so its best to try and get at least one of your keywords or main product names into the website domain. for example if your are selling apple cider from your uncle Bobs Apple Tree distillery something like www.unclebobs-appletree.com would be a good choice.
really depends on the website !
