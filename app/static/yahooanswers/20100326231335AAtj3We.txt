How do I send video files over 30MB via email?
Is there a website that allows you to host them for free other than youtube, something more exclusive and personal that you don't have to be a member of to view the videos? Or is there a program that will make the files smaller so I don't have to split the video up? I tried converting it to something else but it's still too big to send through email and it's only 7 minutes long.

Here's a way to share your large (video) files with your friends:

It's easy, use this simple to use program called  HJSplit.

Split your video file into easily managed chunks,  
for example, split it into chunks of about 10MB each or 20MB each,  then you may
email these smaller chunks in separate emails to your friend.

Invite your friend to download HJSplit to recombine them together.

The download link for HJSplit:

OR:

As an alternate option, you may install the ZumoDrive software, 
ZumoDrive allows you to upload and share (the links) your files with others.

( The recipient does not need to have ZumoDrive installed to receive your files.)

As an alternative, you may use Rapidshare instead, 
but, Rapidshare is not free in the premium version.

Upload your file to Rapishare. Send the link that Rapidshare gives you to your friends. Now they can easily download the file. You do not need to be a premium user to upload files onto or download from Radipshare.
