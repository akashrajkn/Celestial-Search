Why does it says "Well, that was embarrassing" on Mozilla Firefox?
It might not be word for word but it's about the same. I turned it on and it said "Well, that was embarrassing" and told me to try again. I refreshed the page and it was normal again. 

Is this a virus? Or simply a joke?

Joke built into Firefox.
i do not use firefox but it sounds like a virus.
Just there version of the page not loading correctly.  So joke.

Better than:

THE PAGE COULD NOT BE DISPLAYED.  AND MIDGETS ROAM THE LAND.
It's an automatic message that pops up when Firefox has an error that it can't solve. Nothing serious like a virus.

There's information regarding it here http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_crashes
its a joke. it just crashed when u opened it.
Its just a Joke...

in my case firefox just crashes... and i get that "well this is embarrassing" thing...

i crash about 5 times on average a day and its really irksome

any idea why?

the previous built was more stable IMO...
No, it is not a virus.
And it doesn't just say "Well that was embarrasing," read the full info next time.
probably an easy joke
