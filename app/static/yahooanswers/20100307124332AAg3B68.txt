does israel have a lot of internet outages? (ie: a day or two with no internet)?
is this normal? if so, why does it happen so frequently

Not really I doubt it its more then 1 day but thats for Israeli areas, the story is different for the occupied land where there is no internet but if there is it is very slow. I mean Israel is blessed from the west with technology so internet should be fast but that land will be ours today or tomorow at any cost.
