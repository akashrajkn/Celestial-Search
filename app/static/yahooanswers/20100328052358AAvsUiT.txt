Internet Explorer address bar won't give me lists of sites anymore unless I put the whole address?
I just want to put in a word and for  a search and get a list of sites like I used to.

And before you all start - I KNOW it's antiquated, I don't want to change it though and there's no need to be nasty to me....please just be kind and help? 

Thanks.

I had the exact same problem, uninstall it. shut down your computer and and then download and install all over again.

that worked for me and hopefully it will work for you :)
