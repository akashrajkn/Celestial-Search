I have a prepaid visa card can I use it to buy things on ebay?
its an only 1 gift card prepaid visa.... can I use it to buy things off ebay?

Of course you can.  As long as you don't spend more than the balance on the card.
chances are if its VISA you shouldnt have a problem. all visa cards whether it be a credit or debit card work so long as there is money in the account and the associated numbers on the card and a CCV number (3 digit security number) are present. hope that helps
yes :D i've done it lots of times
