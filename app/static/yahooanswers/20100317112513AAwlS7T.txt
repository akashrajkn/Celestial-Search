what ever happened to AOL?
I remember when AOL was HUGE, everyone I knew had it and would talk about all the time ("what version do you have? we just upgraded to 3.0" etc) I remember the commercials were all over t.v. and having anything else was "lame" (I was in high school). Last I heard they merged with Time Warner Cable... and poof.... I don't even know if they exist anymore. How can in internet provider go from being #1 to nonexistent in only a few years? 2004 was the last time I heard anything about them?

It died out because it was terrible.
AOL is fine and well. I use it all time. I have had AOL for 14 years. I started with 1.5 now I have 9.5
I have all 7 screen names, and use them every day. AOL is a lot better than some of the other complicated crap. I can go on all 7 of my screen names a the same time on 7 different computers.
I think it is well worth the cost. I also have 3 yahoo e-mail accounts, 1 gmail, 1 ATT.net, 3 facebook accounts, and one my space account.
AOL has since been spun off from Time Warner effective a few months ago and is run imdependently. Over the years it has gradually lost a lot of its client base and its decision to discontinue support of the Netscape web browser a few years ago hasn't helped matters.

They also split its internet access and advertising business in 2008 and it was suggested at that time that they may selloff the internet access divison at a later time.

Although it is still around along with its products such as AOL Mail, AIM messenger, etc,  competition is fierce and AOL are clearly losing the ISP war.
AOL is alive and well! They split with Time Warner about a month or so ago. I've had AOL for about 4 years now. I have the 9.0 VR and it is very good. AOL is a very good internet provider and has many good features. Good security features, spam filter and browsing.
