Is ebay Safe to buy from?
I have seen somethings on ebay which i have not found anywhere else. I want to buy this mans hairband like the ones you see Fernando Torres wear etc but cant seem to find them them anywhere and indian necklace with an om sign. If you know another website please paste otherwise is ebay safe for me to buy items such as these, its just that i have only started buying off the internet because i know some people who have bad experiences with internet buying.
thanks

Ebay is generally good for buying online. Generally sellers are more wary of buyers, especially if you have less than 10 points feedback. If you were to buy from them, it's best to check their feedback first to see how others have found their buying experience with that particular buyer. Usually those who have feedback more than 95-100% are the ones to trust.

If you are unfortunate enough to have a bad experience, paypal and ebay are usually really good support wise and will try their best to get you your money back, especially paypal. Good luck!
