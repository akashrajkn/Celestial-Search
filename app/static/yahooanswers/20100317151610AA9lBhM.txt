Just reinstall your old OS. Or install a Linux-based OS.
From your previous question it sounds like someone is attempting to scam you, pure and simple.

Don't under any circumstances give them any personal details and definitely don't give them any money or payment details. 

This is most likely the result of some kind of malware infection. So the standard advice to run anti virus and anti malware programs applies.
I would reinstall your operating system to remove his malware he has on your computer. I would also save all of your files to a back up hard drive or flash drive to help prevent any data loss.
Hope this helps!
