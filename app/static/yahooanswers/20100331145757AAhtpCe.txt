Are phone calls on Skype free?
I'm really new to Skype and I'm not sure how to navigate it properly. Are calls really free?

yes when your calling other skype ppl. but if your calling a land line or cell phone it costs you
Yes they are if you are calling someone else on skype, however if you want too call a land line or a mobile, you will have to buy something called skype credit. So calling from a land line etc will cost you.
yea as long as your calling someone with a Skype username that's online. You can purchase international calls though. here's more info:

VoIP, voice over internet protocol, callls PC to PC on skype are free all you need is a cam and headset n mic. call to land lines and mobiles cost, Freecall.com you can connect landline to landline for 0.5 euro connection and talk for free, you set them up as an international call, the computer call both numbers and the is used as a "bridge" (baby telephone exchange) to connect the call. you charge up account in  15 euro blocks and use. I use it to call my mum interstate AU, there are a few companies around so research, ADSL services with VOiP phones are ok to? Prices will vary.
