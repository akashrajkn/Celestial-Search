Firefox Advertisements?
Lately I've been getting advertisements on top of websites like Facebook and Youtube logins which only happens when i use firefox. Is this cause of an add-on ??
Not really

That's what happens when you use ILLEGAL browers.  Just use IE like a normal person.
Do you have some form of ad-blocking feature in Internet Explorer (or Safari if you're on a Mac?).

Firefox illegal?  I'd love to hear the logic behind that one...
