Do you have to pay to watch things like TV on windows media center?
I have Vista home premium and I have windows media center

windows media centre isnt for tv if you wanna watch tv u need a good video card and a service online
you will need an internet connection and also a subscriptopm//
if its TV.. you should pay..
if its movies on your PC.. you can play them...

mark as answer.. if you got the solution...

thanks.
