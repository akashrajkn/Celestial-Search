How can I take a picture url and find the original site again?
Soo, asking a question in the hair section I used a picture as a reference, but instead of putting up a link to the page the picture was one I simply right clicked and viewed the picture by itself, and then got that url.

This, to be exact; http://th09.deviantart.net/fs51/300W/i/2009/282/c/5/kayla_by_the_cards_can_lie.png

Is there a way I can get back to the web page I got to the picture with from this? because I can't remember the original url :/.
-_- I kindof want the specific girl's page.
