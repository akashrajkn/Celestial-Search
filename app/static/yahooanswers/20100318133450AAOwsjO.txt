Does anyone know how to cancel a bid on E-bay?
I put in a bid for a ¡°Mickey Mouse Outfit¡±, and now it seems I'm only six minutes away from owning Obama and his cabinet....
This was a JOKE. 
Heavy sigh.

To cancel a bid:

1. Go to the specific listing and at the top of the listing...click to the right of  "bid history"...the "# bid(s)" icon.(example "3 bids"). This will take you to the bid history page.
2. At the bottom of the bid history table is a "cancel bids" icon...click over it.  You will reach eBay's help pages, titled Managing bidders and buyers
3. The rest is easy.  Under the Managing bidders and buyers title are a list of topics...click "Canceling bids".  This will take you to the "Canceling bids" section.
4. Click over the "Canceling bids placed on your listing" icon (#1 in the yellow box).  This will take you to the bid cancellation page!  Whew!
5. Fill out the form and cancel the bid!  It's all easier than it sounds, believe me.
