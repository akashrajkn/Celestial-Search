Which sony website is the real sony website?
If you do a google search for sony, there will be sonystyle.com and sony.com. My fiance is trying to get his dad's sony sound system fixed, and he needs to know which website is the actual one. He is afraid that one of the websites could be a scam. Why would there be two websites if they have the same information?

sony.com
