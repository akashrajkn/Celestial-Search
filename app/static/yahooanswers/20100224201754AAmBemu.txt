How can I find a pink themed firefox add-on that doesn't change the general appearance of firefox?
I want a Pink Themed firefox but I want the buttons, tabs, address bar etc to remain the same. 
Or a theme that you can upload your a photo as the top part, but still has the buttons, tab, address bar etc. unchanged.

Yes, there is !

I suggest you to use Personas addon ( http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/). It can be used on all operating systems. It contains very nice themes which almost always dont make any change in the default shape and position of toolbars. I love it !

Good Luck
