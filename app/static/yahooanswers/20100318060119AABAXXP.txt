please help download?
i want to download the music video ( whataya want from me ) by adam lambert 
i want it on my cell plzz help any website for downloading it ?

youtube.com for any video
Search it on Youtube or Google video! You can download the video from them with Youtubedownloader, or Internet download manager....
Also there's a good web-site for music videos: www.vimeo.com ... you can search it first here! ;)
Firstly, download and install youtube downloader: http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-YouTube-Download.htm . Then, go to http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=adam+lambert+&search_type=&aq=f , or just search at youtube for anything you want. When you click on a video, you 'll see the URL at the upper side of browser (the one which starts with http). Copy all that thing and the use it at youtube downloader. When it gets downloaded, use a USB cable to copy it at your phone. I hope it helped.
use youtube.com to find video and then keepvid.com to download it
the same video is also in my mobile phone, first download the video from youtube using a converter http://www.eusing.com/free_youtube_downloader/youtube_converter.htm, download using this youtube downloader and convert to a format that supports your phone. you can choose the format in this app, good luck bye
