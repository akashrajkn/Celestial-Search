Can you view other people's webcams on chatroulette without having a webcam set up yourself?


where would be the fun in that? :P

but from what i know, if you have some kind of webcam software set up you can broadcast a video clip or an animated gif instead, im not sure how they do it though.
Yeah, you can.
