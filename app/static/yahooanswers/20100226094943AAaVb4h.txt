I personally play GaiaOnline. It is quite fun for a girl of her age. 
"Users of the site, known as Gaians, create a customizable avatar and a customizable virtual home for which they can purchase items using the virtual currency called gold, sometimes called gaia gold. This is given to users after playing games, posting inside the forums, and certain other events or contests; the site also rewards users every day with random gold or items with the Daily Chance."
