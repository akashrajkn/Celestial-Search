Whats a good website making site?
I'm making a website, but i need a free site. I'd like to find one that it will be an original site no .webs or anything.

Really?

Just google it
free sites will always have a .webs, or weebly, or some form of domain notification.

other then that I can only think of .tk domains, but they require actual website management.
MyWebTechs.net Web Hosting Services is the best.
