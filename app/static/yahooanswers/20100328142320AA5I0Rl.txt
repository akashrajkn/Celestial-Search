Itouch problem! Wifi suddenly stopped working!?
i've been using this itouch for several years!
today when i was on it, using the internet, it suddenly STOPPED.
i checked the settings and it said that my itouch was still connected to my network!
WHY DID IT STOP!?!?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

try rebooting your itouch hold hold until you see the apple (about30 secs) then it should work
