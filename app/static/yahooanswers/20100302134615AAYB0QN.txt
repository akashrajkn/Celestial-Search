What is the best free email service for my young children?
I am looking for a free email service for kids of 8 and 10 years old, which is above all reliable, easy to use, and also fun for youngsters to use on a regular basis.

Gmail or Yahoo Mail should be sufficient.
if you want to go EXTREMLY safe you use http://Gaggle.net
Well, as a frequent user, all I can do is recommend Google Mail, I wouldn't really say it's fun, but it sure is good! You get built in G-Talk, Google's Chat Program. You also get a Twitter-like application called 'Buzz'. I would say it is reasonably safe. Like you require, it is free and easy to use.

I suppose that really it could be fun, as they allow you to customize your Inbox with backgrounds and themes.

If you're interested, go ahead and try it: http://mail.google.com/
