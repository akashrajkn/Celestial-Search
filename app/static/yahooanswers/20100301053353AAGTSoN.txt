changing emails.....?
ive had my email for as long as i can remember having one....but i want to change it now. i want a new username and stuff...but i also want to keep my contacts and be able to tell everyone what my new email is....how should i do that?

Well what you can do is create your new email address and have the new address ready. Create a mass mail in your old email address by forwarding and cc'ing it to all your contacts so they have a heads up about your new primary email address and tell them to send emails to your new email address from now on. Get all the address from your old email and just migrate it to your new email address. Don't forget you will need to update your account details that you usually get mail from automatically for example. you get emails from a job agency regularly like 2 to 3 times a week, go to their website and update your details in there database :) you will need to do this for your accounts.

Good luck :)
