How do you reblog conversations with other people on Tumblr, or just reblogging something and adding a comment?
Where am I suppose to type my comments?

For example, When I try to reply/reblog conversations with my friends, my comments don't show up when she reblogs them... Sorry if it sounds confusing. 

Am I suppose to put it after, before the <P></P>, or another place?

REblog? As if blogging alone isn't bad enough. Like regifting, lmao.

<p> is for paragraphing.
