You must acknowledge that you'll acquiesce to Obama's wealth redistribution program and contribute your "fair share."
Hold it.  If you're setting up a paypal account for someone else that is overseas, then if that person commits fraud, you'll be on the hook for it.  First off, don't try to take anything out of it, and don't transfer any money from it or into it.  You may want to call paypal customer service and talk to them about it.  This is the kind of thing that can land you in lots of hot water.
log into paypal, under the 'my account' tab there is a bar with options, one is 'withdraw'. Just click on that and then there will be an option to 'withdraw funds to your bank account', click on that and then fill in your details.
