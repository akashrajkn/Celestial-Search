Should I get a formspring?
I don't really want one, but think it will be interesting to see what people ask me. A lot of my friends have one.
Do I have to answer all the questions that are asked?

I have one and I must admit it's really exciting when you get new questions. Some of the questions people ask you are interesting, although some are innoproproate, depending on where you 'advertise' your formspring. (eg. facebook, twitter etc.) I recommend getting one, and if you don't like it you can just not use it anymore!
you should get one but i heard it causes a lot of drama lol
i have one though.
and no you don't have to answer all the questions
all questions your asked are sent to your 'inbox' on formspring and you can choose which questions you want to answer.
if you don't want to answer some of the questions you can just delete it.
