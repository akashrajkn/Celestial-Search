Ever heard of a website called IOffer.com? What about my paypal?
Is it reliable, would you recommend it? Will my paypal still charge me if it's a bogus site?

I offer is a legitimate site, I've been selling items on there for over two years, I don't recommend anyone buying from outside of their country as there has been reports that people have ordered iphones, cellphones,etc and gotten a cheap plastic necklace or something similar in the mail, since they used the tracking information for shipping, it's your word against theirs. So I do recommend you to take extreme precaution when ordering items on there.
