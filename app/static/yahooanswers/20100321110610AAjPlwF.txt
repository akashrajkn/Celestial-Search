Does this really boost your internet speed?

i had it and it worked for a couple of days but then it stopped working i would say its kind of like in between but the good thing is  that its not spyware i thought it was but yea you might want to try it out
dont listen to that other person. there is no magic button on a website to speed up your computer.  the best way to speed up your machine is to have someone experienced to it at home.
