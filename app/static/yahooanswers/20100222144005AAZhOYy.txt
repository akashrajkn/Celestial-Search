Whats the best / most popular site for posting reviews of local shops, services, garages, pubs etc etc?
Ive tried qype and sheriff ratings but both seem a bit dead really, i think customer service reviews on the net is a great idea but not sure what the most used site is

ebay if you're trying to sell something.
Wtf? Ebay. What question is the guy above me answering? Try tripadvisor. They review EVERYWHERE
Try this.
