Unpaid item strike on ebay?
I had an unpaid item strike back around dec.  i cant remember if i had one before that or not. Where can i look to see how many i have. Also do they eventually expire after u have had them so long? What happens if u get more than 2? i am guessing your account gets suspended... for how long?

Three and you're out.
