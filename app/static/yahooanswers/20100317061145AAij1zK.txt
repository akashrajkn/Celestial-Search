Has anyone used http://www.purchasetwitterfriends.com? Does it work?
I'm helping out with marketing a business and they really need more followers on twitter to create a buzz. And the website says that they'll get you 10,000 followers, but are those followers going to STAY? Or are they gradually going to unfollow you? Because if they are then it's a stupid waste of money, and this is serious business. Money is involved.

Wow, you're pretty pathetic if you're willing to be scammed getting fake friends on TWITTER.
Why not use a free Twitter Adder like the one in the resource box below. It works on Windows systems
