how do i make my AIM buddy list private?!!!?
apparetly aim has gotten more complicated.i remade my account and its embarasing cuz i only have like...3 friends right now. and my friends can see HOW MANY BUDDIES I HAVE!!! lol if you click on my icon and select "buddy info" yo ucan see how many firends i have on my list T_T how do you get rid of that?!

Go to Menu > Privacy and you will see "Who can see my buddylist" and Choose "Just Me"
