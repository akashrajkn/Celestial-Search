LOCKERZ - Getting alot of PTZ by making alot of email accounts - can u get banned for it?
If i kept makign msn email addresses, then using my lockerz account to invite them and then sign the addresses up to lockerz, i could get 120PTZ a hour.

is it ok to do this?
could i get banned?
or totally safe?

You'll get banned, there is no question about it. 
Lockerz invests a lot of money into catching cheaters
You can only have one, they ban people with more than one.

9.How many accounts can I have?
 Members are entitled to one account per person. Each eligible person within a household can have 
 their own account.
its not ok but i did it i made 15 yahoo accounts 2 gmail and 3 msn still not banned dont use those 10 minute emails that last for 10minutes
