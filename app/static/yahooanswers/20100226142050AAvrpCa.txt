Bought Mp3s from amazon but I had a payment problem...?
Well yes I bought an mp3 and that went through fine I did the whole one click buy but then I bought two more and put them in my basket first. I should've had enough money for all 3 if only just on my card. I'm going to get a mini statememnt tomorrow to see if I've been charged.but I got this in an e-mail.
"We are writing to let you know that we have not received a valid payment method for the above order (order number here) and it is now cancelled. Please note you will need to place a new order for the item(s) you wished to purchase. " 
Since they're mp3s I've already got them so I don't see how it can be cancelled?
Do I need to put money in my bank again or maybe even buy them again?

If you go to the the account section, there should be a link to digital orders. If you look there, it should list all the ones that you're having problems with. You can open up each order and select another method of payment there.

As you already have a copy of the mp3s the payment problem won't stop you from keeping them, but until it's fixed you won't be allowed to buy more. Furthermore, they will be entitled to come after you for the money you still owe them, as you have the product and you haven't paid for it.
