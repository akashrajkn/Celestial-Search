What does 2-day shipping mean on amazon?
If I sign up for the 1 month free trial of amazon prime then I get 2-day shipping on my eligible items. Does 2-day shipping mean that they ship the item within 2 days or does it mean that it arrives within 2 days?

Usually it ships next day and then you'll get shortly after.
You will get it in two days...
It means that the shipping part takes 2 business days from the time it leaves Amazon.
i think it means its going to take to days to get to you.
