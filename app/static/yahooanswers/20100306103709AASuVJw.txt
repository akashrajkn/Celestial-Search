formspring.me PLEASEEEE HELPPP!!!!!!!?
okay so i  have two questions:
1. i answered some questions and it's been like an hour and none of them have showed up on my profile and they're not in my inbox either. so what happened to them? is it just taking a while to show up? im positive i didn't delete any.
2. i heard about some people asking something anonymously on someone's formspring and later it showed who they were! i'm freaking out. is that possible, or did they just forget to check "say anonymously" and then they thought they did?

thanks so much to anyone who answers!

Did you get it fixed?
