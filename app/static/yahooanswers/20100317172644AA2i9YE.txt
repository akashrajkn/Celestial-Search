What should I name my blog?
I'm planning to post my opinion on different video games i've played, as well as write about recent events that happened to me. What should i name my blog? Can i change the name of my blog if i wanted to? Thanks in advance!

If you created your blog on one of the big ones like blogspot or wordpress then you can't change the name because the subdomain is your name.  Why not just make 2 different blogs 1 for games and 1 for you since they are free.

But to name it, how about "video game opinions you actually want to read"? heheh
