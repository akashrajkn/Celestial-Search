Will i have to use a credit card even if its Cash on collection?
Does it cost to Bid?

It doesnt cost to bid but you can use a debit card and go through paypal, set a paypal account up and use a debit card :)
bidding is free but many sellers don't like first time buyers.
If possible get a friend who already has an account to buy for you.

yes you do need to register to bid on ebay no it doesn't cost to bid only when you win you don't need a credit or debit card but a lot of people on ebay only accept payment through paypal for which you will need a card
It doesn't cost to bid on an item.
You don't have to use a credit card. You can use a debit cardm through PayPal, which helps to protect your transactions. But if the item is cash on collection then you won't need to use one.
No it's free to bid. You only pay if you win. I however do NOT recommend cash as a way for paying that is only asking for trouble. If you want to be 100% safe use paypal, credit card or check. If you use cash there will be no proof at all that you paid for the item.
its totally free to bid, and yes you need a credit/debt card to create an account to stop spammers and banned users rejoining. if the person has a contact us section. 

Will i have to use a credit card even if its Cash on collection? (no, since if your the winning bid you'll choose open to pay and choose cheque and then the other person will close the aution if your paying with cash).
Its free to bid and make an account.
If you dont want to use creditcard, then see if you can send a check to the person.
