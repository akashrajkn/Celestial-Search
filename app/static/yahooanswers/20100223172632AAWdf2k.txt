What are some legit Freebie/Sample Sites?
There is nothing I like more than free stuff and samples of stuff. :'D. However, finding it on the internet is way-difficult, because everything looks a bit suspicious. So, if you could, can you give me some sites that are LEGIT that I can get free samples and whatnot of . . . well, pretty much anything?
