What should I do when I see anything inappropriate on a social networking website?
When I go on Facebook, Myspace or Myyearbook (my favorite social networking websites), I sometimes see very inappropriate stuff.  What should I do about it?

All of those have links to 'report abuse' or something similar.  Pictures, messages, etc., all of them have those places to click.

Be careful with that, though.  Make sure it's really inappropriate according to the community guidelines.  You can't just report messages or pictures you don't like.
It depends what your considering inappropriate. If it's against the terms & conditions of that site, then you should be able to email the site support and let them know. If it's just against your personal sensibilities, then just click elsewhere. There's a lot of things that some people find offensive that are not against the rules of the sites.
Report it - Each site will have a Page where you can report inappropiate stuff. If they will do nothing then e-mail the site/page/persons details to your local police
