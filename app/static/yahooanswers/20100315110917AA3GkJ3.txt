What is Ping.fm? I just saw someone post a status on FB using it...?
I saw somebody use it once on facebook, and I'm wondering what it is, and what you can do on it.

Ping.fm basically allows you to update all your social networking sites at once. For example if you use facebook and twitter, this site will update them both for you, however you only need to type the update once on ping.fm.
Hope this helped.
