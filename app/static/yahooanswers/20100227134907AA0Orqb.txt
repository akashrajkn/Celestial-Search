how do i get my main bar back for Firefox?
My mom was on my computer and some how she got rid of the bar in Firefox that shows the file, favorite, tools and stuff like that. I can't figure out to get it back because it is blank up there. Please help!!!

Press Alt on your keyboard or right click somewhere near the refresh/home button and click menu bar..


There ya go!
