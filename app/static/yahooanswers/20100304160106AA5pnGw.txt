Is EU Ticket Shop legit? Has anyone had any experience with them?
Last night I ordered tickets for Eminem at T in the Park from this website: http://euticketshop.com/ They were ?85 each which I didn't mind paying but now I'm starting to worry, since the official T in the Park website has a warning saying be careful not to buy fake tickets; we recommend ticketmaster.com.

The most worrying thing to me is that the EU ticket shop people say they won't send me the tickets until a week before the concert, which is in July. This seems suspicious to me and I'm going to be nervous waiting to see whether they arrive or not. Can anyone tell me if their website is a scam?

This site has only been in business for seven weeks

Site regstered in the US, registered office supposedly in London but their contact number is an 0161 number which is definitely not London

Registered office address is: 

PO Box 71 

56 Tavistock Place
London
WC1H 9RG
I ordered a weekend ticket the other day off them. They sent me an email but no money has been taken off my account. I might just go to another place. 

I hear there is more TITP tickets to come out anyway.... hopefully
