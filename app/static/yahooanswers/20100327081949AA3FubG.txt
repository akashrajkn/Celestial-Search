Polvore question! Help Please!!?
Hey guys, i really need help with this! Can somebody tell me how to create a banner for your profile that shows your sets and specified quote or whatever? Please help, i have no clue how to do this!
here is a sample of a profile that i want mine to look like---------->http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/profile?id=949048
can anyone tell me how to do this?

i just made a polyvore two days ago so i'm not really sure if this will work, but try it..it probably won't work haha. 

go to your profile
click "edit my profile"
go down to "profile appearance"
and click "display my collections"

also, comment on my sets! they're kind of sucky, but i just started to hopefully they'll get better :)
