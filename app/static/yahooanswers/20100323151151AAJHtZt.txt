Recommend an accurate but FREE website that detects plageriusm?
A website where i am able to scan essays and check accuratley if there is any plageruism that has been used :]

Lots of schools use Turnitin.com but if your school or regional district doesn't want to implement that, you can try http://www.articlechecker.com/

The space for the URL is only if you are checking a website.
Just type a phrase from the essay that seems plagiarized and google it. If it is copy and paste the original work will pop up in the search.
