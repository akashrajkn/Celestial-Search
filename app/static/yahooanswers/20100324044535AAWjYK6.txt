Why don't website give you the option to delete your accout if you decided you don't want to use their service?


Most do. Which site are you trying to unsubscribe from? perhaps someone can tell you how to do it.
there's always a way they just want to make it hard for you to cancel. try under ''contact us'' or FAQ's
