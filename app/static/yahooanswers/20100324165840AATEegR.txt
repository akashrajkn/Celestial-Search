Having Trouble With SouthParkStudios.com, help please?
Hi.
I just found out about southparkstudios.com and I started using it last night. It worked perfectly. But, tonight, when I tried it, it's not working right. 
The video "loads" and the commercial plays. then, the South Park into comes on and the episode is over, it says. Like, the loading bar says it's only got 11 seconds which is total BS. In other words, something is whacked and not going right. The episode doesn't actually play anything more than the intro part.
Help, please? I wanna watch SP(cries).
LOL: I'm not in Canda

Try buffering by pausing the video?
Or try clearing your cache and cookies (Just do a simple Google/whatever search engine you use)
Maybe it's blocked in Canada.
You can watch them here!
