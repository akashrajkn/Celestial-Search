Social site automatically uploading picture?
I just joined a new social network- Holypal- and it automatically uploaded a picture for me. 

It just so happened to be a picture of me and an old dog of mine, and I don't like to see pictures of him, it upsets me.

I looked at the profiles of other newcomers, who just have a plain avatar with no picture, as if they haven't added a pic yet. I didn't either, it chose one for me?

The picture doesn't even appear in "my photos", and I have no idea how to delete it.

I find this bizare. How did the site pick a pic for me, but not for other people? 

Is this normal? Is this legal/aloud? What if it had picked an innappropriote picture for the internet? Isn't that a violation of privacy? Is this some kind of glitch/bug? How did this happen? 

Has this happened to anyone else before? 

I consulted the site, but who knows how long that could take...

I'm extremely baffled...

what ?
Maybe a friend of yours who uses the site had already uploaded it and the site automatically made it your profile pic since you didn't have one. Just a guess.
