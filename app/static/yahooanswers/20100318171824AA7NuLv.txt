How much does Rogers Canada charge for extra internet GB used?
I have a 60GB internet package and I was just wondering that, if I use more than that how much does Rogers charge? How much $ for 1 extra GB? I checked on their site and could not find it, so please help, ask any questions and I will be happy to answer them in the additional details section.

It's $5 for every extra GB.
