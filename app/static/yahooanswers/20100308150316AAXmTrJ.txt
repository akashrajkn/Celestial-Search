i want to have a you@yourname email with email forwarding capability. any ideas who can provide it ?
i know it's not free though :D

Not entirely sure on the subject but I think you have to actually own the domain name to have an email to it.

Example.
If I wanted the email "jordan@jordan.co.uk" I would have to own the domain name "jordan.co.uk", then I would have to link that up with a web host and configure an email account through them.
youll need to register and purchase a domain name at webs.com
for $99.95 a year, you will have 5 custom email addresses.

you have to own the @yourname website. buy it from something like godaddy.com
Then once u buy it you have the option to set up email adresses.
