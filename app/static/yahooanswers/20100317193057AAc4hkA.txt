what happens if verizon catches me downloading torrents (Facts not Opinions please)?


They will turn you over to the proper authorities who will arrent/fine you.  Seriously.  Deal with it.  Did you seriously think you could break the law with no repurcussions?
Nothing. You aren't stealing from them. They don't care.
