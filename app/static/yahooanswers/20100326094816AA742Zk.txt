How to I get rid of a virus?
Computer has a virus and can't get safe mode to work. I tap F8 and it goes to the screen and when I click on run safe mode it loads halfway down the screen and then stops loading. Either safe mode isnt working or this virus wont let me load anything. When I log onto the computer I cannot run anything because of the virus. How do I get rid of the virus? Would i need to re-download windows? I have a dell mini 10 that runs windows XP
cant download antivirus if i cant log on to computer then go online....
do they sell the reformat disc anywhere?
like i said i have a dell mini which is a netbook so no cd drive. how do i reinstall windows then?

install antivirus - scan .it will get rid of all viruses
you first will need the installation disc you got with your computer...
if you dont have that,youre screwed,and you laptop will most likely die,BUT if you do,you will need to format the computer...
