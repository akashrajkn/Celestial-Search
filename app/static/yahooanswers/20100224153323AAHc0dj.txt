What is a good site to use for Photo Hosting which will take 18,000 photos?
I have a book shop and need a site to host my photos of my books. I would love it to be free. I have over 18,000 books to upload to the site so they have to except almost unlimited photos. Please help. Thanks! Ann

try flickr, picasa, photobucket...

Tips:
18000 photos is too much, i suggest you can sort the pics and combine the related photos into together, and then saved on your pc or upload flickr to  conserve. Here, you can learn how to join photos together:  http://www.photo-collage-software.com/tutorial/hot-christmas-collage-layouts.html#173

Hope this helps.
seeing the volume of contents the only feasible way i would suggest is register your own domain name and host your own site, try http://www.xnynz.com/ which inherently provides photo album feature
You can host it with www.oceanwalker.org
