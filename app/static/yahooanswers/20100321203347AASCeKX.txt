Am i the only one who's Firefox keep crashing since the last update (3.6)?


NO!! every since i got the update my internet decides to quit every 20 minutes... it's really irratating and i'm regretting buying my apple
I've noticed a difference in performance in switching from one web page to another, etc., but I think it may have had something to do with Comcast switching from McAfee to Norton.  

I could be wrong though.  I have no idea what is going on.
