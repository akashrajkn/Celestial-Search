how to get people to follow someone on twitter?
i'm trying to win a cd and i need to get 10 people to follow @NEWMUSICINFERNO and tell him i sent them, but i don't have a lot of followers and i still need 7 more people to follow him, what should i do?

P.S if you want to help me my twitter is @cellii23 just follow ^^ him and say i sent you, i would appreciate it so much, and i will follow you too if you want :D

Well u can ask people here or in other forums to follow u :)

Hey i'll follow u :)
The key to getting followers in Twitter is by following others.  However, you probably don't want to follow just anybody.  You want to follow people who are interested in the things that you are interested in.  So make a list of 7 keywords or things that you are interested in and then watch this video about how to sign-up for a free Twitter application that will allow you to follow people using your keywords.  Because you both share an interest, there is a high probability that they will follow you back.
