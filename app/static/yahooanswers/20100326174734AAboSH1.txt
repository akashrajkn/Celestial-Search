What Web Hosting services offer video streaming on your website?
I have a website hosted by godaddy.com but unless I buy the big dedicated server hosting plans, I can do live video streaming.

I have a camera setup at my church and I want to stream our services LIVE.  With godaddy I cant unless I purchase a dedicated server hosting plan which start at like $60/month. Is there anything cheaper  out there?  Thanks!
