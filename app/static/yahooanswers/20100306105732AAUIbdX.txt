'public' wifi connection with utorrent?
I share a wifi connection with my landlord and utorrent hasn't worked since I started using it. I'm assuming its because of that, though I'm really not sure. I get a decent enough connection to the internet and my utorrent is up to date. Any suggestions on getting it to download my queue?

maybe the port you are using is blocked by the router another possibility is the port you are using is forwarded to another pc in the router settings

So try changing the port used

BTW torrents can kill the internet speed for all other users so be wary using them
