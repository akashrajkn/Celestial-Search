meez? what the crappp!?
Umm okay i have no idea what meez is, but my friend wants to know if you crossdress and you had to pay, Do you have to pay for the item again if something messes up?

No , It you already bought it then you dont have to buy it again . I know this because i have a meez and i get on it every day
You have to questions so im gonna answer them.Meez is an online virtual world were you have to be 13 or older,watch videos while talking to friends,and chill out in your created room.theres more to it though.No not nessisarily .when something messes up, you just check in your virtual closet to see if its there. if its not you will have to buy it again or you can just refresh and see where it takes you. i did that and got all the money that i spended on a dress back and just bought it again. double check your closet to see if the out fit is there. email me if there is any furthet questions
