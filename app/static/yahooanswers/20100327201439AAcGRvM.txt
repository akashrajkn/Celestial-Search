Will downloading a different internet browser make my computer slower?
I have IE and I wanted to try Firefox but my computer is already really slow. (I have high speed internet if that helps anything)
Also,will I lose any documents or anything else if I download a different internet browser?

It will not affect any of your files, and really it will probably be faster.  Mozilla firefox is quite a bit faster than internet explorer.
welll i have 5 different browsers on mine and they didnt slow it down but i know for a fact norton will make ur computer rlly slow
One: it depends on how old your computer is, and how much room it has up.

If it is fairly new, and has memory, it shouldn't, I have both IE and firefox and it doesn't effect mine.
no it wont.
Firefox is a pretty low demanding browser.
and no, you won't lose any of your documents.
If you are concerned about your computer running slowly, you should clean it up (history, cookies, temporary files, defragment, etc.) and remove programs that you do not use. Having a second browser is a good idea and Firefox is much better than IE (in my opinion). It won't affect your documents and you can always import your bookmarked websites into the Firefox browser.
IT WONT AFFECT YOUR PC SPEED. IF YOUR PC IS RUNNING SLOW, TRY DUMPING TEMP INTERNET FILES AND SHUTTING DOWN SOME START UP PROGRAMS.
