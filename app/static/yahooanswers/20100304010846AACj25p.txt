What type of paypal account do I need?
I want to open a paypal account so I can use ebay, but I'm not sure which type of account to get. I want to buy things, but also to sell some of the stuff I no longer need or use. So can anyone tell me which sort? I know it's not business, but which one of the other two? 
Thanks in advance.

Just go to paypal.com and start new personal account. Heres what you can do with personal account.....

Send money     
24-hour fraud surveillance     
Customer Service availability     
eBay Tools 
Accept credit or debit cards

Heres page to show all options...

you can choose personal account
If you're going to sell as well, you should have a business or premier account. I started out with a personal account, and then had to upgrade when I started selling.

Good luck!
