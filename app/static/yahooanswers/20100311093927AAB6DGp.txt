1. Go to the orkut sign-in page. 
2. Click the I cannot access my account link. 
3. Follow the instructions for submitting your email address. For security purposes, the email address you enter needs to be your primary email address or the email address you use to sign in to orkut. 

As I'm aware, they just use your google account to access orkut. It's your gmail/google username and password.


Delete your orkut profile
1. Log into Orkut
2. Click settings on the left sidebar of your profile.
3. On the general tab, click delete my orkut account.
4. You'll be taken to a page that gives further instructions and a link to delete my account. Clicking this link will re-direct you to the Delete orkut page of your Google Account.
5. Check the box confirming that you really want to delete your orkut profile from your Google Account.
6. Once you enter your password and click Remove orkut you will no longer be able to log into orkut.com, but your Google Account will remain active. Please do not try to access your orkut profile again, since this action may restore it.
