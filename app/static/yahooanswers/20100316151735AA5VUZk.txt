On Gaiaonline, my avatar, nor my friend's avatar show up and I can't log in. What's wrong?
I've tried, and I've used my password and tried to retrieve the password, yet nothing works. Gaia says that my e-mail isn't in the database, but when I tried using it for a new account, it said that my e-mail was already in use. It won't show many of my friends' avatars, and mine won't show up. My profile also change, reverted to its standard look. I really hate this, and I think I've been hacked. Has this happen before? Is this normal? Is there a way to fix this problem?

the server probably crashed or something. I can't get on mine either. I can get to my topics but gaia keeps messing up. THe admins might fix it as soon as possible though
Yeah my account is just missing. My bf can get on his and some of my mules can, but not the account that was actually worth something e.e
