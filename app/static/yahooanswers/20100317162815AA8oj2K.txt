connect internet upstairs?
we have the little comcaast box downstairs that we have a lap top plugged up to. I want to have internet upstairs on my computer. we don't have wireless how can i connect the one upstairs?

You don't have wireless you won't connect.
Comcast does have long cables that could make it upstairs (depends how far away that is) so you could buy one and the might install it threw the wall
unless you have a really long cable you will need a wirless router. 

also if your computer does not have wirless internet capabalities you will need to get a wirless network adapter. i have one of these and they are real easy to use you just plug them into a usb port.
