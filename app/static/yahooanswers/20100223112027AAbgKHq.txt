Question about Internet Trolls?
When internet trolls are exposed to sunlight, do they turn to stone like Bilbo's trolls? Or can they only be destroyed by fire or acid like Dungeons & Dragons trolls?  Do Internet Trolls also regenerate their hit points?

Internet Trolls can only be destroyed by ignoring them,after a few days they self destruct and turn to poo.
While weaker ones can sometimes be slain by ridicule and sarcasm, most thrive on any reactions they get. About all you can do with those is stop feeding them until they eventually starve for attention and move on for fresher feeding grounds.
