How Can I Find A Yahoo Users Email Address?
I am just not internet savvy! I checked the Yahoo whatchamajig and they list a "user name" for an old friend of mine after I put in his real name. "Tonguewrestler" came up....LOL...But that is not his email address@Yahoo.com.
How can I get it?
We haven't talked in about 8 years and I would like to send him an email.
Thanks!

you cannot search the yahoo Email address Directory 
Yahoo protects it's user's privacy 

Try to search in google with his name or any info you know 
and see what you get

if you are lucky then you will get his mail


thanks
