Which email provider comes with the best perks?
hotmail sure does have nice backgrounds, but i like the feel of yahoo... and aol is just so vibrant... like full of life, the others are dull and boring, but aol is so freaking messy and unorganized...

It would be impossible for an e-mail provider to suit everybody's taste 100%.
Unless you are able to set up as a provider yourself, you have to be content with choosing the provider that most closely suits your requirement
