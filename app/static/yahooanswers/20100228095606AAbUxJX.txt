Why do I get kicked off the Internet?
I have a problem with my internet connection. I have Road Runner cable internet and it is very fast, yet when I play on Xbox Live and even when I used to play World of Warcraft online I will just get kicked. I can log right back in but it is very annoying and messes up the whole match I was in with friends on Live. You don't even notice if your simply surfing the internet because it's like it just flickers for 2 seconds or something.

Sounds like a bad cable connection, so call them and have it checked.
