Name ideas for a PTC site?
I am opening up a 'Pay To Click' site that will be much better than other PTC sites. It'll have lower-priced advertising and users will be able to earn more money per click. I've got the money to set it up, and I've got the software to set it up, now all I need is a name that sounds serious and will bring users in.
