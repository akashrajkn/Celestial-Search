a decent internet providers?
hai im wondering what internet provider everyone is using cause i want to change mine, im currently using optimum online but its 60$ per month and thats way too much to be paying cause all i really do is get on for msn and sometimes facebook. so yea im looking for something with decent connection speed at a decent price (be good if it was a big provider because some is limited to a certain area im living in new jersey)

I am not sure what New Jersey has but here in Kentucky we have Windstream.  I pay 60.00 as well though but I do get unlimited long distance phone, 32 calling features and 12 Meg internet.
i have AT&T and i am very happy with it, you get many discounts if you have them for your cell phone and home phone and tv. but i am very satisfied, and most of my friends use them too. they use 2wire modems which is my personal favorite and works the best.
i pay for comcast 45 a month and its really fast i can download at 20mbps :D
im in california btw
