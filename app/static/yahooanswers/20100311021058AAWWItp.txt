What alternatives do you recommend to istockphoto.com?
I'm looking for a better value.

this is a free stock photo website.  They don't have quite as many photos, but still a lot.  Plus they are all free.  just sign up for a free account.  You can't complain about that right?
Dreamstime.com is a good one.  Also Artbreak.com includes very good photography and other art work and you are able to work out the price with the photographer.
