How can I change my NAT type to "open"?
I'm a PC gamer and I can't join my friend's party in MW2 due to my NAT type being "strict". I have opened "Computer", found "Network" and then found my router. In its "properties" I have all the details about it; "Serial number" and "MAC address" and other such random things.

Any useful suggestions would be appreciated.

You need to know what you're talking about before asking the question.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation

Once you've read that, read the router's manual.
If you have horrible Windows, you might have to configure the firewall there too, in which case, read the manual.

And one last thing, read the manual of the game.
