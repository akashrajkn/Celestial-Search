i want rapidshare premium account?
please tell me how to get rapidshare premium account free.

They are not free. Jeez they're not even expensive... how come you people can't afford to spare the smallest amounts of money.
@Mr S - Agreed
This is an easy way to get a premium account.........

*Go to 

http://www.AWSurveys.com/HomeMain.cfm?RefID=arunprasadq

*Just click on the surveys and you get 4 $ for each survey

*within 5 min i earned 27 dollars

*you can redeem them to get a premium account
be careful with survey site.....some site they might cheat you with no cash out  when you have more than 75$
You don't really need a premium account. There are programs that download the files from rapidshare without worrying about the free account limitations. You can just queue up a bunch of files and let the program handle the rest. 

Check out the link in my source, it has the programs you need. Good luck!
