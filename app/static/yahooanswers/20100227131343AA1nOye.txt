Is there a pay as you go internet?
My parents would only use it about once a week , they dont want a monthly bill and cannot get to a library is there a pay as you go like in cell phones? They want to get a laptop so how can I get this going for them?

well if you are in the UK BT offer a dial-up pas as you go service but also vodafone give you wireless mobile broadband on a pay as you go schem with there wireless dongles
Yes you can get pay as you go internet , but you must make sure that you can get it in your area ..It is also a more expensive way on getting the internet

Sorry I can't really help much more cause I live in the UK and only know about mobile broadband in the UK and not the US
N Telos its a cellphone provider they have a usb adapter that picks up like a cell phone its pay by the month no contract if you don't pay it cuts off but no extra charges for reactivating that's all I know about...... My not be in your parents area..
