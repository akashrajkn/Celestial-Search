How is the internet connected to my brother's Wii?
My brother can get on any page on the Internet with his Wii Console. How does he do that when we don't pay for wireless internet or have our home internet hook up to it. It's like the Wii came with it's own free internet package. 

I don't how, but it's weird.......

He could be stealing any nearby neighbors unsecured wireless signal.

While it is technically illegal, as long as he doesn't use excessive bandwidth or make it obvious (downloading files, torrents, using the bandwidth..ect.) that he is on it to the owner, he will not get caught.
He's most likely connected to someone else's wifi network.
Probably using your neighbor's wireless.  Wii does not come with its own internet connection.
