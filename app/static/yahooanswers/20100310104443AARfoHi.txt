What are some of the best "Blog" websites?
I would like to start my own blog

Wordpress, Livejournal, Blogger - in that order.
Hey B,

I lean toward Wordpress.com simply for the ease and simplicity.

There's also Blogger.com. Not one of my favorites because it's owned by Google and they have a history of locking people out of their own blogs.

Now, in fairness I nave to say they do this because of an appearance of violation of the terms of service.
That said, they don't warn you and ask for an explanation. They just lock you out without warning and wait for you to find them.

So, as a newby I recommend Wordpress.com
