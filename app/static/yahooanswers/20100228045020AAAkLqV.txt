can you get arrested on omelgle?
can you? i am just curios because i have nothing better to do today, i have been out in the rain because i am bored so i was just asking this question, :) thanx

And just what is "omelgle" when it's at home in the dry and warm then?
No, but you can get banned.  Why?  Have you been violating their TOS?
