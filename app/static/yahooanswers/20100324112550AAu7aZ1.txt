Is it illegal to download Japanese/Korean/Taiwanese TV shows in the UK?
If it's stuff that isn't licensed over here, hasn't been bought by this region - is only ever going to be shown in Asia - how else are we supposed to see it? Pay three times its worth to have it shipped over?

lol, just download it... i think the US is the only country that is serious about piracy.
Anyways, downloading the TV shows harms no one. so no harm done, why not download them?? The Japanese gain popularity, so it doesn't matter. So basically, if u can't buy them, just download them.
Anyways, the UKains (english) shud not rlly care whether or not u download or not. Its not their film industry. I don't think its illegal and if it is than that's just stupid.
