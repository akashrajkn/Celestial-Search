Is there a way around those "complete a survey" things?
So you go on a website and you're really excited to enjoy its content. Then a box pops up and says you can't view the page until you complete a survey.

All the surveys available require your cell phone number at the end.

Obviously, it's a trap and you'll end up getting loads of texts forever and paying the phone company a million dollars. 

But still, a lot of my favorite websites have this lock on them. Is there a way I can cheat this survey thing? I tried putting in fake phone numbers, but it knows they're not valid. I also tried putting in real phone numbers of celebrities etc, but it asks you to validate with a code that it sent the number you entered. 

Can I cheat around this?

There is a sneaky website that can give you totally fake phone numbers, names, adresses, etc. 
Trust me, it doesn't give you some poor guy in Idaho's info, it is totally randomized. The link is belwo. Enjoy!
