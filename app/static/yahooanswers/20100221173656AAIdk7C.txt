Can I purchase seller items with credit that eBay gave me?
I received credit from eBay, because they charged me for a transaction that the buyer backed out of.  Can I use that credit to put toward my purchase of an item that someone is selling?

Sure! It should show up in your My Ebay control panel.

It isn't really a question about how to find stuff to sell but more of a question of finding items THAT sell. There are tons of people who have tried to sell items they bought wholesale on Ebay and end up with only a few clicks/views. There is a trick that Power Sellers use to find the "Hot Items". "Hot Items" are those that get alot of views which therefore get alot of buys. 

You can read about that trick and watch a quick video at http://www.offcost.com/ebay
