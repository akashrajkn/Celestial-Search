Am I the only one who like to use the same ID for everything online?
I've got the habit of using the same net ID for everything I do online - forums, Ebay, AIM, etc...

Unless I have a real reason to use a different ID, each time I sign up for something I just use the same ID without thinking about it. Is that normal?

Theres nothing wrong with doing that! At least you wont forget what it is..
