Which is better: hotmail or gmail?
I'm currently using hotmail, but a couple of my friends have been saying gmail is better. Which do you prefer, and why?

The reason I'm using hotmail is because when it's the same e-mail for my MSN, but apparently you can connect your msn with your gmail? Can someone explain that?

I prefer hotmail.  I think it's easier to use and I know when I get an email because it notifies me through my MSN.
I have both. 

Gmail is for emailing, and looking professional (plus it's easier to navigate), and I have a separate hotmail account for MSN. :)
Without any doubt: GMAIL is better...
Gmail
gmail is better , it is fast and easy.
