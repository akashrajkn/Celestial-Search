The first Internet browser in history,what is it called?
10 points if you're very quick!!
The first Internet browser in it's story
that allows you to navigate.

Netscape.  Specifically Netscape Navigator.
The very 1st was in fact WorldWideWeb, by Tim Berners-Lee, 1991. At that time it was the only way to access the internet. This was followed in 1993 by NCSA Mosaic. Though it's true to say that the netscape Navigator was the one that was the 1st to be widely used.
It was the world wide web, but the answer you may be looking for is Mosaic or Opera, both of those were considered the first main stream browsers.  Mosaic came first and Opera about a year later
They are all wrong!.

The first internet browser in history was not Netscape, that was the first commercial one.

The first web browser was NCSA Mosaic!
