What website can I watch episodes of The Hills on?
I live in Australia by the way so not every site works, eg MTV wont work..

try hulu, youtube or tv.com
try www.fancast.com maybe? not too sure but I know they have television shows on there.
try this website it should work http://www.free-tv-video-online.info/internet/the_hills/
