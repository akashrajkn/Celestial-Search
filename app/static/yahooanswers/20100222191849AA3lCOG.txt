eBay selling question?
Tomorrow, eBay is having a 50% off all auction style listing fees. My question is this: If I write my auction listings, complete the listing transaction, but pay the 10 cents ( I think its 10 cents) to have it start later in the week- do I still get 50% off? Or will I not because the auction is starting later in the week and not on the 50% discount days. Thanks!

I think so, because it's basically getting listed now, but it's scheduled to be live another day. BUT, I an be wrong and probably but not sure.

No! You have to do the listing while the offer is active!
