How do i get my links from photobucket to work on yahoo answers?
i logged in, went to account settings, went to album settings and made it public. I then copy pasted the URL here to each pic and no one can see the pix. I then went to each pic individually and clicked "share" then "get link code" then copy pasted the thing from "get HTML codes &blogs" that doesnt work =(


what do i do to get them to work???

thanks!
but ive seen others do it. ive clicked the links even when i didnt have an account with P. bucket

Your pictures from Photobucket cannot be shown here in Answers, only the link can be put here. e.g. http://www.allora-and-district-historical-society-inc.com/
