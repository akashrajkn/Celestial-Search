question about a website?
so i went to www.secret.com and i looked at there deodorants and i noticed they had every one of there products except the platinum which i know they still make because i purchased a platinum secret deodorant today. whats the website where i can view the secret platinum deodorants. the secret website does not have them but it has scent expressions and all the scents there but still i would like to view the platinums online and all of the scents. whats the official site to see the secret platinum deodorants. www.secret is most definitely not. :(

If you go to the FAQ section of  the Secret.com website it says the following...

Is it true that Secret Platinum has been replaced with Secret Flawless??

Yes, it's true. As of May of 2008, Secret Platinum is no longer available. Instead, you will find Secret Flawless? on store shelves. So, if you're a devoted Platinum user, have no fear. The Flawless? line has something perfect for you, including Flawless Renewal?. With movement-activated odor protection, the more you move, the more it works.
See all Flawless Invisible Solids, Clear Gels and Conditioning Solids.

Hope this helps
there are a few things you can do either search that product on the site or google or just go look in stores
