im looking to sell some small things online, and i dont know how to sell them :S?
hi i have a few small things i want to sell online. i wanted to use paypal but i guess i lose money when i sell somehing (or something like that) so i dont want to lose that small profit. im a student right now and i would like that money so i can invest it into a laptop for when i go to university (1 1/2 years more to go). is there a website where i can sell things so i get all the money i ask for? and its a more customer seller kinda thing?
thanks
