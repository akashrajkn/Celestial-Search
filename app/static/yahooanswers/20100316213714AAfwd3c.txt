I have a question about Tumblr/Tumblogs?
I have 2 tumblogs.
I don't use the 1st one like, at all. My second one, however is pretty popular, and I keep up with it well. I know I can't delete my 1st one without loosing my 2nd one, so I'm trying to get around this.
Could I change the name of my first one to the second one, and then delete the second one?
like Change blog A's name to blog B, then delete blog B.
What would be the cons of this?

No you cannot at this time.

(From the Tumblr FAQ page):
Can I change which blog is the default blog for my account? Can I transfer a default blog to another account? Can I delete my default blog?
Changing the default blog or moving a default blog to another account are not possible at this time. And, you cannot delete the default blog without deleting your entire Tumblr account.
don't do it. my friend had the same problem and she did exactly what your trying to do and she lost hundreds of followers!!!! just leave things as they are now!

follow me, reblog me
