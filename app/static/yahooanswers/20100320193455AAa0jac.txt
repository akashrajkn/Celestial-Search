Possibly a website error. If you want to know if the problem is with the site, or is it an error with your connection or if they blocked you, try this website:
bypassthat.com
If the page loads normally after entering the address, then the website is working and the problem can be in your connections or your IP adress has been blocked.

You can also try this website in order to know if the page is down just for you:
