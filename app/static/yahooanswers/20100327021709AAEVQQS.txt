Cannot stream videos or play games on sites like miniclip etc.!!?
I don't know what happened, but one fine day - yesterday - I turned my computer on, went on Firefox
(I have version 3.6.2) and wanted to watch a YouTube Video... Firefox just crashed.

Then I went on Miniclip.com, tried to play a game, and Firefox just crashed again.

On ANY site I go, if there is any flash game or a video, Firefox crashes. The same goes with the Internet Explorer.

I thought it could be a problem with the Adobe Flash Player, so I downloaded it again, successfully installed it(at least that's what it said)...
but still the same is happening!

Can anyone please help me?

Thanks a lot!
Dude I'm on Windows 7, not Ubuntu, sorry.

The problem lies with a bug in firefox that is triggered by flash programs.
