I need a Virtual CC.?
Can someone tell me some sites that sells VCCs?
No SCAM sites!
VCC = Virtual Credit Card

I need one to verify my PayPal account.

what are VCC
I'm assuming you mean a virtual or temporary credit card number.  Here are a couple of services:

Bank of America ShopSafe:

Citibank Virtual Account Numbers (you'll need to scroll down a bit):

PayPal has the Secure Card (search for it -- links to the help pages don't seem to work):

A new card called the Revolution Card is apparently secure and anonymous:

Good luck!
