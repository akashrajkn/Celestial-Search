Any other official Gorillaz Twitter accounts?
I've been searching, but I don't know how to tell which ones are genuine and which ones are fake. The only one I'm 100% sure about is Murdoc's 'MurdocGorillaz' account, as this is what sparked a question in my mind: do any of the other band members have accounts? (Well, maybe not Noodle.)

I know it's a long shot asking here, but I don't know of any other way than to ask the perhaps well-informed fans of Gorillaz.

Unfortunately I don't believe so. If you check the band's official page, it might give you updates if they get Twitters in the future.
