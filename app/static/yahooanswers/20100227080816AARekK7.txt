Which is the best internet shopping giftcard?
More for UK peeps, but I want to get my friend a giftcard that lets you buy anything online (like a prepaid visa), which ones the best generally? ive heard of 3v and the mastercard ones, but are there ones i can get in like, whsmith that are good? any tips?

ebay is always good. its fun bidding on things and they can get what they want for cheaper
amazon, my uncle got me one, choices were a joyyyy
