Does LOCKERZ  really give away ipod touch away totally free ?
I dont want fake answers.

Yes. All you have to do is get points by doing nothing really. You can get points for answering a poll, logging in, and watching videos. Then you can redeem them for prizes such as the iPod touch. If you want to join, message me your e-mail so that I can invite you to the site. (It is a member-only site at the moment).
Yes, but it takes so long! It's almost not worth it :(
Have you tried http://myhotprize.com? I got an watch from them (in about a week) and now I'm earning points for electronic cigarettes, lol. It's also boring but it takes a little less time :)

Cheers!
yes! Its totally free and there are lots of prizes like iPads, iMacs and loads more
All you need is an invite
