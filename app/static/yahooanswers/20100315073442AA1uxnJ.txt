ebay Warranty Question?
I live in Canada, and I am thinking of buying an iPod Touch. I have found some good deals on ebay, and a lot of which come with warranty. However, someone said that if the product is coming from the United States, the warranty won't be valid in Canada. Is that true?
I already have a good phne, Colin, but thanks for answering my question. So helpful. NOT!

Get an iphone.  Its the same thing as the Touch, but you can also call/text people.  You can get an iphone for 100$ with a two year contract.  Cant beat that.
Surely you would get a 100% correct answer, if you visited the Apple website and asked them
the warranty will be valid !
but be safe and go through paypal !!
