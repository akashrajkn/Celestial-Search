What is your opinion of the website "Omegle(dot)com"?
What do you think of it?

Do you think it is good, as people can exchange information and learn about new cultures, or do you think its a breeding ground for perverts?

Hahahaha, it's a good website.
Definitely a breeding ground for pervs, but also a lot of fun.
It's definitely a way to learn about different cultures, if you really wanted to, as well.
I think is a fun and entertaining way to pass the time that protects you from internet predators, but allows you to keep in contract with people should you chose by giving them some information, but that becomes a judgment problem, not the website
