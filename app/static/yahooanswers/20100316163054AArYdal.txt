Is Lockerz.com for real?
i currently am signed up for lockerz.com and am getting my ptz daily...i just wanted to know if getting the prizes is for real? if so, how long of a wait? and what does "more soon" mean?
Also, what is the "Guarunteed prize for___ ptz" mean???

I have gotten a ipod touche case from them. It takes a while for them to get prizes
yes lockerz is legit. i have many friends who have already bought something and i am currently saving up for a xbox 360. 3-4 weeks
More soon means that they have to restock their prizes at the next redemption(one per month). They usually have redemption around the 3rd or 4th week.Guarunteed prize for___ ptz means that you pay PTZ to have the chance before anyone else to buy whatever you want according to the PTZ amount you paid for. It is legit, however, it may take a while for your prize to get delivered. If anyone wants a Lockerz account just send an e-mail to my profile.
