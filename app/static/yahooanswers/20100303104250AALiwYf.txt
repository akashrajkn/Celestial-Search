Question about megavideo. Please help.?
Megavideo's limit is supposed to be 72 mins but sometimes after just about 10 mins the video stops and it tells me that I've reached te 72 mins limit.  Does this happen to someone else? And is there a way that I can avoid the limit?

the limit applies to all computers on your network, so if you have a family member in the house also watching megavideo that day or someone stealing your wifi, it will take away from your time limit.
I think it's intentional, so you will want to pay to watch a movie all the way through...The only way around this is to pay for the service.
