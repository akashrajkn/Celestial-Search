what is twitter?how many of u have ur account on it?plz compare it wid facebook & orkut.how do we use it?


In twitter u can find many celebrities
But i think orkut & facebook r better
Twitter is an website used by millions of people and as referred above by many celebrities. You have a box questioning "What is Happening?". People answer, sharing their thoughts, views and personal experiences. You can't write more than 140 characters at a time though. It is a good way to express yourself and see what everyone else is up to. It is not, however, like Facebook or Orkut, more like a microblog where you share whatever you feel like sharing to the world. If people enjoy what you share they'll "follow" you, this means your messages will appear on their board. You can "follow" many news websites, bands, celebrities,....
face book is of course better .
but twitter is a micro blogging site where you can post messages known as tweets of 140 character.
