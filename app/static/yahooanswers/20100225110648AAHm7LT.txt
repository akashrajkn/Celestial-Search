which choice is better for $60.00 a month, Virgin Mobile broadband 5GB or Wildblue Satellite 1.0 Mbps ?


I would go with the Virgin Mobile. Satellite service tends to be sluggish and frequently has limits and throttles.
Avoid Wildblue all you can. It severely limits you and is slower than they say. If you go over your limit ( which can happen on average use just checking emails and your Anti-Virus updating ) you will be shut off to slow-than-dial-up speeds for a week or so. Contract is expensive to get out of, too!
