Why is my firefox browser getting all weird now?
I am using Google Chrome right now, because I can't use firefox. I don't know if it's a virus or what.
but well, it first started yesterday when if I exited firefox I wasn't able to open firefox again unless I logged out and logged back in to the computer.

And like 30 minutes ago, I just noticed that the refresh, backword/foreward button do not work. They are there, but they are invisible and will not do anything when you put your mouse on it.

and NOW the URL at the top of the page is missing for everything I click on.

What does this all mean?

You could delete it. Then go to www.mozilla.com and get the latest version.  That should fix it.
try to uninstall and then again install it.
