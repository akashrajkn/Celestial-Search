i cant go to any sites and my yahoo messenger doesnt work too, how can i fix this, pls help. it says that i have possible http connection problem.
and also, my internet connection is working fine.

It may not be a IE problem. check out whether you got your connections right. Check out IP and DNS addresses. If this still continues call you Internet Service Provider.
If you cannot get to sites, how did you post this question? 

Use a different computer and try to create the problem again to test.
