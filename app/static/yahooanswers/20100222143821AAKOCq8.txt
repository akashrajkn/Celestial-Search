LimeWiere v.s. Frostwire?
Ohkay whats better between both of them? I know they both suck but wich one is faster? Is there another FREE music/video/Picture Downloader? I need one thats FAST, EASY TO USE, FREE AND has tons of files to pick from! Thnxz (:

I would use Frostwire, it's open source and you will get "Turbo speed" downloads.

If you know how to use Torrents, this is by far, the better option: I would use uTorrent as my downloader/ Seeder - utorrent.com and use Torrentz.com for your files, then use ThePirateBay.org Torrent Trackers &/or the Mininova.org, their your safest options.
