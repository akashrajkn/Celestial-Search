Will this work with my iPod/iTunes?
Let me know if this will work please.

 If I download itunes then import songs from cds and limewire to itunes and then put them on my ipod nano.

I think it will but I just want to make sure.

PS I have a windows computer... not sure if that makes a difference or not???

As long as the file format is mp3 or AAC you are all set. The following link provides a nifty list of formats that work with an iPod.
