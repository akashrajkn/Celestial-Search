Which is the best internet browser to use?
On a computer that keeps freezing and doesn't like IE? I've had Firefox for a while but it's really slowed my computer down - which is the best alternative?

GoogleChrome
Google Chrome without a doubt
Google Chrome is the fastest. I used to use IE and Safari but switched to Chrome because it was so much better. Its free to download here: http://www.google.com/chrome
Chrome, Opera, SRWare Iron, which is like Chrome, but does not send your surfing habits back to Mother Google. I personally use and like Iron...
Lots of people say Google Chrome, but Opera 10.5 is the fastest browser in the world. It also looks a lot better than most. It is also one of the most secure.
(open windows update, there is a new thing that lists them all and were to download them)

K-meleon is quite fast, firefox is good, but the addons and tools can get bloated and slow down the system, Safari is pretty good also, very fast.
Chances are that Firefox isn't the culprit for your slow PC. I believe Chrome uses more resources than Firefox, especially regarding frequency of disk access and memory use, both issues create a common performance bottleneck.  

Try Chrome by all means, but I think Firefox is your best bet.  Make sure you're running the latest version and depending on how handy you are with changing `services` in Windows you might want to visit the Black Viper website http://www.blackviper.com/ that gives tutorials on changing your Windows configuration by tweaking `services` speeding up your PC.  Failing that, add more RAM.  A cheap and easy way to improve performance.  Good luck!
Go firefox all the way. So much faster than all others without slowing down your computer!
Someone mentioned that Chrome uses more resources, but only for each tab. Each tab runs its own process,thats why you can drag tabs out to make a new window, pretty nifty feature.

Chrome for sure
Firefox.
