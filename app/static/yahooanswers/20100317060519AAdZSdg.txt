For those who have used both firefox and opera I am sure you have a default favorite, which one?
ill be very happy to see some reasons...

Dear Friend,

I prefer to Mozilla web browser. This is because, I like the interface of the Mozilla web browser, as it enables me to navigate to the menus easily by pressing the Alt (Alter) button, and use the arrow keys for the same.

i like firefox because you can tweak it's inner settings(about config), plus i love all the addons you can have on firefox.
