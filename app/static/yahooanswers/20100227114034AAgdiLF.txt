how do i search for people on twitter?
okay so i'm just trying to look someone up and like i know for a fact they have a twitter and i already know their username but when i type in their name it keeps saying that there was no matches. why is it doing that?
how can i look people up if it keeps telling me that there is no match?
thanks

The most logical reason that I can think of is that their page is probably only created. It usually takes about a month for profiles to appear on the search page. If it's a celebrity you're searching for, try googling them, it is most likely that you will get a result from doing that. If it's not, the person you're searching for should come up anyway.
Try finding out this person's username and then put it into the search box, for example
twitter.com/anon

I hope that helps! :)
