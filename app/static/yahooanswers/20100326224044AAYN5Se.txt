does anyone know alot about ebay problems?
i had bought an ipod on ebay and i had a message that said i might not get it i sent the money and he received it and i did not get it  and then i tried to talk to him but it said his account was closed and i cannot contact him what can i do

I don't know exactly where to tell you to look but eBay has buyer protection in the event that a seller doesn't deliver the goods after you pay so you should be able to easily get your money refunded. So don't fret and just look for options to report that you haven't received your merchandise. eBay should refund your money and then go after the seller to get their money back from him. 

In the future try sticking to power sellers who have at least a few hundred positive feedbacks, if not into the thousands. That way you avoid the headaches that come with this sort of problem.

I'd say the first place to look is in your account options and see if there is a feature to report a fraudulent seller.
oh snap.
