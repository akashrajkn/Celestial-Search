What's a cheap/fast internet provider?
Cox is wicked expensive!!
I'm in Arizona.

So I take it you're from Boston? 

It depends very much on what part of the state you live, if you're really in Massachusetts, but Charter, Comcast and Verizon all have service in parts of Boston and other locations in Massachusetts. 

Otherwise you need to tell us where you live, since I"m just guessing based on your stereotypical Bostonian choice of idiomatic expressions.

EDIT: Arizona is a large state. We can't tell you which ISPs are available to you without knowing your apartment number, building number, street address and city. Comcast services regions in Arizona, but I don't know if Comcast would service you, in particular, or not, nor do I know if it would be cheaper than Cox.

The only way to find out for certain if you can get service from a particular ISP or not is to call that ISP via telephone or possibly via post. An ISP may service your region and even your street, but that doesn't mean they will serve every building on that street. Therefore, it's more or less something that you have to do on your own, since most of us probably don't want to give away our street address on the Internet.
Depends on what's available in your area.  If you want to go super cheap, Net Zero does dial up for free.  I think you get about 10 hours a month and then they charge you 10 bucks.  But dial up sucks...  Look for a good DSL provider.
