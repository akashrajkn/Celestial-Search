Why is ANYONE still using that crap that is called Internet Explorer?  It is so glitchy and will never work properly.  Switch to Firefox!
You could try reinstalling Internet Explorer, but Ashley is right, mozilla firefox and google chrome are both MUCH better web browsers
Internet Explorer sucks I didn't think people still used it. Opera 10, Firefox, and Safari are so much better
