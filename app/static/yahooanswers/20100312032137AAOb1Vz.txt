what is twitter used for?
i hear it is to tell friends where you are and what you are doing but who wants to do that?

A lot of people use it to follow celebrities, to see what they are doing. I have not used it so I do not know how Twitter works, I only know what it is from reading about it.
It's a kind of microblogging. Celebrities use it for keeping their fans updated.
