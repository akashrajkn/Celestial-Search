If you are paying for fiber-optic but getting copper, how chuffed are you?


EXTREMELY CHUFFED!
To put it in perspective, copper wire can handle about 400 phone calls at the same time.  The amount of phone calls that fiber-optics can handle hasn't even come close to being used.

If you paid for fiber-optic but get copper, I'd be very upset.
Unless you have FTTH, then it will always be copper that connect you to the internet.
