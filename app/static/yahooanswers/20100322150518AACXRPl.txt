how do i know how many followers i have on formspring.me?
I hear some people say "oh I have 256 followers"or "I have 800+".I know you can't see who's following you,but how do you see how MANY people are following you?

either A. they're talking about twitter B.they are stupid or C. they are bullshitting you because you cant see whos following you.
