Work offline is always checked when I open firefox. How do I have it so it isn't checked when I open firefox?

Used to be, when  I opened up firefox my connection thingy would pop up so I could try to connect. 

This work offline being checked thing happened right after I installed the 'bloody red' theme. 

I finally got sick of it and changed my theme last night, but work offline is still checked at startup. 

I tried looking in about:config, but there isn't an toolkit.networkmanager.disable option.

do you connect to internet after opening firefox? if yes then first connect and open ff.
