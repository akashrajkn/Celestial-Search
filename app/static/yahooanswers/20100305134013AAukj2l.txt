Why does it take so long to connect to Chatroulette?
Whenever i go to chat roulette.com and press play it just says: looking for a partner, please wait. I once waited for ten minutes and nothing happened. Does this happen to everyone or only me?

This is happening to me RIGHT NOW.
Chat Roulette is fickle with connecting users sometimes. Especially at night when a lot of users are on, it's tough to connect to people.
