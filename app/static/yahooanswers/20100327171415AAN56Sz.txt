can you use clear wireless mobile on a desktop?
I want to get the Clear Wimax network but i don't want to pay extra for both the mobile and the home connection if I can just connect my mobile USB to my desktop and still be able to use the internet. Is that possible?

Yes, same exact thing. Just be careful with downloading a ton of stuff because mobile wireless providers sometimes enforce bandwidth caps.
go to BESTBUY and get a program called DATA Pilot Get the Universal Kit - Make sure it supports your phone model, it includes all of the cables and software to use your phone as a modem! I have used it for years. You can also edit your phone book and change pictures in your phones and create ring tones - it is like 79.95
