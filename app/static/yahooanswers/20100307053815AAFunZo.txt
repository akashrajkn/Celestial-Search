downloading of a lecture from internet  not allowed straight forward?
please see this site WWW.mathiit.in
this site does not allowed any lecture to download but there lecture can be viewed directly. is there is any way to download the lecture so that i can view at my convenience. that is  without using internet after downloading. i tried everything but all in vain.actually this is not a video simply a lecture with demonstration  on white board.pl suggest some simple way .

There are 3 way....
1) Go to (File2HD.com)
http://file2hd.com/Default.aspx

mark the video button and search the link. If it works then no prob. If it doesn't.... then

2) Download Ask Recorder. It can capture any video from any site. You have to watch the whole video and it'll be downloaded in the download folder and you can catch the path of the file.

3) Or you can just get the Audio by downloading Kate's Mp3 Recorder. It's easy. Not too much size.

I'm sure either of above will solve. Try it step by step.
