Do you think this is a good idea- fake internet name?
Ok, A friend of mine said that I should use a fake name on the internet like use "Aaron Smith" instead of my real name, and to use that ever where on the net, but someone else said that that might get me in trouble. What do you think?

Use a fake name, just not a real name. More like a screen name.
