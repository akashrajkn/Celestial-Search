Where does Mozila Firefox store it's auto-save passwords?
Hey guys,
i know how to access mozila firefoxes passwords by going to tools security, reveal passwords, etc...
i'm interested in where they are stored on my computer?
Can anyone help me with this?
thanks.

Your passwords are stored in two different files, both of which are required: 

key3.db - This file stores your key database for your passwords. To transfer saved passwords, you must copy this file along with the following file. 
3.5/3.6:
signons.sqlite - Saved passwords.

So...c:\documentsandsettings\youraccount\applicationdata\mozilla\firefox\profiles
