Among Meta search engines (the engines which combine search results of 2 or more search engines): Dogpile, meta crawler, excite, leap fish, web crawler...
Google and Yahoo are the main search engines, but there are other reliable search engines, here is a list of them:
1- www.altavista.com
2- www.AOL.com
3- www.alltheweb.com
4- www.teoma.com
But to get the best results, you need to enhance your query by being as specific as possibly.
The best search is www.metacrawler.com ---it searches all search engines..http://www.metacrawler.com/
