Use Computers Internet on Mobile?
I have a NOKIA 2700. Anybody please tell me how to get internet on mobile via my pc which have a broadband connection..
I mean is there any way to share it with my mobile.. There is a software GNU box for s 60but i have a java phone...

you have to go through your carrier for internet!
Internet access on your phone is provided by the phone's carrier and not the broadband connection of your pc.  They are not related.
