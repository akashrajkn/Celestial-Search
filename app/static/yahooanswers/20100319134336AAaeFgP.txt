how to turn off ebay automatic seller fees?
i just signed up for ebay automatic seller fees and then realised i didnt want it but dont know how to stop it, it isnt really a big deal because i pay my seller fees as soon as i receive the money for an item i sold but im scared that at some point i will be charged and wont know what it was for.

Click seller account

where it says auto payments click change
You may be asked to login again at this point.

When it loads click cancel and all auto payments are stopped.
