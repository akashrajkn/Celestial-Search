i am a member of this website, and every time i click on new topic, i get an error. does anyone knows how to post threads on this site that can show me how to do it? thanx

There is a Thread that clearly states...
"New users will only be able to post in existing topics, New topics can be created once new users have made 5 posts"

It is in FORUM ANNOUNCEMENTS in the FORUM INFORMATION AND FEEDBACK area.

As in.. the very first part of the forum... the Insanely Mac Lounge...   You will see that bauerj posted in that thread, and the title of that thread can be seen there.

So, you need to post 5 replies before you can start a new topic anywhere.

end of line
