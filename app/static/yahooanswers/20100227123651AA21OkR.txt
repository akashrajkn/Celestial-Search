On eBay, two sellers are selling the same item I want for the same price. Which do I choose?

I think I'll pick the first one to give the seller more feedback as the other one has nearly 11,000! Which would you pick?

Find the one with the most positive feedback and higher rankings. If there isn't any signifacant differance, it doesn't matter.
it doesn't matter who will you choose, they are for the same price and the same item.
The seller with the best feedback. If they're the same then the item ending soonest.
The seller with the best feedback. If they're the same then the item ending soonest
or the closest to your home.
The one with 100% rating. But actually not much difference in ratings, since the one has had more sales, so naturally would wind up with a few dings on their ratings.
Pick the second one. He has the most feedback. Feedback shows you which one is more highly rated by their buyers, and this seller is clearly very highly rated, whereas the first seller only has roughly 200, so less people think he is a good seller or less people have bought from him. Either way, the second is best as he is either a better, more trusted seller, or more reliable as more people have voted for him.
I would choose the one with 100% feedback but it's your choice.
The first one has 100% feedback with one neutral in a year, the second one has 99.5% feedback which seems fine but if you look closely because they sell so many thousands of items they actually have 14 negative feedbacks last month. Do you want to be number 15?  Go with the first seller. 

Always go into feedback and read it don't just look at the figures. Never buy from a seller because you think they deserve the feedback OK,  go with the one who offers the best service and has the best overall feedback.
