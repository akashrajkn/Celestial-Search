A great site that lets you download movies is thepiratebay.org. All you need is a torrent client, like uTorrent (utorrent.com)
If you want tv www.tvshack.com would do it. Even though after like an hour or two you have to start paying.
hulu.com
I actually happened to watch Zombieland online for free (and good quality) a few months ago. The site is called www.stagevu.com. It has high quality DivX videos for free (which you can download or view streaming). The link I'm providing below will take you straight to the movie ^_^
You can watch The Avatar movie online for free at:
