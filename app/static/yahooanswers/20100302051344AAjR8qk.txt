NEED FAST WEB BROWSER?
Plz advice a good looking and a high speed web browser !!

google chrome
opera 10
safari 4
firefox 3.6
i think google chrome is the best.it is very fast web browser.

next comes firefox 3.6,
google chrome is the fastest browser
acc to stats apple safari is in best performance but if u want security and features go for firefox which is also good in speed
if u use only orkut and social networking opt for google chrome (also considered fast)
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or IE 8.
I use a dial-up connection.  8 kb/s is normal speed which is available to me.  It is heaven for me when sometimes it goes to 40 kb/s..
I needed a fast browser - searched around - now I swear by K-Meleon.  Nothing else for me.
Google Chrome is very fast web browser compare to other web browser
Google Chrome
Opera 10
Mozilla Firefox
Internet Explorer 8
google chrome is best 
followed by firefox and internet explorer
