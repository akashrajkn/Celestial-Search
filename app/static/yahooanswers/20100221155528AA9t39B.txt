How can you tell how many websites you have signed up on with your E-Mail?
Wanna know, cause, I wanna keep track of what sites Im on.

Sorry, but there is no way of knowing...
Check your history? haha, there really is no way.
You could save the confirmation emails , put them in a folder on your email program.. ~
