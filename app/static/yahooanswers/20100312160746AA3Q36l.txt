Help!!! Someone's using my email address...?
I checked my inbox today for the first time and found 50 emails from MyYearbook and formspring. The problem is, I don't and never had an account with either of these sites. I was wanting to know if my brother or sister was using my email to create one so decided to check it out. A guy (I'm a girl) that is my age and has the same last name as me from across the country is the actual culprit. It's quite possible that he mistyped his own address as these were the only emails that I had directed to him and my password has not been changed. However, I don't want someone using my address. I searched the Help topics on both sites and found nothing. 
My question is, what can I do about this?! Thanks so much.

hmm well first i would delete your account and make a new one or change your password.......
well if you know them tell them to stop and if you dont leave posts sayin you better stop and stuff like that i hope this helps ive never been a big help i hope i was for you
First, if your friends {contacts} on your email use Myyearbook or Formspring they could be trying to get you to join. 

Next, go to Myyearbook.com and click on the forgot password and type in your email address. See if there is an account with your email address.
Do the same for Formspring.
