Looking for a free domain registry and hosting site.?
I want my own domain name (that means no extensions past .com) and a host that's free. I know there are definitely going to repercussions to this. I don't mind them advertising on my site (as long as there isn't video advertisement), or their being the 'owners' of it either. It's just a simple little picture site so I don't need much storage space either. 

It's probably extremely hard to find a host like this these days, but if you know one thanks for the help.

hi,
 i currently have 2 of my sites hosted with http://www.tucktail.com/ which is indeed a free hosting 
and the best part is it offers 24X7 support

You can try that link but I would suggest that you go with a paid host that offers a free domain because you won't find that with free hosts unless you get their sub-domain and then have the URL redirected.

I can give you three sites that can help you with that.

For low cost hosting that offers a free 1 year domain

For free web hosting

To redirect the sub-domain that you get from free web hosting
