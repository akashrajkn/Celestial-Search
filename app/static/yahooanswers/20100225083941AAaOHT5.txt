how many seconds should i wait before sniping on ebay?
yesterday someone sniped me on something i really wanted!T_T so today i signed up with the website AuctionSniper. There is a place for how many seconds you want the program to snipe at. the website says it recommends 5 seconds. but yesterday the other person did it at like 2 seconds. so how many seconds should i set it at to avoid being out-sniped by another sniper? the thing i want closes tomorrow and i REALLY want it!! hopefully i will be the only sniper though!!

1 second? Wouldn't that be the best option. Don't give anyone else a chance to snipe.
i do it at 7 seconds, because i can't trust my internet to be quick enough if i go for any less. If your internet is fast enough go for less though.
To be honest, it really depends on the speed of your computer, and your internet connection. If you have a faster computer and internet, then naturally you can afford to leave it later. If you have a new computer, with Windows 7 or vista or mac or linux equivalent, then about 10-5 seconds is advisable. It is unlikely for someone to beat your bid with less than 10 seconds, unless they preempt the snipe and bid higher, which is unlikely. If your computer is slower, then about 20 seconds is advisable.
Hope this helps
