What are some good subjects to blog about?
I'm a teenage girl (17). Be detailed with your answers! The more subjects you list for me to blog about the better!! :)
I need some suggestions though. A subject to get me started.

ME.
food and travel gets a lot of attention, but the best subject for you to blog about is a subject you know really well, readers kind of get the feeling that the writer is not an expert on the subject and moves on.
You can blog about movie reviews.It's a topic that can attract a good base for your blog.
