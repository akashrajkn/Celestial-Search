My own wife appears in the current Bank of America commercial but I'm in London so I can't see it
there are many websites out there they display this shows online but i could reckonment using a IP router so that it appears ur in the us but ur not but i casues extremly slow internet u can get free ones that can be switched off when ur not watching them but if you want more details let me know i do this alot my self
