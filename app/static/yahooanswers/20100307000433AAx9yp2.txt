Do you know any websites for my daughter?
She is 15 years old, and she has nothing to do but facebook, myspace, and yahoo. She use to play stuff like clubpenguin and stardoll but she wants something her age. She also knew ourworld and wiworld and stuff like that but just cant find the right website! (hates webkinz)
