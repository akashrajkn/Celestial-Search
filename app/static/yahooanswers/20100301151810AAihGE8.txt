free website to look up phone numbers?
I'm trying to look up someone's phone number...i've tried a few websites and her name is coming up but for her personal info i have to pay. i know there is a 100% free website because i've used one in the past but right now i can't find one. do you know of a free website to find phone numbers at? thank you
have tried all of those...they want u to pay for the phone number..

reverse lookup in white pages?
phonenumber.com?

those are the ones i know off hand...
it depends on what country you live in
in the US, www.anywho.com is one of them
