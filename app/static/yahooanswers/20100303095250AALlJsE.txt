Where can you download the latest Netscape browser ?


Here you go
http://download-netscapebrowser.tk/
The actual Netscape browser page can be found at http://browser.netscape.com/

Please note that Netscape is no longer supported as a browser, as version 9.0.0.6 was released in February 2008. You can still download this by clicking on the "Releases Page" link above. Version 9 was based on Firefox though, so using Firefox or Flock will give you much of the behavior that the old Netscape had.

The successor to the Netscape that had the browser, email, and webpage creator all in one would be Seamonkey, as seen at http://www.seamonkey-project.org/
