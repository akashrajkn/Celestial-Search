What did Rupert Murdoch mean when he said the current days of internet are over?
The basic belief is that once they control the ISP's then they can start charging every time you visit a site, and also censoring out all the small time bloggers etc that have been stealing content from the major news media. Is this what he's talking about? He said it could start in twelve months or so.

How does it work and how's the internet going to operate once they've protected their interests by screwing everyone they don't own already?

Any knowledge of this???

Murdoch owns several newspapers. I think he's trying to discredit the internet because it is bringing traditional newspapers to an end.
Instead of someone getting news for free you may have to pay for it
