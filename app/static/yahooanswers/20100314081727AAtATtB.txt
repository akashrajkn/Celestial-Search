Do I need an ISP for wireless?
I have a desktop computer.  I currently have a dial-up (Netzero) ISP.  What exactly is wireless, how does it work and do I need ANY ISP to connect to the Internet?
I know this question has been answered for laptops and for cable connections but I don't have either one.   I'd like to do away with dial-up but my budget doesn't include cable of any kind.   Can you just buy a router and do a one time shot kind of thing?   Sorry, I'm really technically challenged.

you can not go wireless on dial up due to dial up is the slowest connection and the do not make wire routers for diaal up
yes
