how do you know if you have Wifi?
i don't know if my computer has Wifi or not how do i find out?

Control Panel -> Networking -> Change adapter settings

If you don't see a "Wireless" description, you don't have a wifi adapter in your computer.
Most desktops don't.
The vast majority of laptops do.
Wifi = wireless internet, so if you want connect to the internet without any cables, you probably have wifi.
