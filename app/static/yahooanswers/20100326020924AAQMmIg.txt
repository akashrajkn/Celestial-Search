Can someone tell me a TV tuner is?
Windows 7 has a Media Center that allows one to watch TV. Does it require a TV Tuner? And, what is a TV Tuner anyway?

Yes it requires a TV Tuner. 

A TV tuner card is a computer component that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk.
A TV Turner is a adapter that you can install on your computer that will allow you to watch TV. These can be internal (for Desktop) or a USB for laptops. You install them, connect your cable to it and you can watch and record TV right on your computer.

On a laptop you can also connect a small Antenna to it to pick up Digital signals if you cannot connect to a cable.

Make sure that if you buy one that you get a digital one not an analog, since they no longer broadcast in analog.

Heres is an example of a USB Turner for a laptop. You can also use it on a Desktop.
