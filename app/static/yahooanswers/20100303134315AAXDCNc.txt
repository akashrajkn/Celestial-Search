Why does Paypal deduct four extra dollars for each payment you make?


It's not always $4. They take a percentage of your total as a "service fee"
I think, they dont. They only charge sellers NOT the buyers. or may be the card you have connected with paypal charges you the $4 for every transaction so paypal is charging this amount on the card company's behalf.
Paypal takes a percentage of whatever you pay because they are charging you to use thier technology.

I thought it was for Fees or Converting in to USD fees, It's maybe fees for using the service.
"Paying" things with Paypal should be free.  They want to encourage people to use it to Buy stuff.

They only take the service fee only when you "Sell" something - ie: recieve a payment.  So if you are selling on eBay, it might be wise to know their fees so you can account for that in the price of the item you are selling.
