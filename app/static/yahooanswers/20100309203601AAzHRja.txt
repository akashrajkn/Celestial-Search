What are some good websites?
I only use 4 or 5 websites regularly and I'm looking to broaden my horizons.  If you know any particularly useful, interesting, or funny sites please post some links.

www.reddit.com. Reddit is a website where people submit links to other websites, pictures, news articles, anything. The submitted links are then upvoted or downvoted by users, and the top links show up on the front page.

It's a great place to find funny, or interesting, stuff, and to find other websites.
I have the perfect thing for you:
