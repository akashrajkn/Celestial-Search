Are there any email websites where you can create an unlimited amount of new email addresses per day?
Sorry if this seems like a strange question, it's just that on hotmail you can only make about 5 a day and some other websites only about 3. Are there any email websites where you can make an unlimited amount of email addresses per day? 
P.S. I'm not a spammer, if I told you the real reason you wouldn't believe me.
Ok, the truth is that there is a website called lockerz and you can get points from it if you invite more people to it (which you can later redeem for prizes). So... the point is that if I made 1000 email addresses and invited them all, and accepted them all I would get 4000 points, which is enough for (e.g.) an apple mac, which could replace this terrible 4 year old Acer that I'm using right now. I know, I have no life, but what can I say? I'm bored as hell when I come home from school, stare at a wall for 6 hours, have dinner and go to bed. That's basically my life story.
