Does anyone know where I can see the latest Lost episode?
I've tried a couple of sites but they all have these never ending surveys before you canb watch it - so does anyone know where I can find a good quality site?

Its in its early days but it looks incredible from what I've seen. And NO surveys
I only found it last night but they have the whole of season 6 including episode 8!!
and its pretty impressive quality.
Looks like they will also have House MD, SKins and Big Bang theory if your interestd
