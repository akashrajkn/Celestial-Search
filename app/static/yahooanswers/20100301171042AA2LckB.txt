Help with tv commercial?
I was watching tv and i stumbled upon this infommercial about ppl bidding for stuff (somewhat like ebay) but you can end up with it really cheap! what is the website called?


i know for a fact that it ends with Bee

bumblebee auction? It's a UK Police auction site. It's "cheap stuff" because it's police confiscated and could be damaged with no warranty or repairs.

It's sort of like Propertyroom.com located in the U.S


Course I could be wrong

Could not find any ending with Bee. You could try googling "tv commercial auction" and put the name of the tv channel you saw it on in there.
