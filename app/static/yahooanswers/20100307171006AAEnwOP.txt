AIM video chat keeps getting disconnected?
I go on video chat with my friend and i dont have a webcam, though, But we always seem to disconnect by itself. When i do this with my other friends, it doesnt disconnect by itself. Could it be my account, or what?

Try Tokbox.com, just a suggestion. It can't be your account but it's probably of a bad connection.
