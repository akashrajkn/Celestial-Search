AOL Mail says invalid user or password even though I signed in this morning just fine with the SAME password?
Title says it all; it's frustrating because that email account had everything in it, including important contacts and emails. And it's definitely the right password because it's been the same for YEARS, too. I've tried everything... 
~~~ Is there a number I can call to get AOL to reset my password? ~~~
Because the password reset questions are from years ago and I cannot remember them...
OKAY I tried calling AOL support to reset my password, but I don't have the billing info or zip code since I've had this account since I was about 6 years old. HOW TO RESET ?!?
I definitely didn't type it in wrong or hit caps, btw

Maybe you mistyped it or accidentally hit CAPS LOCK? ..
