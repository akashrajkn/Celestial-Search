deviantART April Fool's Day joke?
Who else was totally fooled by the avatar/signature change by deviantART, and what was your avatar/signature changed to?

My friend told me about it at school and how it was an April Fools' joke, lol. So much for the element of surprise.
I got Team Seeker :U At least I didn't get a Twilight icon.
