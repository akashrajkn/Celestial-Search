Use System Restore and reset your computer to a checkpoint before you pressed the button.
View - Toolbars

Then make sure "navigation toolbar is checked".
Towards the top of your page, just under the titlebar (contains the X button), right click.  You'll get a menu with "Navigation Toolbar".   Click on it so that there is a check in front of it and it will re-appear.
