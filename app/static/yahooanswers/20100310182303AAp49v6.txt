Chatango shut down? Is this really true?
Heard chatango shut down, its not working D:
Will it be back up? Or is it really shutting down?
I heard this happened in the past, so if you were there for that, how long did it stay off for?
@Jessica, I heard its a scam, it wont even show up on google search.

@Wendy, same hurr D:

I just heard today(even though others have heard from a much longer time ago) that they have/are shutting down and have moved the Chattanga, but I'm not really sure. Chattanga's connection seems to be bad right now, so its hard to know.
idk...i hope it's still up. jeez what a bummer. im gonna pray to god it comes back up o.o'
