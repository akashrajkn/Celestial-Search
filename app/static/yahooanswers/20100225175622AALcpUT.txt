What is Ihatejade.com and stuff like that?
Okay so sometimes I just see someone randomly email me and tell me to go to that website and I never know what it is so I don't click it. Sometimes its like Ihatenatalie and other girl names. So what is that website?

Probably a page where a guy has nude pictures/videos of his ex-girlfriend. There's a link on the page that you send to your friends, and when they click the link, you get to see more naked pics.
It's supposedly "ex's" or just some random girl spreading a girl's naked pictures around the web because "that girl" did something the "ex" didn't like. In reality, it's just a bunch of spammers.
What they said.
Do NOT click it. They're all direct sources to getting a virus. Think about the REAL reason they want you to re post the link. It's just a big hoax.
