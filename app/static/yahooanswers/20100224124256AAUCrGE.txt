Jeopardy mentioned 4chan? Safe to go there?
I was browsing youtube today and aw that one of the videos being watched was about 4chan being mentioned on jeopardy. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7BiaTz_6gI )

I had heard of 4chan before but it was always bad things. If it got onto jeopardy it cant be that bad, is it safe to go there?

4chan is an anonymous image board.  Lots of perverted stuff there.  So if you don't mind the pervserion yes it is safe to visit as long as you don't download anything...
Avoid /b/.
You could accidentally look at pictures that would make you a criminal.
