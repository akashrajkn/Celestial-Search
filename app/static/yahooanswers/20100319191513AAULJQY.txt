whats a website where you type out sentences and have robots read them?
Like a website for robots. Like pretend you type, "Hi, My name is Leah." & you click say or whatever, and the robot says it.

I need a website

Uhhh, well Google Translate has something like that...

http://translate.google.com/?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&tab=wT#en|en|%0A

Go to that link and type in whatever you want! Then you should see a speaker symbol. Also, as you type, the words will appear below the type box, that's where the speaker symbol is. Just click that and you're good to go.
