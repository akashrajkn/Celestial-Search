Why can't I redeem my amazon gift cards from swagbucks?
Well, on the amazon gift card part of the swagbucks website, it says you can redeem amazon gift cards on the 1st and the 17th. Well I logged in today, and I cannot redeem/get the code for these gift cards. Anyone know why?

And you thought Swagbucks was legitimate?
They're sometimes late with these cards. They have so many orders to process. I just got mine!!!

Good Luck!
Give it time, they will come. I've received all of the amazon gift cards Ive redeemed so far.
