I'm looking for a new forum. Any ideas?
I've been posting on a website that just lost a lot of their community over tyrannical moderators and a butthurt community manager. I'm looking for a forum that has lax rules, a nontopic board, but still gets a moderate amount of traffic. I dont want to get banned for dropping a f-bomb. I'm fine with a tough community that doesn't like newcomers, i know how that works. I also am a gamer, so I'd prefer a gaming community. Oh, and one more thing, IGN can stuff it.

Craigslist has a bunch of Forums and a Gaming Forum...
