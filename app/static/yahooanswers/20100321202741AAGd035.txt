on chat roulette i cant hear the other person help?
I have a dell studio 7 laptop and the boxe to recieve sound is checked

some people mute sound on chat roulette. If you see that the audio is enabled on the other persons cam, then maybe it is a problem with the dell laptop.  another site like chat roulette is chat hopper.com try it on that site and see if u can hear the other person. it may be chat roulettes fault. that site is very laggy and crashes on me after only being on a few minutes. I will be in the middle of a chat with someone and it just freezes on me. too many people are on it I think and the servers can't handle it. u don't want on that site anyway. its mostly men masterbating it seems like. if your wanting to just do webcam chat try justin.tv  ustream.tv  blogtv.com  u can co host on them. well Im not sure about justin.tv but u can on the other ones
