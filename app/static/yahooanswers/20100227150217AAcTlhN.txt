Downloading Torrent Problem, Please Help.?
Okay so I downloaded The Sims 1 torrent file for my MAC. I launched the icon in the folder after it downloaded and I'm only getting a "please insert CD disk to start the game", obv. I don't have the disk sine I downloaded the game off the internet, now what do I do? With games I download from torrent files it always sates that I need the disk. 

Can anyone please help me?

Hello,

The torrent is probably for the Windows operating system only, you'll have to find one for a Mac; by the way you're not supposed to be asking about illegal things like this on Yahoo! Answers.
