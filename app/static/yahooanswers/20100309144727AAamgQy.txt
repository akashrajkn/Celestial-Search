Email Virus... Help please!?
I opened an email and after opening it i released it was a virus. It was an email about a new iphone. That is all i read before closing my hotmail account. Im guessing its a virus... what will it do to my system? How do i get clear it from my system... please help!

Oh... by the way... i do know the sender... thats the only reason i opened the email!

Run a anti-virus scan on the computer, and change your email password and any other site that uses that password ... like now.
a worm actually attachs itself to an adress book then you receive an email from someone u know and trust it and open it and there u get a virus.

AS LONG AS YOU ARE ON WINDOWS viruses trojan horses worms spyware will be a FACT OF LIFE if you want to be free of virus consider a beautiful mac will not be your last time with viruses

in the meantime REINSTALL WINDOWS AND REFORMAT hard drive running an antivirus wont do any good now because the registry has been damaged

GOOD LUK
