Not bad. You could make your blog more attractive by using some different templates. Also you could add some widgets to your blog. Make a google search to find more about blogging tips and tricks. You could also get some nice templates for Free. Some websites I refered were: bloggertipsandtricks.com,  bloggertricks.com
