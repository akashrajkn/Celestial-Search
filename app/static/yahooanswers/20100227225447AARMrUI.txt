How exactly does Lockerz work?
so i know that you have to get points by watching videos and then u use points when there is a redemption period. but to get into the redemption period, do u pay more points? and do u actually have to BID on points, and is there a chance u won't get ur prize?

You don't have to pay more pointz to get into the redemption time unless you choose to participate in the member redemption. The Member Redemption simply increases your chances of receiving the prize you want.

I'm not sure what you're asking here, but no, you don't have to bid on pointz.

Yes, there is a chance you won't get the prize you want because there is a limited stock of items at Lockerz.
