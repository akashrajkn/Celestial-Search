If you deactivate your formspring, can they still see your name?
say you ask a question and accidentally forget to put anonymous, when you intended to.
if you deactivate your account, does your name still show if they haven't answered the question yet?

Unfortunately,
The same thing happened to me.
You might have to just tough it out,
I haven't found a solution yet.
Good luck, love.
