How do you use the internet?

I don't know how to use the internet.

Very carefully.
www.google.com
click click click spam click virus click p*rn click alt+f4

click shut down
Go to getfirefox.com

That is the proper way to use the Internet.
I think you should be more clear on that. Internet can be used in many ways. Like Firefox or Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer need to connect to the internet in order for you to be viewing this page. You also need to use the internet for other programs like Online Games or programs that only run with internet.
go to google and look up what cookies and cream icecream you should buy! lolz
