It is when your computer is slowing down. Your mouse will drag, your computer might start working, your cpu/ram might go into the high percent usage.
Sometimes a website might lag, and it might take several minutes to connect to it even if you have a high speed internet connection.
Lag is a term used on computers when your internet connection is slow. Its also used when your tired (like jet lag) or if your having trouble doing something or are behind on it
Easiest way to explain...  Let's say you're typing something in a chatroom and you press enter, then it takes 10 seconds longer that it should.  That's 10 seconds lag.  "I'm lagging" / "I've got some killer lag" / "I am laggerrific!" means they are experiencing this.
it means the internet or web-page/game is delaying. 
like when you click or move the mouse and it doesn't move for a few seconds.

it just takes time for your computer to communicate with the servers and return the information (keystroke or mouse movement) to you.
It's in the dictionary:  "fall or stay behind"  ...if you went you running with a friend and she was slow, you could say she was lagging.

Used in terms of computer lingo, it means their computer or internet is slow.  So maybe they're getting your messages late or the screen is freezing.
Like sdouble said.

Also, people might say they have a high ping.

High ping = bad = lag
Low ping = good
