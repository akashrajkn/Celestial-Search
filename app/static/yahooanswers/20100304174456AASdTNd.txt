Trojans. Lots of them.
Faux pornography. People are linking you because they're depraved and want to see pictures of this "ex-girlfriend" naked. It's basically a pyramid scheme, but with porn. Oh, and viruses. Lots of those.
i think its a porno site.
no idea, but I'm not clicking on it. I googled it and this is the results:

http://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&source=hp&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.screwyouamy.com&meta=&aq=f&oq=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.screwyouamy.com&fp=6838ece949dd203d
Sound like pornography or some other kind of bs, whatever it is, my browser says the link is broken...
The site has poor reputation! It can be a scam, attack site or something else like that.
