My internet browsers do not connect to the internet when I connect my laptop through wifi...what should I do?
It says I have a strong wireless connection. Works fine when I connect through wires though. By the way I am using xp.

OK this could be a number of things.

Go to network settings and disable the firewall for the wireless connection.

Check your wireless router for a MAC Authentication button, your laptop might be connected to the router but not authenticated.

Check your browsers 'proxy' settings, they may be tied to an address in the wired range of yor router.
