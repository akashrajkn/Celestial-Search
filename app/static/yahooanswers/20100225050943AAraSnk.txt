anyone who has worked for livejasmin?
I am considering becoming a performer for livejasmin.com but I am not sure my real name and ID info will be safe.Also I wanna know more about working for them.Can anyone share some experience?

you'll get perverted people on there. Very perverted & harrasive.

Although you get funny people like me who once went on and was being really random and cheered the person up :)
I used to work for livejasmin.com as an agent until I found out that they ripped me off. Livejasmin.com has a bad reputation for scamming people and also placing viruses on peoples computers. 

If you would like an experienced agent to help you become a performer then feel free to contact me: modelingrecruitment@yahoo.com

Anyone can contact me if their interested in the webcam business.
Ive been a member for 2 months & can tell you the girls who get the most privates are the ones who 'show' some skin in free chat & some nudity (slutty & very active). You must also have a good looking background, one in which you can perform without interuptions or limitations & able to do all positions
