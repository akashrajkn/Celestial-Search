Why do random people on myYearbook give you gifts?
I receive a lot of gifts and stuff from people on myYearbook that I don't know at all, and I almost never go on that site anymore (and even when I was "active" I barely went on). Is it, like, a dating site or something and people try to "flirt" with you or something? I don't know at all.

Your friends probably have VIP Membership on Myyearbook which means that when that person sends things out they go to you also. If you don't ever want to get on Myyearbook again just delete your account.
