What is free stuff???
Q1: What is a software or program that edits videos & spoof them up that I can download that is FREE?

Q2: And also, how are these people on youtube play songs in the background & don't get reported for copying the owners music? If I use a song from a CD, is the also wrong?

1: windows movie maker, its pre included in windows

2: youtube cant possibly go through all the millions of videos and root out who has music in their backround, besides alot of bands on youtube put their music on youtube for free, and when you are uploading your video you can choose to put it in.
