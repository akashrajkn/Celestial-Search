You could try looking it up on www.ovguide.com or google "watch The Pacific miniseries." :)
You can go to the website for the channel that broadcasts it - a lot of them let you watch episodes online for free.
Or you can try hulu.com.
You can watch it online at a site like http://www.watchtp.com/
http://www.megavideo.com/?d=7HX7JEBC exact link
Try Casttv.com.  They let you watch full T.V. shows for free.  Unfortunately you can only have like 3 hours a day but whatever.
