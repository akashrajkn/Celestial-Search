Trouble connecting to my two most frequented websites?
I used to go to notdoppler.com and kickasstorrents.com ALL the time. But as of recently when i try to go there it says that a connection to there servers can not be made?? I thought the sites might be down at first but I've been to BOTH on other computers since then. I can not find anywhere where anything has block either of them. I have no clue what happened... Any idea what to do??

Clear the cache of the browser your in and see if that helps. It always does for me whenever my sites feel slow.

You could also try opening command prompt and typing in "ipconfig /flushdns" without quotes. Worth a shot.
I have no idea dude. But notdoppler.com is a cool web site. I went to it to see if it would work on my comp. to make sure it wasn't a downed server, and it wasn't. It works fine on my comp, and I like it, so I think I'll get back to it.
