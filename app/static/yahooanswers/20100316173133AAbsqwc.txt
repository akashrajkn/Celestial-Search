How many blogs should be your limit?
I have multiple sides and different hobbies, and I've been making blogs for them.. I'm just wondering, what should be my limit? I'm sure I could keep up with them, but I am just not sure. Please help!! I already have 4 different blogs on the same website, and was thinking of making more.. When should I stop?

I dont think you will stop, but you will get kinda tired of posting things in more than 2 blogs.
If you can keep up, the sky's the limit, though the most I've ever seen anyone run is five.  (I have three.)
