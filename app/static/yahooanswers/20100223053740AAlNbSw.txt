Is it legal for me to post a 30-second clip of two mixed copyrighted songs online? (Not for profit)?
I was listening to one song, and realized it sounded just like another song. I opened up Audacity, and mixed the two songs together and the result was interesting. I'd like to show at least part of the result to a few people online, like 30 seconds of it, is this legal? Both songs are copyrighted and I am obviously not going to charge for this.
