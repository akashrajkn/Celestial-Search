Changing address on PayPal (10 points)?
I am trying, unsucessfully, to edit my address on PayPal. Whenever I try to edit it, all it does is add a new address right above the old one, and it gives the message "(!) To make a change to your address, please select the address you'd like to update and click the "Edit" button below.". Every time I try editing it, it gives this same stupid answer.

I'm thinking it has something to do with the old address being linked to my bank card or something, but I have already updated my address with the bank. Do I just have to wait a few days and then try again? Am I doing something wrong?

10 points to the person who solves my frustration! :-D

Can you delete all the other addresses you have added (including your previous address) and just leave the one you want on there as your primary address?  If this doesn't work just ring them, their contact number is on the help pages, I've rung them a few times, very helpful usually.
