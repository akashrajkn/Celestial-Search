Can someone help answer this for me?
I made this wish list with amazon more of a shopping list of things I want and all of sudden people are buying me things. I know it's random strangers because i didn't tell anyone that I made one. They are buying expensive things....it's so crazy. For example, someone bought me an item that was 3,000. I told my friend about it so she made one and someone bought her some expensive perfume and another item that is over 100 dollars.... I was wondering if people get that too and if I should close out my wish list

No, that's never happened to me. 

Are you, by any chance, the daughter of a mafia boss? That would explain it.
