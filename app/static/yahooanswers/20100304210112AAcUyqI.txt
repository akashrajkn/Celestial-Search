Is there any way to tell if someone is online in Yahoo Messenger even though they appear to be invisible?

I'm not a stalker okay, I just want to know if my group mates are online since we need some work done and they might just be slacking off.

No. And that question has 'creepy stalker' written all over it.
Not that i know of.
