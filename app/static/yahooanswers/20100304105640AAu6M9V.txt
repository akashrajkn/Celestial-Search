what does it&apos;s mean or any of the other ones?
and why do people type it all crazy usually i can figure it out but i just want to know whats the point?? I see it all the time and if you are knowledgable about twitter what is the pound sign in front of words for? to help people find them?? and follow me i have only one Greenfaerie_420 is my user name

&apos; is html code for an apostrophe. it's means "it is", and its is the possessive form of it.
I don't use twitter, so I don't know what they use the pound sign for.
