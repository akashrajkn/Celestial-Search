amazon.com help any help would be helpful lol?
alright so i'm kinda new to amazon but when you buy stuff from diffrent people at the same time do will all the stuff i bought come at the same time in a big box or how does that work

If it is different people, it is different shipments.  So, you'll get multiple packages.
if they come from different companies they will be shipped seperatley and sometimes you have to pay shipping for all  items not from one company.
like if you ordered sunglasses, boots and a bathing suit from three different companies you would have to pay seperate shipping per each thing. 
all amazon does is connect you and another website to find what you are looking for. 
its baiscally the same thing as ordering them from 3 different websites.
goodlucckkk
You will get multiple packages and u will get them on the same day i think
If you buy items from different sellers, there is no guarantee that they will all be delivered on the same day.  And no, they will not ship together.  You are purchasing them from people in different locations - they ship separately...
