What should I do? Ebay question need help?
Hey I bought something for my dad for his birthday on ebay. I talked to the seller and planned on paying with a money order. It has been over a week since I won the item and I have sent him several emails and have not received a response. His birthday is approaching and I'm not sure what to do. Is there a certain period in which the seller must give you the info to pay? I'm thinking of ordering one from someone else but what would happen with the one I already ordered? Could it be canceled or something since he never contacted me? I am also beginning to wonder if it would even be safe to send him a money order since he has not even responded to me yet. What do you suggest I do?

Report him to ebay and ask about a cancellation, then buy from some one else.
