I re downloaded and cleared all my cache and cookies and still can't get into zwinky help?!?!?
I wasn't able to get into zwinky all yesterday but I figured it was just bad internet connection. I went to my main connection and was still not able to get in. I uninstalled it and re downloaded it and cleared all my cache and cookies and still cant get it going past trying to sign in. Help?!?!
I know some of my other friends are able to get on also

Maybe the server is having trouble, in which case all you can do is wait.

They don't seem to have a separate status server (which usually inform visitors of downtime), so it's anyone's guess as to what is going on.
have yuh talked to Zwinky SUPPORT yet? Email them!!! I have had the same problem...Have you tried turning your computer on and off? My guess is that your downloading from the wrong site. I mean it LOOKS like the real Zwinky, but it's not. I don't know if it'll work, but you can try.
1. Uninstall it.
2. Search in Google: Zwinky
3. You will see the options, DO NOT CLICK ON THIS ONE:
Zwinky

Zwinky Home Page

More results from zwinky.com ?

As you can see it has www.zwinky.com/ instead of www.Zwinky.com You are understand? xD
So go to the one ABOVE that, (the on in the yellowy sort of rectangle.) Looks like this:

www.Zwinky.com      Create your own Zwinky - Now! Explore the world of Zwinktopia.

You might wanna check your computer for malware or a trojan! OR A WOOOORM, (viruses) If you have download from www.zwinky.com/ kay? And just to be sure have a scan after downloading.

When I downloaded from there (www.zwinky.com/) my Antivira came up nd said MALWARE
DETECTED, So beware from       THIS^^^. D:
Mkay? Still doesn't work, go to support and email them. You also might not have enough space on yer disk, so go to START then Control Panel then Add Or Remove Progams then just make a bit of space. HOPE THIS HEEEEELPED>>>>.<<<< Dx
