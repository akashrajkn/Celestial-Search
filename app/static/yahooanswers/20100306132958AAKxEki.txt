What does "stand alone manner" mean?
I found this on a site offering free to use photos:
"You are allowed to copy, distribute, transmit the work and to adapt the work. Attribution is not required. You are prohibited from using this work in a stand alone manner."

What does this mean -You are prohibited from using this work in a stand alone manner.

In what case is it prohibited to use the photos? 

The additional license says:
"Stand alone basis ¡ª You can not sell, license, sublicense, rent, transfer or distribute this image exactly as it is without alteration."

Does this mean  you can crop the photo and then it is OK to use it?

I need to use it for a site.

I need serious answers, please. In case I get a serious professional answer I will give it points.

You'll need to make the photo part of something else.  Crop it, draw a frame around it, do something to it.  Give credit for where you got it, even though the source does not require it.  That's just good etiquette. What they don't want you doing is using that photo just on its own, like printing it out and selling it.  Use it to decorate something else, and you're fine.  It becomes a part of what you're making.  Use the photo on your website.  That way, it's a part of the site.
