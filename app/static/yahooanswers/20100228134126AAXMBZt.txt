Is Twitter free to your phone?
I have TracFone, it's pre-paid so there is no way to bill it or charge anything. Can I still use Twitter?

Yes you should be able to. Just activate your phone with twitter and you can use it for free. You have to be able to text though.
If it came with a plan or something that said free twitter acces, yes. otherwise have fun refilling your credit!
Absolutly you can use it free............
:)
