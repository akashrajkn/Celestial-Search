Where can I create a forum with liberal censorship policies?
I spent a considerable time creating a completely inoffensive forum on xobor.com for a group I run and just when it was getting established I found that xobor had deleted it, presumably because in one of the posts there was a joking reference to pornography - not a link - just the word 'porn'. This really gets on my nerves

So does anyone know of a website where I can start a free forum, with the freedom to make it look the way I want - uploading own backgrounds, html banner etc., but also one that allows users to say more or less whatever they want?

This being the internet, I shouldn't really have to ask - I thought this was the last remaining 'pirate utopia' so to speak - but there we go. Censors 1, us 0.

You should ask Xobor why they deleted your forum.  It is unlikely to be for the reason you cite.  I am several music forums - membership predominately male - and there is often passing reference to porn, although the members are basically respectable middle aged males
Based on the boards I've seen hosted there, proboards.com seems reasonable in terms of censorship, but I can't comment on the ease of customization since I only used it as a regular member, not an admin.
