First you have to be a member.  Go to the black Puffle Rescue game. Get the black puffle.  Wait on the square. When you see the squid-thingy follow him. Go on the small bubbles from time to time. Don't drown.  Don't go to far away from the squid or ahead off the tenticles (idk if i spelled it rite) When you make it to the land go on to the blue steps one by one. Then go in the stair/door and your there.
