But don't expect to get rich of of it.
If you are 18 or over, I highly suggest this site. Don't trust the majority of spammers on Yahoo Answers. I take surveys every single day and I am a credible source (check how long I've been on Yahoo answers for). Opinionoutpost pays about $8.00 an hour which isn't bad considering you get to listen to music when you are taking surveys. They send you about 3 surveys a day (10-20 minutes each). This is the highest paid survey site I am currently on. Feel free to email me with any questions about this site. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone 18 or older. An extra $8.00 a day with an hours with of work relaxing at home aint bad.
