How do I put my localhost online?
I have a domain name, Is there some way I can transfer the localhost files to my domain name? is there some way i can connect my localhost to my domain?
I Use XAMPP Control Panel with Apache and MySQL sevices.

Yes there is.

Basicly you have to do 3 things: 
1. Let apache allow outside IP-adresses (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_access.html)
2. Link your domain name to your computer IP-adress. (Change the DNS of your mod to your IP, or, if you only have a domain name, and you need an nameserver to redirect to your computer, make one here: http://freedns.afraid.org/)
3. If using a router, set portforwarding for port 80 to your innernetwork IP-adres (often 192.168.x.x). (http://portforward.com/)

Here is a tutorial video, didn't watch it till the end, but the audio quality is kind off crappy.
