Once I sell my domain in an auction how do I get it to the buyer?  Do I just transfer it?
I bought a couple of domains with google domains I no longer need, but they are worth more than just deciding to not renew them.  I'd like to sell them and I have found auctions.  I would like to know what to do before hand so I don't run into troubles after someone buys it.

That website you sell your domain www.godaddy.com.
I would like to suggest you one site. that is http://www.thecreativeit.com, They are giving exclusive service of Domain Auction. I come across this site through Yahoo.com and suggested one of my friend. He is very happy and satisfy with that service. so i would to suggest you to contact this site and away from your troubles. :) :)
