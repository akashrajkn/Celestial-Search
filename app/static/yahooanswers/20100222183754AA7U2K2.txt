Where can I find these pictures of the Copeman Toaster?
What was the website address? It was a sepia toned picture of a window display of the Copeman Toasters. There were other pictures with the same colors; one contained a picture of the toaster with the message It Turns the Toast below the picture, another was  4-step diagram of how the toaster turned the toast.

Go over to Google type it in the choose "Images" and there you have it......as to what your looking for I will try to find a direct link.

The link below will take you straight to Google Images.


This might be it scroll down and you'll have the picture:
