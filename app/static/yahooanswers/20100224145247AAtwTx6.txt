Does cheat engine it's TOTALLY virus free?
i had discovered that mywot say might had virus . at safeweb.norton.com says that too ! site advisor says it's green but ... that darn image from cheatengine.org scared me about that malware !

Search it online
Believe me, it is NOT a virus. There are thousands of hackers use it, Im pretty sure they would have picked up on it. The Cheat Engine Forums is a friendly, helpful community, if Cheat Engine was a virus, the community would not exist.
