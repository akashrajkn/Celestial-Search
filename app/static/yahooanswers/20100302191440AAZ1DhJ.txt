Why doesn't the internet work on one specific page?
So, today I was using the internet and was going to go to this website. At first, it worked. But, then it had this one error. And, it says that it has been resolved and to just close the browser. I did but it was still having problems. So why does it do this?

well.. the site might be down.. also clean your cookies and files by going to tools on the menu bar usually on the left top side of your browser and then options...
