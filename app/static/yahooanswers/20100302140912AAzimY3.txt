Someone please tell me how to get past the web filters.?
Don't give me random proxy sites, they don't help, they're either blocked, or they become blocked after visiting them. I downloaded foxy proxy and that helped with the first filter, but the second filter blocks out other sites, and what the second filter doesn't block the third filter does. So are there any other options?

If you mean while at school. You're not supposed to get around the web filters. Which I seriously doubt if you can anyway.
here are some random proxies
