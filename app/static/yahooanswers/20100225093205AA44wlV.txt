Where can i invite a large amount of people to lockerz?
Without making up emails and generaters, things like that, how can i get people to join lockerz through me?

don't know what lockerz is? email me at adamcharlemclean@hotmail.com and find out ;)

lockerz is kinda like a scam! they only have a 30 second redemption, and only about 5 of each item

points2shop you can buy your items any time for free from amazon.com with your points. lockerz you can get ur stuff once a month and you have to use ur computer the 30 seconds that redemption is open. to join p2s just go to http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=rockthat97 and if you finish any offer you will get double points for life! and also an offer may be as easy as just filling in ur email!
