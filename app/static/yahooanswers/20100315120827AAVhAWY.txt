Where can I download the internet for free?


Are you serious???? wtf
The whole internet - or just a tiddly bit?
I think the better question would be "What is internet?".
You cant download the internet DERP.
Where can you download the internet free? The internet is free. You just pay companies to access the internet through them. You won't find free internet that is quality. You're better of spending $20/month to access the internet at a decent speed.
shove a eithernet cord up your ass and it might work
I think you need to re-phrase and re-ask your question. It sounds like you want to download the WHOLE Internet... as in every web page and every file on the Internet. Surely you don't think that's possible without spending billions of dollars on data centers located all over the world.
Well. You can't. What do you mean in downloading the internet? lol
You can try to download internet explore or firefox
