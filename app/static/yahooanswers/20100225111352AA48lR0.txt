Is there a way to prevent an email hitting a persons inbox... after it has been sent from gmail?
i might have been a wee bit too hasty in using the 'send' button...

no
Not any more so than you can get back a letter you have dropped off at the post office!
You have an option to undo right after the send.  It looks like you only have about 5 seconds to do it.  I am guessing it is way too late if you want to do it now.

If you've already done this then NO. Not for this email sorry. 

In the future you have an option. In gmail you can go to gmaillabs and turn on the option that gives you a small window in which to stop a message from sending. 

This is particularly good if you send people a lot of quick replies and realize you replied to the wrong person etc.

Hope this helps!
