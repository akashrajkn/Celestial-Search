Which eBay seller(s) consistantly has the best penny auctions with free ship?
I love getting stuff for free... and paying only a penny for something is almost like getting it for free!  

On eBay, I have no trouble finding a black pouch for a mp3 player, or a single bead to fit a pandora bracelet, but it seems to be quite time consuming to find any auctions that I can actually win with a $0.01 bid and get free shipping.

Does anyone know of any sellers that frequently has auctions that can be won with only a one-cent bid with free shipping?  Or of any good search tips so I can find them easily?

Some chink.
How would somebody consistently stay in business and why would they continue to do that if it costs 40 something cents just to mail a postcard or letter? That means they lose 30 something cents each time, not to mention ebay fees.
There is another way and is to get the stuff free.
http://www.givingetting.com allow people to give and get stuff they no longer need or to get what they need and don?t have, donating or getting it for reuse, achieving longer product cycle and also keeping useful stuff out of landfills.
The marketplace for donated things. Free stuff to give away or getting and to reuse.
The more people we gather and show them the website, more things are going to be given free and gotten free.
Tell every person you know about this opportunity.
