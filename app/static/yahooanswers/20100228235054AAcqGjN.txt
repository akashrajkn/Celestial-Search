How to see the first tweet you tweeted?
I was wondering if there was a way to see the first tweet you ever sent on twitter! Thanks.
Yes, it is pretty pointless. Haha, I'm kinda like a nerd.

Twitter is the most stupid pointless thing i have ever heard of and seen in my whole life. Do i really need a play by play of your morning routine from getting out of bed in the morning? 

Twitter was invented so starstruck awe infatuated fans of celebs could find out what their fave celeb is up to.   Twitter is not for the average Jane/John to give a play by play of their life. Seriously what makes your every move so special.
