Can they tell your age online if they don't ask for it?
Just curious. Same question with Name,  Phone #, Adress, etc.

If following correct laws and such no they shouldn't.

Also if they don't ask for it how will the know it?
Yes. Because they are psuedo-gods.
No, if you don't tell them they can't know.

But more powerful organizations can trace your IP address to a specific region in the world.
If you know your way around google and hacking you can find stuff like that.
