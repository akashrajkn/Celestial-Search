is it possible to apply multiple amazon.com gift cards to a single purchase?


Yes, it should be possible. When you check out and apply your gift card, there should be a thing you could click where you can add another card.
Yes.  I have done it.  It's slightly cumbersome, as you have to add one card at a time.  If you are patient, however, there is no problem with it.
