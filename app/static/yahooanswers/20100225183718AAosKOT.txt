How come I can get online through the a browser, but I can't get online through games?
Okay so I like to play internet games (Diablo and Warcraft 3) on my spare time (usually around night). So last night I got on one of my games, and it said I wasn't able to get online. I went onto something called Steam, when I tried to log in, it said it was having problems. Today I decided to borrow a bunch of 'online' games from some friends, I installed them and had the same problem which each one. How come I can use internet to do things such as yahoo, but I can't use my internet to play games? I turned my modem/router on and off. I recycled them. Reset them. Gave them new names. Called my internet provider (who dropped me 2 minutes into conversation, almost four times too) and no good came out of that. And now recently my internet in general is becoming slower and more harder to work with.
I have my own laptop and just recently I have been buying my own internet.

it seem that ur parents might have used the parental control option generally given in anti virus
this prevent opening or porn and games site generally .
it can be a case of virus too
scan ur computer first and ask ur parents too or go to anti-virus menu find the option and disable it.
generally this option is password protected. it will be under the heading online security.
