When you submit a Best Offer on Ebay does it count as a Buy It now purchase?
I wanted to know because of the Bing Cashback.  The Seller has it Buy It Now or Best Offer. So If I offer and the seller accepts then I buy, is it a Buy It Now purchase?

Good luck!
Yes it is classed as a buy it now if the seller accepts your offer
when you submit your best 
offer you are in agreement
that you are going to buy it 
if the seller excepts !
good luck !
