Question about the Blogger site?
If somebody has my email address, are they able to use that to find my blog? Is there anyway i can prevent people with my email address from using it to find my blog?
Ty very much.

You could try to go to your settings and change "how people can find me" You just mark off the check box with the finding you with the email thing.
