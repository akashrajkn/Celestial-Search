Would Safari be compatible with an HP Compaq computer with Windows 7?
The reason why i'm asking this is because i searched Safari on wikipedia, it said that Safari  was compatible with Windows 7, but when i clicked on the click to download Safari it said it Mac + PC.

All i want to know: is Safari compatible with an HP Compaq computer with Windows 7?
I have firefox, but it's french. I would like to have another english browser other than AOL, i used to use Internet Explorer before i found out that it had security issues now.

My current browsers are:
AOL (english)
Google Chrome (spanish)
Opera (portuguese)
Flock (italian)
Firefox (french)
SeaMonkey (german)

Yes but I wouldn't recommend it. There have been known security issues that Apple seems to ignore. Use Firefox. It's a better browser anyway.
simple answer: yes
better answer: safari doesn't work too well with pc. you're better off with google chrome or firefox.
Yes...Safari is compatible with just about everything
YES and i would recommend it.
It Rocks.
