Poptropica Membership Question?
If I get the Monthly membership on Poptropica, do I have to pay for it every month and for how long?
Or can I just get it for just one month? 

Please Help!

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** As listed in e-mail confirmations, ANY membership to Poptropica will automatically RENEW at its expiration. So if you don;t want a recurring charge, you have to tell them NOT to renew it!

The membership to Poptropica includes 3 main privileges :
1. Early Access to new islands (about a month earlier than general users)
2. Use of all the "gold cards" and costumes from the Poptropica Store
3. A single room in the Multiverse for use by you and any friends you invite while you are in it.

The obvious advantage is the Early Access. The store privileges do not allow you to KEEP the costumes if you end your membership. To keep them, you would buy them with credits as before.
The Multiverse room is also a small value, since it is currently available permanently if you buy it. (This may change if they find that "renting" them by the month is more profitable.)

The monthly charge is currently $2.99 USD - you can rent for just one month (for now, anyway).
Longer periods of 3 or 6 months give you a discount off the per-month price (each month of a six-month membership averages $2.17 at the current rate). 

Unfortunately, Poptropica has complete control over these services, so it is not impossible that they could increase their prices. This is the only REAL advantage to a long-term commitment, and even that is only locked in for 6 months.
