Firefox Cache Folder in Windows 7?
I'm trying to located the Firefox Cache Folder in Windows 7 to see if I can recover some photos I just looked at with the browser.   

  Anyone know where the folder is located?

Try here:

C:\Users\your username\AppData\ Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\your profile\Cache

Hope that helps.
