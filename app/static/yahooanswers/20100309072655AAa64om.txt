How can I create multiple email accounts quickly?
I need to create around 10-20 email accounts for a project I'm working on, but I don't want to sit down and go through the tedious process of finding a valid username and password, filling out the captcha, etc. Is there any way I can do this quickly and easily, or at least an email hosting service that doesn't take 10 minutes to create an account?

When ya do let us know! lol
try otherinbox.com

There, you setup one e-mail account, then can use multiple names for instance if 

MyEmail is your user name, then you can use

NASCAR@MyEmail.otherinbox.com and
AmerAirlines@MyEmail.otherinbox.com and
FromMom@MyEmail.otherinbox.com

It is free - for limited use - messages only kept 30 days. But you can have them forwarded to another e-mail address.
