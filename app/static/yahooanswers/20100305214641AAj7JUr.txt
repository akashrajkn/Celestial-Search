Wireless internet signal?
Usually, the internet signal from my computer allows my laptop to get the internet. Its not doing that today. Other than waiting or contacting someone over the phone, how do I resolve this? I have a few people living here so Im not satisfied with just one computer..
To the first answer, I have no idea what youre talking about. Please be more visual and descriptive.

find the router, look at the back of it and you'll see a little reset button, most likely you'll have to use a pen or toothpick to push it. push the reset button and hold it in for about 10-20 seconds until the router lights change color, then give it about 2-3 minutes and try connecting through your laptop then.
