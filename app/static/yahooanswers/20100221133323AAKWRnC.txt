ebay sellers fees avoid?
if a seller sells his item for $1 and charges $199 for shipping does he avoid fees from ebay and paypal?

No!
No, but if someone buys that and doesn't notice the shipping cost, they're screwed
That might work once. Then ebay notices and kicks you off.
Well, first of all, that is bad practice. You can get in a lot of trouble for that.

But for answering the question, as far as eBay goes, you do not avoid listings fees or optional fees that get placed on the item. You do avoid eBay Final Value Fees on the $199, however, as eBay does not charge you fees for shipping.  You never avoid fees from PayPal unless you don't accept PayPal and/or the buyer doesn't pay using PayPal.
