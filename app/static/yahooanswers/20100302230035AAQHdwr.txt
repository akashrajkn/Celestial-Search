i think you have problems with your windows or  linux because i have internet explorer 6 and i can watch clips on youtube with no problem try if you have windows xp to defragmenter your files from pc accessories->system tools->disk defragmenter
search your files for disk cleanup run it and when its done and finish search disk defragment you dont half to do it all the way just let it defragment for like 4  to 5 minutes if it is still doing it try re instaling your browser or download a difrent one such as safari at http://www.apple.com/downloads/ then click safari or the opera web browser at http://www.opera.com/ then click download opera the green button or the firefox web browser at http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html again click the green button once at firefox is site and that should do the trick
Google Mozilla Firefox and install it. It Rocks
Else google Apple safari..and install it.
