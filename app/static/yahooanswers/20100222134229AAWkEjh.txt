deleting quizzes on Sporcle?
I'm a Sporcle.com member, and I recently was in the process of creating 2 quizzes to put on the site. Then, I changed my mind about creating them, and now I want to delete them. But, I have no idea how to do that. I don't see a place on the website where I can delete quizzes in progress. Does anyone know where I can delete quizzes that I've started but not yet submitted?
