I sold an item on eBay that got damaged after the listing ended, how do I cancel it?
A day after selling the item (leather shoes), we had a flood in our basement and the shoes are pretty much ruined. The buyer hasn't paid as they told me they were going to pay on Saturday, it's only Friday. Anyways, I mailed the buyer and told them about it. Now, what's the next step?

Has the buyer replied yet?  
You could sent them a request to cancel the transaction, the buyer needs to agree to this before ebay would consider the transaction closed & refund your FVF. I think the buyer can also still leave feedback.
