How to find documents on the computer that I know are there for sure but don't know exactly where?
I know for sure that this mp3 I'm looking for is on my computer but i just can't seem to find it... there you used to be this search thingy on my computer, that seems to have disappeared as well!
Operating system: microsoft windows! and none of the sugggestions work :(
there's no search option on my start thingy!

Depending what op system you have there should be a SEARCH button.
What operating system?
Go to "Start" and click "Search", type in the file name and your pc will tell you where the missing file is. Cheers!
take a long breathhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and sleep the song is delete
Perform a file search from the Windows Start menu and enter the name of the file even if you know it only partially
If you can't find the search function like the people above suggested then open a folder, any one and you should see the search function in the task bar.
go on search and type in .mp3 and every mp3 file will be listed...
Click on START and u will find SEARCH icon, and you can type the name of the mp3 file u wanted. Be sure to look into all the drives of your computer. sometimes it might have got deleted by mistake, check for once in the Recycle Bin.
Go to the "Search Results" and type in the search bar   *.mp3   but before pressing enter button do not forget to make a check mark on the "Search hidden files and folder" in "More advanced option"

All the best
Any OS, Just Give Search command and click search after giving file name... Comp does it search.
