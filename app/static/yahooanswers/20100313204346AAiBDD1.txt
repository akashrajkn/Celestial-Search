i started to download a movie(in " torrent").. it is going on and on staying at 99.9%.. i dont know wat to do.. please help!!

Can't help you with movie theft!
Buy the DVD, no downloading there.
I had the same problem. could be a bad torrent. or just not enough seeds. try dropping the torrent file in the bit torrent again and again till it finds more seeds. other then that nothing you can but wait or get another file and start over. it took me almost 2 days to download one movie do to lack of seeding.
Bad torrent.Serves you right you pirate.Go buy a DVD no downloading there.
This means u ran out of seeder's they have certain time.
----So remove it and watch the movie it's been downloaded 99.9% so u just missed the last names scrolling of the movie.
----The download of the movie should be in
  C:\Users\User name\Downloads

Enjoy the movie!!!!!!!!!
not to worry
movie will run in VLC player
have fun
Don't worry yaar ! If 99.9 % download is complete just shutdown by switching off the power and you will find .PART extension file and that file can be used in K-lite codec pack or VLC media player to watch the movie downloaded .In your case 99.9% movie will be allowed to watch .
I agree with Cooldude and das........

The movie should play fine in VLC player with out any problem , The missing part of the movie will be from the cast and crew names and other unwanted part of the movie.........



Caution: Downloading torrent is against law in few countries , download them only if your country 
allows and does not have any restrictions towards torrent websites......

Good luck
