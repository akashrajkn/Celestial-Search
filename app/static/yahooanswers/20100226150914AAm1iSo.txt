Aim won't let me sign in?
I have been going on aim all day today, and this time when I tried to log on it kept saying incorrect username or password. I KNOW I typed my password in correctly, it's not on caps lock and the numbers aren't locked either. When I click on forgot my password the picture thingy with the letters and numbers combo won't show up. Did I get hacked by some like super genius, or is Aim just not working? Or is it something else? Help!!!1

a lot of people are having the same problem. it's most likely a problem with the AIM servers.

i was just about to ask the same question. i have the same problem too right now. The servers must be down for a while. Just wait....
Yeah, me too....A lot of people seem to be having this issue =( Here's to hoping they fix it!

EDIT - It works now, try again
No, you didn't get hacked. Don't worry.
AIM is either editing the program or they're having some difficulties. It's not just you.
