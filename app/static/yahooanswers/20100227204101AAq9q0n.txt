swagbucks referrals...?
if i refer someone and they refer someone else do i get swagbucks from both of them or just my referral

You only get swagbucks from your direct referrals (and you get upto 100 from there total earnings, aside form swagcodes and offers). 

Meaning if they search and win a swagbuck, you get a swagbuck, but you don't earn from their referalls.
Just your own referral and only up to 100 SB 

Feel free to check out swagbucks via my referral  http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/cazglancy
