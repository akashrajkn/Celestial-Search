Why do people ask random questions on Yahoo?
Don't you think it's annoying?

Nope its fun to answer them lol
I think its fun and funny!
I like them, easy 2 points.
A lot of times when a person asks a question and it seems random, they actually are looking for an answer.  Maybe the answer is so obvious they can't figure it out, or nobody will tell them.  You never what's going on in their life at the time, and they probably are asking it for real!  But then there are those people out there that are just trying to annoy other people or entertain themselves; hopefully not many.
what better place to ask random things? good way of getting an answer, or getting replys, or wasting time.

(if you asked in 'Entertainment & music - polls and serveys'. you'd probably get a lot more answers, and probably is the best section for this question)
Nah, not really. I always look for the most random, I had a quiz taken to me, it was pretty funny, random questions make things better.
