Internet- Browser problems!?
My internet service provider is Bell, and last week I switched from the 60GB per month to 40 GB per month, and apparently it was supposed to be faster with the 40 GB.
I've noticed it isnt faster, and actually slower, and to make matters worse, every time I have my P2P program running (utorrent) (it doesnt matter the download rate), every time I try to open a web browser it says, 'server not found: problem loading page'
Have any of you had the same problem..because if its just me, then it mught be my interenet or firewall setting or soemthing.
Any suggestions?

P2P clients like utottents choke the networks.
Try to exit then surf on browser !
update browser
