CollegeHumor.com under government surveillance?
Okay, so i googled collegehumor.com and saw a gray screen, with the seal of the united states on it.
Then in bold black type it said my IP address was being monitored because the site collegehumor.com was being monitored for unamerican activity or content. What does any of that mean? college humor's being monitored? why? and why and how long will my IP address be monitored?

Probably until April Fool's day is over.
Likely just an April fools day prank.
the US gov. monitors ALLweb activity. You need to start using tor or a web proxy to surf the net.
i'm not positive but i read on yahoo that a lot of websites are playing "april fool's jokes" 
so that could be the case here...

example: type in google .. it says something else when you get to the main page .. like TOPEKA
