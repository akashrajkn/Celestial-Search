Please help me register on this website.?
Can someone help me to register to the website: http://www.chaoticcardcodes.com/index.ph¡­ I went there and there is only one link to register which is under the "Forum" tab, but when I clicked on it it sent me to a page that said, "You are not authorized to view this page! You need to log in." But how can I log in if it will not even let me register? If you can, please help me. Thank you!
it's for an online card game, and thanks for trying, I was wondering if it was just my internet, but fortunately it's not, it's just the website, wow lots of commas
