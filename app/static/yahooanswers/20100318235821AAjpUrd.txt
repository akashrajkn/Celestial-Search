Which BSNL Broadband tariff suits me?
My download is little bit larger, almost 3-6 GB per month and my current tariff is Rs 250 monthly fixed.
Unlimited download...If you know please tell me BSNL tariff that suits me which will not exceed the bill above Rs 950.

Try out unlimited plan(rs 600) bsnl or airtel . But the speed is 256 Kbps.
I was also like you. Then the previous month we changed our BSNL tariff from Home Plan 250 (1 GB) to Home Plan U(Unlimited) 750 (unlimited download). The monthly tariff is Rs.750, which is within your budget. The speed is quite good. Therefore, I recommend you to change your plan to Home Plan U750.
First month, they will charge you an extra Rs.750 as security deposit.
you can take broad band of bsnl in which 
there will be unlimited dowloading at the rate of 750..
but in pack of 500 u will get 2.5 GB and downloading will be free before 8am and after 10pm....
u can take 500 C   combo pack if u can download during night time..It has 1GB free at day time and night 2 to 8 am unlimited... its excellent plan because ur downoading speed will be upto 250kbps and browsing speed upto 2MBps...
Take bsnl broad band plan 500 COMBO PLUS, speed 512 kbps, 4 GB free, rent NIL, 100 calls free, at monthly charges of 599/=
use 750 unlimited plan speed is upto 256kbps
