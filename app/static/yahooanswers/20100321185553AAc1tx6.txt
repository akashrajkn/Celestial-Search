Does your activity on Limewire show on your Internet History?
Does your activity, such as what you have downloaded on Limewire, show up on Internet history. Or could you see it from a different computer, eg. if there were three or four laptops using the same WIFI, could the others possibly see what you've downloaded?

No your history of what you download is on just limewire and heres how to delete it.
