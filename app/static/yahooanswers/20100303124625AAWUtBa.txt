Why bid days in advance on EBay?
Since EBay has a hard time stop for each auction, why do people bid days in advance for no-reserve items on EBay when they can just wait and bid close to the end of the auction? 

It makes no logical sense to bid early, you only drive up the price. Sure, every now and then maybe you want to put a ridiculously high bid in for something because you want it so badly, although this would only tempt someone to try and out-bid you and give them plenty of time to do it. People often put in low bids early, which makes no sense. A better strategy would be to put the high bid in right before the auction ended so other bidders would not have time to keep bidding.

Are these people just stupid?

You have to remember, there are some people out there who have no idea how to bid and just do what Ebay says, like things like these 'Bid now so you are the first bidder or bla bla...'

Yes some are just plain stupid as well.

I always used to do it right at the last 3 seconds..heh
Obviously, you have already a pre-conceived opinion of early bidders, so any attempt to convince you otherwise would be futile.  But here's my response anyway, based on my experience on Ebay:

Some people simply don't want to spend their days on bidding war games.  They know how much the item is worth and how much they are willing to pay. If it drives the price up, so be it, they know it's not worth more than their max bid.

Some people are simply forgetful, or are not necessarily available when the bidding ends, so they bid in advance.
