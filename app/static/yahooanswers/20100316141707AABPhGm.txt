How do I view network security cameras at my school?
Hey, how do I view network security cameras at my school? At my school, I am able to view all the network security cameras on a school computer. How do I do this at home? I know my school's IP address...

I think that is not a good idea to do,thatis something that you will get in big trouble doing something like that. it is not legal?
