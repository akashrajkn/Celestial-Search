Chatroulette troubleshooting help?
it says that i need to allow peer to peer connections. I allowed this on my regular firewall, and it still doesnt work. I'm guessing its the windows firewall. Anyone know where exactly i can change this? 

thank you

Why in the hell would you want to go on Chatroulette?
have you tried putting your penis up to the webcam? that seems to work well
