check the status of my email to see if it was "opened"?
I know theres websites that can hack into that sort of thing, like msngeeks.com for msn to see if someone blocked you or deleted you off your list
but how can I tell if a email i sent through hotmail was opened. ..anyone know any lil tricks?

go to www.didtheyreadit.com
create an account there with the email address you are sending the emails from.
and follow the instructions on the website on how to track and email u have sent.
they will give you 10 trial open email confirmation.. after that you have to purchase if u want to continue using it.
