Lockerz prices and ptz amounts?
I'm thinking of joining Lockerz, and I want to know how much stuff costs (2 or 3 examples please) and how many points you get (on average) per day. I heard you get points from polls or something, how much is this?

thanks in advance

well lockerz has a points system. fore example you get two points a day fore logging in and 2 fore watching videos and completing yes or no questions. fore rewards they will have game(xbox,ps3,wii,ds,psp) fore 400 points and mac book pro fore 4000 and those are just two examples. you also need to be invited to join which i will do gladly.
They update 2-3 videos a day. Lets say 3. thats 6 points
Login equals 2 points.
Daily Question=2 points
10 points=1 day
