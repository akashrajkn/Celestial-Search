Does anyone want a Lockerz Account With over 260+ points?
Swapping my lockerz Account Which has over 260+ points these points can be used to buy Nintendo Wii's, psp's etc... 

But i dont have time to vist regularly and use my points.

So, anyone who wants this account just tell me what you have to swap and we can come to some agreement.

Here's a screenshot of my overview
