If i bought my IMVU prepaid card at a self checkout will it be activated?
I'm thinking about buying an IMVU prepaid card, but i feel really gay buying it from a cashier. So I want to know if I buy it at a self checkout, will it be activated?

...Wow.
Anyways it should be activated. However I'm not sure...which is why you should do it the way you are sure to get the card and have it work. Cashier's see A LOT of things; I doubt they'll care about a prepaid card. XD
