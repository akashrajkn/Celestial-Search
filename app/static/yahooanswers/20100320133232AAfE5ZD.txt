A couple questions about Twitter?
1. Will I be charged by twitter on my phone from them sending me updates?
2. My number will not get out on the site will it?
3. Will I be able to cancel the mobile updates when I want?

1. It depends on your carrier and plan. It is sent as a regular text with no charge extra than what you are normally charged for a text from out of network phones.
2. No
3. Yes
Q1. Will I be charged by twitter on my phone from them sending me updates?

A1: Depends, do you have unlimited text messaging with your cell provider, or do you pay for text messages? Twitter won't charge you, but a text message is a text message no matter who sends it, and your cell provider might/will/could..

Q2. My number will not get out on the site will it?

A2: NOTHING you give any site is 100% safe. Hackers hack for a reason. If they hack twitter, then yeah - it could happen.

Q3. Will I be able to cancel the mobile updates when I want?

A3: Yes.

Here's an interesting site you might want to review before you start telling all your followers where you are, and what you're doing. It's not Twitter-based, but the idea can very easily be extended (and who knows - someone may already be doing it privately):

Interesting how people who would scold a child for talking to strangers are so willing to tell strangers on the Internet where they are and what they're doing themselves, don't you think?
