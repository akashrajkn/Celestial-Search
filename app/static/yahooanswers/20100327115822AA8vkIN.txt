No internet connection?!?!?!?
Ok. so I was playing on my computer and I exit off Internet for about, 10 minutes. Then, my internet wouldn't display web page. This was happening for about a year, and then my mom helped me and we got a new router and it doesn't snap in, so we taped it on with tape. Now, the optimum homepage shows up, but if I press a link it says it cannot display web page again! Please can someone help me! I need to go on my computer! I'm desperate! [by the way, it's a dell desktop and it's not wireless, it's connected to a computer upstairs, and the computer upstairs, shares a wire with two computers downstairs. The computer upstairs works and so does the other one downstairs, but not mine!] I'm using the computer upstairs! (I just wan't the one in my room to work so I can use it whenever withought getting kicked off by my sister!) Please help me! thank you!

Anytime that happens...simply unplug the power wire on the router and modem for 1 minute...allow 5 minutes for them to resync with your computer.

Cheers
