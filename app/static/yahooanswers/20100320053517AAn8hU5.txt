Help Joining Second Life?
Hi I need help joining second life. My college blocks the register page but not the actual thing. I just need someone to register for me so that I can join. If someone would do that I would be eternally grateful.

Oh dear god, please dont join!  save yourself before its too late :[   it will waste so much of your time
I'd suggest going to a location such as a cyber-cafe or similar location and doing the registration yourself; it's not EVER wise to give out personal information to total strangers and allow them to use it in your name.  Computer and personal identity security are important, and your own personal safety is even more so.  Do what's wise, and register for yourself; protect your privacy and your personal safety first and foremost when it comes to doing ANYTHING online.  There is no web-based game, music or other online site that is NEARLY as important as your personal safety.
