it has good speed about 245kb/s downlink,55kb/s uplink 

try it it's goood
It gives unlimited(free browsing and downloading) internet for 30 days without any FUP.And if you are lucky you might even get to download at 3G speeds for this small amount.
I just want to know if anyone has successfully recharge with it since I was previusly using the 230 STV and then a few days back the 230 STV just stop working before its 30 days period and I was charge for downloading from main account.
Later I recharge with 274 STV (since the 230 STV has now been replace with 274 STV) BUT UNLUCKILY IT gave some problems.
