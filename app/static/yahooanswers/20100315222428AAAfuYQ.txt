How to enable JavaScript into your browser?
Hi,
so I was wanting to go on this website that converts youtube videos into mp3 files and it hasn't been working out. Link: http://www.video2mp3.net/about.php
I tried it in two different... well now three browsers and nothing is happening. I read on the website that it needs to have JavaScript enabled... so is mine already not? My main browser is Safari, then I used FireFox and then Google Chrome. Thanks!
