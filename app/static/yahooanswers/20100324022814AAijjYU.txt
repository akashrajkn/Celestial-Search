Hmm whats that site called?
Okay so I have this email address but I cant remember the site! Last time I was on it, it had a red/black background and I really wanted to say it was "Aim" but it wasnt! Maybe you could google my user name and help me ---> "kagomay761" Any who I REALLY want to say it started w/ an a or its less than four letters.

I had an email account with rock.com and the page was black and red.
What was on the site? What was it for or the theme of the site?
Use your history functions...

Internet Explorer:  Press the stopwatch button with the arrow over it and navigate to "last night"

Mozilla Firefox:  Press the History tab on top and click show all history.  Navigate to "last night"

^_^
If you know what the full email address, ie kagomay761@[somesite].com then everything after the @ normally points to the site that it is registered, like @gmail.com or @yahoo.com.
Did you sign up for the website? Then check your mail... there'd be a confirmation E-Mail.

Check your browser History or the Saved Passwords if you've already not have deleted them both. But, you can search what you were looking for in that site and refine the results the sites you've checked before will be highlaighted in google.

Hope this helps.
