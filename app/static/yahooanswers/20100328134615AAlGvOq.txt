If I recieve money on paypal, is it used next time on ebay?
Say i recieve a gift of money on paypal, and i keep it in my paypal account. Next time i buy something on ebay and pay through paypal, is the gifted money used or does the money come from my debit card as it does normally?

thanx

Mine is used from my paypal account money first  and if there is not enough they take the rest from my card. If you don't want them to use the gifted money you transfer it 0ut to your bank account before you pay for anything else.
Paypal will automatically use the balance on your paypal account first, then the balance (if required) from your normal funding source.
After you've bought something on eBay, and go to Paypal to pay, you'll be presented with whatever options you have to pay - from which bank account, directly from your Paypal account, etc. Just choose where you want the payment to come from.

Good luck!
