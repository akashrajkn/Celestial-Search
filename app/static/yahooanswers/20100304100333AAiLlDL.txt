How can you join SpinVox?
How do you get in? Is it invite only or something? I cannot find a register link on the main page.

In general you can only sign up if your mobile network supports it.

If you are in Canada, there is a fair chance your carrier has a deal with them, whilst there are a handful of US, South American and Australian networks who can subscribe you to the service also.

They used to have a 'retail' outreach program, particularly in the UK, where they would enable a service for you if you were a firend of the company, a blogger, a journalist, or worked for a telco - however I believe that programme has been slowed since the acquisition by Nuance. If you aren't lucky enough to be subscribed to a supporting carrier, but think you should experience SpinVox and can explain to them why, then try using the contact details on their site to get in touch.
