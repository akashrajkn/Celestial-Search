Its been 3 days, and it still says sale pending on play.com?
I've sold an item on play.com using playtrade, and its been 3 days since this person has ordered, but its said sale pending since 3 days ago. What's going on? Ive emailed play and ive got nothing
Somebody help me please

I'd call play.com (0845 800 1020) and just ask what the protocol is for selling an item/getting payment etc...
