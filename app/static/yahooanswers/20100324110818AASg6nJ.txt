How do I send a "tweet" directly to someone on Twitter?
....Like, if my tweet is only intended & directed towards only one of my 'friends' and not everybody else, how do I do that, or rather, how do I send that? Thank you in advance & ~~God bless!~~

You have to make sure you are following them or they are following you first ~ I'm pretty sure there is a private message section ~ I don't use it much and what I have to say, well I don't care who sees it :)
