Walmart sucks.
Go somewhere else.
walmart.com is a good site (maps to: 161.170.248.20).

This 'sounds' like a problem with your internet connection.
Try to google "walmart" and follow the 1st link which is walmart.com
if google does not work then you definitely have a problem with internet connection.
