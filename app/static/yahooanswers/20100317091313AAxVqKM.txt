Don't worry, you don't need to really learn CSS to fix it. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" - they are used in web design. Just follow these steps to correct your problem:

1. Open My Computer; navigate to this file: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\res\ua.css
2. Open the file (in Wordpad).
3. Press Ctrl-F. In the Find window, enter: moz-any-link:focus
4. You should see the following:

*|*:-moz-any-link:focus {
  /* Don't specify the outline-color, we should always use initial value. */
  outline: 1px dotted;
}

5. Where it says "outline: 1px dotted;", replace the text with "outline: none;". Now it will say

*|*:-moz-any-link:focus {
  /* Don't specify the outline-color, we should always use initial value. */
  outline: none;
}

6. Close Firefox if it is open. Save the changes.
7. You're done! Problem should be resolved when you re-launch Firefox.

Good luck!
