Why can't I see images on webpages?
I recent;y downloaded IE8 and since, most websites that I visit regularly have a little box inside the frame where the video or pic is supposed to be. I have gone as far as to check my Internet Options to make sure show pic is selected and cleared all of my history. What else can I do?
