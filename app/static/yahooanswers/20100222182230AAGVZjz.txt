How can I find a certain person on Chatroulette?
I was talking to this guy for more than an hour and my computer crashed which made me disconnect with him. I really want to find him again, but I have no idea how to do it. =( Please help!

Trial and error, sadly. :(
You cannot - that's the whole point of the site.  You're completely anonymous unless you choose to give out skype, facebook, msn, etc.  You cannot track someone down on CR because there is nothing that identifies people.  The same thing happened to me.  It sucks so I'd recommend exchanging info if you really like the person bc it freezes and crashes all the time. :(
I'm also looking for a person on chatroulette. I talked with her(from norway) yesterday but the connection failed. So if you are this person ^^ you can contact me.
I too got froze when speaking to someone from Chicago ill winnetka so if youre him contact me here. you spoke to me about an hour ago thurs and we got disconnected!
