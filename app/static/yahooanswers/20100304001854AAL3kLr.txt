You wanna see something weird? look closely at this video. You have to look close or you will miss it. blow it up full screen. and watch.

I find some funny and weird pictures on www.i-am-bored.com you can find alot of other stuff on there too like links that will take you to see other weird and funny things.
http://www.fffound.com is cool for like artsy photos. Or even if you aren't very artsy its still pretty cool to look at.

http://www.peopleofwalmart.com is pretty cool too. In a different way though... haha

http://www.failblog.org is pretty entertaining.

http://www.flickr.com often has a better variety than photobucket.

http://www.chrisandpaige.blogspot.com is a really good craft/art blog. Not to mention she has a TON of links to other sites you might enjoy.

Hope that helps!
