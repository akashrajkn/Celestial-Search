After upgrading from IE 6 to IE 8 I appear to have lost my Bookmarks, on the toolbar Bookmarks is shaded out?


...This is a statement, not a question, I'm not sure what you're asking, you even said yourself that the bookmarks tab is disabled, meaning you don't have any.
IE8 is more trouble than its worth  , you will regret installing  it
