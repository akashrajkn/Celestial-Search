Internet Problem - Why do I need to keep refreshing?
Hey, I've noticed an odd happening with my browser recently (Firefox). Almost every time I click on a link, for example, signing in to this website - the page reloads but nothing has happened. Then, when I refresh the page it acknowledges that I am signed in and shows me the appropriate updated page. Pretty much all links have been behaving like this. Any one know what the problem could be?

you have to much things or a virus in your pc ,
Same thing happens me sometimes:

try this


Go to control panel.
Then Internet Options
Browsing History - Settings

Make sure the dot is on "Automatically"
