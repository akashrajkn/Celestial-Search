Why is this pesky ask.com site keep coming up?
I don't know why but there's a pesky site called ask.com that will take over my home page from time to time.

I thought I eliminated all trace of it from my computer using Revo Uninstaller.

What's the deal with this site???

You're homepage has been hijacked. Get anti-spyware and run it. http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-adware-spyware-scumware-remover.htm#Quick_Selection_Guide
ask.com has a lot of programs they partner with to auto install their toolbars etc. when you download freeware/shareware. You can uninstall it usually through windows, but I would recommend running Malwarebytes anti malware (free AV program) just to be sure.
