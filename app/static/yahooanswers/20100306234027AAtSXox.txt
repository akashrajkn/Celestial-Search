If i give Points2shop my addres will they send me stuff i didn't ask for?
I started and account on Points2shop.com if you want account message me i have to send you a invite to it, Anyway back tot he question if i give them my address will they send me stuff i didn't ask for

Two things:

1.They won't. But some offers will.

2.You do not send anyone an invite. It is not required. It is not like Lockerz. They can sign up on their own without a referral.
No they won't.
