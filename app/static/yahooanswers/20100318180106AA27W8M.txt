if i fall into a space/time paradox, who should i kill first?
I really need to know, because I'm in one right now with chuck Norris and Mr.T(i cannot and will not kill them). i think I'm in the 1940's

wow internet in the 1940s? who knew. i guess you should somehow make sure george bush jr,. was never born.
Alphonso Ribierto
Hm I think you should start with the guy that sang "I don't want to set the world on fire". That song just sucks!

Yourself.
Buy real estate in LA and San Francisco, MicroSoft and Apple stock, some Berkshire Hathaway,  invent the internet, cell p hones, and cable TV.  Don't eat the red M&Ms. Learn guitar and move to Liverpool.  Bet against the Red Sox every season.  You must have 1000's of ideas for screenplays and novels, start writing.
