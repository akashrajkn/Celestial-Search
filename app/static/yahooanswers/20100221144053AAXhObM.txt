Virus from music transferred or no?
if i download music off the internet that contains a virus and then put it in itunes and and then on the home sharing i send the music to a different computer, will the virus be transferred as well or is the virus just in the computer you downloaded the music to?

You will transfer the virus also. Think, man!
