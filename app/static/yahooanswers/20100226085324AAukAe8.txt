I installed Java update & Adobe Flash Player update & now I can't see videos on YouTube using either browser?
YouTube says I need to turn on JavaScript or install new version of Flash Player.  I have the latest version of the Flash Player installed and JavaScript is on "on" the Firefox browser.  When I tried viewing a Youtube video using Internet Explorer, it just shows me a black box where the video should play and simply doesn't play.

I've also cleared the recent History on my Firefox Browser.  

Should I turn Comodo Firewall off?  Would that help?
Should I delete the last updates somehow?  (Java & Adobe Flash Player)

Everything seemed to be working fine until I installed the Java update but that could just be a coincidence. 

Any help would greatly be appreciated...
Would using System Restore to go to a previous date correct this?
Restarting or rebooting didn't help anything...

you have to install flash player for other browser
maybe google for this file
install_flash_player_ax.exe
it would be a bad idea to shut off fire-wall unless you put a time limited for how long for,or other wise the viruses will get-in,do not want that to happen?there is a warning about down-loading adobe flash player did you not see it?that is no coincidence,was not your computer working properly before you installed  java and the flash-player?
restart your computer
Java has nothing to do with YouTube, as youtube runs in flash player. Try restarting and clearing your cache.
