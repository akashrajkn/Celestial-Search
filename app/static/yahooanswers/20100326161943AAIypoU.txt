is there a way to tell if someone read my email i sent them im using hotmail and if so how do i tell?


No. There isn't.
Unless you have access to their e-mail account, there is no way to tell whether your message has been read or not. If a person gets a lot of mail and doesn't want to mess with all the messages, he or she can mark them all as "Read or "Unread." So the only way to know would be to talk to the person in question, and ask if they have received your message. Or, you may send out a "Test" message, and set the perameters of your account so that when your message is opened/read, the other person's account will send a confirmation that they have opened your message.
