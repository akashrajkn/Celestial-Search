When does Lockerz restock?
i got the points now, but i'm just wondering when it restocks.

They don't tell people. You have to check the website daily.
When they feel like it!
Lockerz is not a very reliable site, they hardly ever have stock and it can take forever to save up enough points to get anything! Try another similar site called Points2Shop.

Whilst completing offers is the primary way of getting points, you can also play games and get referrals net you up to a dollar each (100 points) which you can use to spend on amazon or convert into cash!

Use my referal link to sign up here : http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=uin1268525798

This gets me some extra points and starts you off with 250 ($2.50) of your own! I can help you with anything once you are there! Good luck!
Hello Friend,

As you see there's the competition: March Radness, International vs U.S.A
The Team who wins will get their own redemption
They will say who win but they will not tell us day or time
Also Remember that the prizes in this redemption will go up the 4x
But there will be many more PRIZES!!!

So Good Luck in the redemption
I hope this answer helps you

Se yaa ;D
every month
They restock in random date and time. they announced that this month will be surprise redemption.

My recommendation to you is to use LockerzAlerts http://www.lockerzalerts.com this service will send you text messages to you mobile phone when the redemption occurs - Its also FREE !


Good luck on the redemption !
