Is there a free file hosting website that will pay me per download?
Like Ziddu.com but with unlimited or large uploads (around 1gb would do rightly)

It's unlikely since those kind of file hosting services earn money and pay you by showing ads. That means that every time someone's downloading something they see some ads which pay for: their bandwidth, servers, electricity, employees, plus your earnings and their profit.

If everybody posted huge files that would mean that they would show a lot less ads per MB of download which probably wouldn't be enough to pay for everything.
