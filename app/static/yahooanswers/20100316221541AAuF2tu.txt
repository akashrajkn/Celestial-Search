Paypal wont let me sign in!!?? No email?
hi I tried signing in to paypal but everytime I get the error message "You must enter both your email address and password. Please try again." I dont understand I put BOTH in. I keep retyping my email address then putting in my password, but it still wont work.

This is probably a result of your security settings within the browser.

Try and turn down the security level and see what you get...
I'd call or message them, I had a similar problem, they change your password for a temporary one and you change it afterwards to what you want, I used the phone, really easy, idk about the messaging route.
all sites get some security glitch or you might be putting the wrong password, either ways, contact them.
You may have been 'phished' or your account otherwise hijacked .. 

Contact PayPal IMMEDIATELY (before some crook empties your bank account / maxes out your linked credit card)
