what is the best website to download movies and music?
I just got a new laptop (SONY, VAIO), ive been using limewire on my PC (super old school dell), but i think that there might be a better way to get music and movice... Can anyone give any reccommendations?

mediafire.com
www.thepiratebay.org I've been going there for a long time. It's a torrent site so there's always a risk. Read peoples reviews of the torrent before downloading it.
Try  Hulu.com


Some are mostly trailers though
download torrents.....lots of different torrent sites available

No torrents all direct downloads, Its 100% free you dont even need to register.
If the movie you want isent there just request it and u will have it withing 3 days or less.
