Websites??? Please Answer?
Whats the best FREE program/site for making other sites. I've used dream weaver and piczo before. Are there any better ones?

Also, if I put a password on a websites homepage, can people still get through to the other pages?

Dreamweaver is the industry standard... have a look at the built-in templates...

also there is http://www.webs.com/ to make a free website and http://www.wix.com/ if you wanted to create a flash web site

Usually if you put a password on yr homepage people wont be able to get thru to the other pages

If you require further help or want to ask me anything go to http://www.crossloop.com/antworks
i'd be happy to help and you can also share your screen with me
webs.com
1) In my opinion, the best free program is NotePad (I actually use cPanel code editor, but same diff...). I HATE big clunky programs like dreamweaver that hog memory and my time, so I hand-code everything.

2) Yes, so put a password on everything. Possibly use htaccess to restrict the entire site, tutorial here: http://surlz.net/1t
