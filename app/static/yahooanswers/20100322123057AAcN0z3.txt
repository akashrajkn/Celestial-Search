what does wta mean on craigslist?
Im sure people on craigslist dont mean Women's Tennis Association --_- so please give me a better answer.

People will say  "WTA- puppy to good home" or something like that!

BLOND MOMENT. ma'am, please look at the keyboard.. do you notice that the letter "A" is very much close to the letter "S"?  They mean WTS = Wants To Sell - Puppy to good home
