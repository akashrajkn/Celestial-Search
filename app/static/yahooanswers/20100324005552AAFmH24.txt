Need an active, decent sized forum community to post with?
Tonight, I went to an old Halo(the video game) Podcasting website that I used to post on when I was 15.. I'm now 18. 

I had over 1000 posts there and looking through them tonight, I got very nostalgic and missed the feeling of posting with a nice and active forum community where everyone knew each other..

If anyone has any cool forums they know of(or post on themselves), that would be awesome. I was really into Halo when I posted on those forums, but now I play WoW. I'd prefer the main topic of the forum to be video game based, but any suggestions in general would be nice.

Thank you very much!

If you are 16, then you are about to get a car I would imagine. I always like car forums, so if you want to get a Honda, then start browsing and posting in Honda sites, even some geared particularly to what model you want or are going to get.

I always like to look at different customizations/mods, and performance ideas. Plus you meet others in you area and can buy used parts.
