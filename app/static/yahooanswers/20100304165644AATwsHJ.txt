how does ebay work...?
1-if it says 'buy now' will they ship it to you right away or do you have to bid
2-if it does say buy now, but it says x amount of days left, do you have to wait x amount of days?

buy it now preempts any bids. and they will ship in accordance w/ individual policy.
but the item is yours and you don't have to wait the days left, this is only for bidding purposes.
1. You just have to click on "Buy Now" but make sure you actually pay!!
2. No, if you buy it now you end the auction, therefore making you the winner of the item. Hurrah!
