Try Kijiji! I've had a lot of success selling things on there, and you can sell it to someone nearby who can pick it up, or you can bring it to them.

Try to sell your bike on B2C/B2B/C2C sites like: http://ww w.ebay,com, http://amazon,com and http://www.topbuysell.com . If i were u, i would try all 3 to increase my traffic to the max and make more people know them. You may search more such sites to promote your products.  Good luck
Try Main Street Fair Online Auctions and Classifieds they have low listing fees and it's easy to use. Classifieds under $200 are free and so are books.
