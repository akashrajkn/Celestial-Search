I made my first website, what do you think of it?
kuzzi.lifeyo.com

Please give me some pointers on what I could do to make this website more appealing to people. The subjects that it will cover are: humor, philosophy, games, anime, programming, engineering, and more. I am building it purely to provide entertainment for people with interests similar to mine. 

Also, as a 2nd (bonus) question, what could I do to spread the word about the site?

The term "bonus question" is normally used in a radio or TV quiz where participants are winning money or prizes by answering questions correctly - the bonus question, often optional, gives the contestant the chance to double his current winnings
I like the design, just not a big fan of the hit counter, that's out of fashion now. 

Spreading the word: put the url into forum profiles, email signatures, submit it to google for indexing, submit it to review sites, add good content (something fresh rather than iterating what's already out there) and pray :)
I really like your site. I would recomend you to put a title at the top of each page above the navigation that says Kuzzy or whatever the name of your website is. Other than that, it's really cool.

Ideas for getting the word around:
- Submit your site to a bunch of search engines. Just search "submit site to [search engine's name]" and after that your site will be higher up on the page if someone searches something relating to your site. Try Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask.com, etc.
- Put a link to your site at the bottom of all your emails, letters, etc.
- Start a chain mail message advertising your website and encourage all your friends to send it to as many people as they can.
