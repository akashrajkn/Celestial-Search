What is the best internet browser which is free?
What is the best internet browser which is free? E.G. fire fox, google chrome. at the moment im running snow leopard on my mac book.

Firefox in my opinion.  Most browsers if not all are free
Google chrome is by far the fastest ive seen on a mac. firefox and safari are pretty bloated. id go with chrome.
Here is my opinion

Safari is garbage (glitchy, terrible security)
IE is more or less also garbage.
Chrome is pretty good.
Firefox is the best.
Try a few different ones. The one you like best will be the best browser for you.

I use Firefox, it really comes down to personal preference.
Mozilla Firefox is the best!
I have to agree with the firefox people Firefox is the best Internet Explorer in my own opinion is bullshit it runs to slow mozilla firefox is very fast
Mozilla Firefox 3.6, very customizable (themes, etc), super fast, and warns you of an insecure website.
