Wireless Internet Connection Connects then Disconnects Repeatedly!?
So, I have a dell net book and the wireless connection has always been fine and then all of a sudden the connection comes and goes! it's so frustrating! I don't think I've done anything different to my computer. Somebody please help me!

device manager > network adapters > uninstall wireless lan > restart your computer and let windows reload and refresh the drivers.....you will see a message ''found new hardware'' on restarting your computer
this happens to me all the time on my iPod touch. it's just something interfering with the signal.  I find that when someone is on the phone (landline) or it is ringing, it is very low to no signal.  it's the chance you take with wifi.
if your still not sure on what to do
then go to your local computer store and get them to look at it and fix it for you
