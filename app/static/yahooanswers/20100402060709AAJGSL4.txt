My screen is pink :S?
My sister was futtering with my laptop the other day and now my background on internet explorer is pink when on ebay, clear tabs etc. Does anyone know how to change it back?
Thanks in advance

Try go to Personalize "Window Colour & Appeareance"(For Vista)
Do NOT CLICK on the link posted by the user above, "manofbluedog."

The link is to a malware program. I've run it through a scan and it appears to be a keylogger and possibly more.

I've reported him to Yahoo and I'm hoping they're turn his information over to the FBI, but he's probably a foreigner outside of US jurisdiction.
