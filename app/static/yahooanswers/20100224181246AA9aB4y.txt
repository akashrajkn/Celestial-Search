What is this website?
I remember a website I went on quite a while ago, and i don't remember the name of it. The entire website was games where you'd have to type things in for a category. There were ones like the digits of pi, elements of the periodic table, songs for different bands. Anyone know this website? It'd be great if you do!
And it's not on a regular gaming site. It's an entire website with the same thing
You have a category, like one I remember is Adam sandler movies. You have a certain amount of time to get all teh different answers. You type it in, and if it's there it comes up, if not it doesn't

I think there are a couple of websites that do that, but heres one http://www.sporcle.com/
