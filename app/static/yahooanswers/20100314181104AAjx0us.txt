I just became a member of Demonoid and Im trying to get invitation codes?
Demonoid doesnt tell you how how to get them, and i have some friends that really wanna get on Demonoid. What do i need to do?

whoever can help me out to get my invite codes i'll send you one.

When you sign in at the top right click "Control Panel" and you will see the invitations just click "create a new invitation code" to see if you have any by the way registrations on demonoid are open right now they could just go quickly and sign up before the y close.
You have to be a member at least 30 days.  After that they are given out at random.  Registration is open right now though.
