Is there a way to watch the 82nd Academy Awards live online?
I'm looking for any dependable and trustworthy method to stream the Oscars live on March 7th, over an internet connection in the US.

I'm willing to pay a reasonable fee for this if necessary. Does anyone know if there is a service to stream such things, or if it is being streamed for free from any sources?

Avatar all the way ;) 9 nominations, how many awards? let us wait n watch
