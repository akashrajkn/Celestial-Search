Does anyone know of a website where i can find a bunch of symbols like hearts, music notes, etc?


Unless you're looking for fancy graphics, you can create those symbols with your keyboard alone.
1. Make sure your keyboard is in NumLock mode.
2. Hold down the ALT key and enter the number on the numeric keypad. (Note that many laptops have a blue FN key that changes a set of keys, also with blue numbers on them and usually in the 7-8-9-U-I-O area, into a numeric keypad.) 
3. If it doesn't work the first time try hitting space and then the character you want.

Try http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters .

All current Unicode characters are in the charts of charts at http://www.unicode.org/charts/ . The second chart at the bottom of the page covers symbols.

Note that every Unicode character has a unique hexadecimal code assigned to it which can be used to create HTML entities that work in many web forums like this one. Looking at http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf shows that the black heart has the hexadecimal code 2665. So if I enter the HTML entity in his post as & # x 2 6 6 5 ; without the spaces, I get ?.

Note that I can only see a symbol on the web when it is in at least one of the Unicode fonts on the system.
