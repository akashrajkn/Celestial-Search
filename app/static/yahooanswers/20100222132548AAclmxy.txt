Who knows where I can watch Firefly online for free?
I'm looking for a website that has the second episode of Firefly. I was too young to appreciate it when it was on TV, and now I'm looking for it online. If someone could just give me the link to s01 e02 ('The Train Job') that I could go to to watch it online without downloading it, that would be great.

If you're willing to wait, Hulu's going to have more of the series available to watch online soon.

Also, there's got to be someone around you know who's got the DVDs. I know you can buy the whole 14-episode run of the show for under $20.
