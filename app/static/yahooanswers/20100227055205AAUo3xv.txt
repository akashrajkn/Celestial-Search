question about woome.com?
i signed up for woome.com and then got a bunch of e-mails saying 'so and so has accepted your friend request.' i never added anyone but looked at my profile and somehow have a bunch of friends. why is this? is this site just a scam? is someone using my account? please help, thanks!

It's another form of the "Welcome Wagon'. It's fine. Nothing's wrong.

I'd go more into the subject.

i think it is your friends suggestion and you can accept them or not.
Hmm. Either someone has hacked your account or there's a bug with friend requests that we're not aware of. 

Can you please submit your help request in our support forums so that we can track it if it is indeed a bug? 

thanks!
