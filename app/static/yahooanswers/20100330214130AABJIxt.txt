Where can I find a good free penpal site?
I'd like to get in touch with someone around my age in Wales (to learn a bit of Cymraeg and have a friend there before I travel) but I discovered that the website I was attempting to use requires you to pay in order to contact other members. I'm 17. Where should I go?
