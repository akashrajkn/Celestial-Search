Any bloggers out there?
I have a question for those who blog.  I had some relatives who live far away write some pretty terrible things on my blog and have no idea how they found my blog.  Could it be from me downloading pictures from their blog?  They were just family pictures and thought they were cute.  They had no copyright on them at all and didn't post about not using their pictures.  They just came unglued.  I deleted them but wonder how they found my blog in the first place unless another relative gave them my blogsight.

Yes, the pictures DO have copyright on them, and using them without permission is a no-no.

As to how they found them, if you hotlinked to the pictures, rather than downloading them to your PC and uploading to you blog, then it's easy for them to perform a trackback on anyone linking to their pictures.
