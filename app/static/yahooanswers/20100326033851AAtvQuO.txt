Why does my browser (Firefox) start to have a delayed reaction after I have it open for an hour or so?
After like an hour or so I'll try to scroll or move the curser or type something and it will freeze for like a second before it reacts. I'll close and restart it and it will be fine, but then after an hour the same thing happens.

Firefox is a memory hog and certain extensions are prone to memory leaks - keep task manager open and see the memory usage shoot up over time

Try to keep the number of tabs open to a minimum and get rid of any extensions you don't use anymore however "cool" they may be.

Or try Google chrome!
