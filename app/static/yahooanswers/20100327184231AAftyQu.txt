Should I get Internet Explorer 8?
I currently have Internet Explorer 7 and I was thinking about getting 8 but I don't know if it is worth it. I am also not sure if it has any bugs in it. Any help is appreciated! Thanks!

Nuuu! GET GOOGLE CHROME! It's so much better.
Id recommend Mozilla Firefox, but if you like internet explorer, go ahead. Here is the firefox download link http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/.
Yes, internet explorer has the craziest speeds it whoops the shit out of google shit chrome or fireassholefox..
IE8 has many bugs, I recommend Mozilla Firefox.
I've used IE for several years but recently switched to Google Chrome a few months ago. G. Chrome is much faster, cleaner and less buggy....
IE8 is great! I have been using IE in one form or another for 15 years!
I use Google Chrome at home. At work, I accidentally upgraded to IE8, and now the web-based application I have to use to take attendance and enter grades crashes every IE window I have open, every time I try to use it. Eventually, I'll have to uninstall it and reinstall an earlier version. In the meantime, I've been using a different computer to take attendance.
In all reality, IE7 and IE8 aren't all that different and won't offer that much difference in terms of functionality.  IE8 just has a few more new features (like compatibility mode, which is nice), but is it absolutely worth upgrading to?  No, not really.  I upgraded to IE8 to stay current and have not had any problems with it (no bugs).  So it's really up to you on whether or not you should upgrade.  There just really isn't much difference between the two versions.

Others on here have recommended that you switch to Firefox or Google Chrome.  If you are interested, either one is a fine browser and is quite a bit faster than IE, but if you want to change, I would recommend Firefox over Chrome.  Chrome is way too over simplified and I've found Firefox to be slightly faster.

Hopefully this helped.
