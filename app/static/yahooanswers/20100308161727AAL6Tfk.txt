What is lockerz redemption?
I have recently joined lockerz and have enough points for a 360 game. Everything is out of stock. how do i buy stuff? i also heard something about redemption. whats that??/

yeah i joined too i wanna get a psp. a redemption is where they restock everything and it only lasts for about 10 minutes so you gotta be quick.
