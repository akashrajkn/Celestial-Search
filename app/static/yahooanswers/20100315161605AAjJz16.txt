Internet Explorer users, how do you like internet explorer?


It's fine. I've never ever really had any major problem with it.
Piece of worthless, nonconformist trash.

Oh, users of. I haven't used it since version 5.2.3.

Screw that, it's a piece of worthless nonconformist trash. It can't even do HTML5.
well i used to use it but i use google chrome. i am not lying but it is very stylish and quicker. it also has some cool tricks and shortcuts :)

i fin'd ie on my pc slow :(
sucks because Microsoft sucks and it always says windows updates just downloaded! and i be like naaa you just did that 3mins ago so i install and restart and green symbol come up and say your protected! then it'll come up and say new updates available and i be like naaaaaa
HATE, HATE,HATE , HATE DID I SAY HATE !
Don't really like it that much. I switched to Chrome because of it's problem. Visiting sites, it sometimes become unresponsive and I have to force close it. It doesn't auto block sites that forces you to visit another site that tries to upload a virus into the computer. It also loads pages so slow and takes a bit to open a new tab.
Internet explorer is okay, but it is sort of slow and dull with Safari and Mozilla out there. If you need a reliable browser go for Google Chrome!
