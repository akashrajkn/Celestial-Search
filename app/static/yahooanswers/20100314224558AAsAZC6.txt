What should I use my domain name for?
I have domain name 'be1.cc'. What should I make the website do or be?

You got a domain without first deciding what to do with it. Awesome...
You could turn it into an advertising site and charge advertisers money for advertising there.

Belgium?
World of Warcraft Blood Elf?
Biomedical Engineering?

A redirect to another website or something?

Hope this helps.
You dont need to have a website.
You can have it registered like you have done to get it off the market and use it in future if you need to or sell it through eg Sedo.
