Does the new web browser internet explorer 8 that is included with my new computer is better ?
My parents bought me an brand new HP Desktop Computer back on the black friday sales to replace my old 2001 dell dimension desktop computer. I actually love my new HP computer better because it more reliable and is faster and much better and because it has the recovery option disk just in case you have a problem and you have to reinstall windows, it would restore it to the factory image settings. Dell doesn't have the recovery option which would result in a complete loss of your factory image settings like your games that the factory installed and your burning softwares and stuffs. But the new computer has Windows 7 which is better than Windows Xp, it has the new Internet Explorer 8 which it says is more secured and better but is it better than the previous version of Internet Explorer 7 ??? Do you think Internet Explorer 8 is better than the previous version ?? My father still has Windows XP so he uses Mozilla Firefox but everytime he gets on my computer he is saying wow ! about Internet Explorer 8. So has Internet Explorer 8 appears to be better ?? I actually prefer it more so i uninstalled Firefox on my new computer. I also have a laptop that i use for college that also has Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista. My new computer my parents bought it as a bundle with the monitor for only $348.00.

IE8 and Firefox are generally very similar. You actually answered your own question. You deleted Firefox.

If you mean IE8 vs IE7, yes much better & safer. 

If you mean IE8 vs Firefox, I've always had 2 browsers, and sometimes 3. They each have their strengths & I use them both. I'm going to add Chrome this weekend if I have the time to play with it.
