Is this possible to get a single internet broadband connection for our 60 offices in India?
Hi,
Our company is having 60 offices all over India. All offices having internet broadband connection separately. Is this possible to get a single connection for all offices? So that we can pay a single bill monthly or yearly once. Also we can reduce our cost. Any suggestion plz

Contact your broadband provider.

They can design a WAN.
to do this,you have to contact with your ISP(Internet service provider).Also you have to spent some extra money to setup your own server.
