How do you ask people questions on formspring without them knowing who asked it?
Do you need to logout or something?

No, you just select the option that you want it to be anonymous
You don't need to logout because there's an option that asks whether you want to ask from your profile or do it anonymously. If you don't see that option, then yeah, logout and then ask the person.
