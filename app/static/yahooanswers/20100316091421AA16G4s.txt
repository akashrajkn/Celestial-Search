I keep getting followed by people associated with PLR. Should I block them?
My business Twitter account has received multiple follows the last few days from people associated with PLR (Private Label right) content websites. Should I block them? They seem spammy. If they are, I don't want to be associated with them. Thanks! Dan

block any thing and any one whos you are not comfortable at all from your twitter, or even your LIFE.

there is a old proverb it says : when you don't have headache why should you take peals !!!!

You can block them by protecting your tweets.In this way they'll have to send a request to follow you.Then in the friends request you can decide which guys you should allow and which you shouldnt.


The same is happened my friends twitter account.He's  a business owner and used to get followers who are business owners.







I hpoe this helps

P.S: you can protect your tweetes in settings of your homepage
