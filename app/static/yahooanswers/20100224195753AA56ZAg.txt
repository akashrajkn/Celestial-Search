Lockerz Redemption!!!!?
Is lockerz worth getting ptz on? I only have 108 ptz and my friend told me that it's really hard prizes and redemptions only last a few minutes and are always out of stock.

sometimes it is ok to go on lockerz i go on everyday it gets boring but it might be worth it i always try getting sumtin but usually never get it but last redemption i got a 25 dollar paypal card it gets boring to gon everyday but i find it worth it i have 982 pointz so if u have time go on u still might get frustrated during the redemption so if u have time and is calm do it


the member redemption is tomorrow
the general redemption is friday
It's not that hard to get points now. Visit the play section in lockerz.
P.S.  I Have 400+ Ptz.
100 of them are from playing in the play section ( took about 15 kins to get them)
HONESTLY,
NO
