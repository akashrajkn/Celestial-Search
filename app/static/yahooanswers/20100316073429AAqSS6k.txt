why is my mobile internet always switching off?
my laptop is on network 3 on pay as you go but always turns off after a few minutes...HELP!!!

Your mobile internet always switching off because it catches virus toooooo fast!!!!!!!
sounds like a weak signal, try a new location
My be you have to buy another one.
It's either a bad dongle or you live in a very bad reception area.

It only has to drop to about 1 or 2 bars on the strength meter and it will cut off.
