What is "Screw you Emily" webiste?
I see it links on Facebook all the time it the website and just wondering what it is.

It is a website that a guy made to get revenge on his girlfriend. While they where still together he got some pictures of her... and he put those on the website when she cheated on him. The reason it is all over facebook is because you have to "unlock" the pictures, by getting other people to click your link. Basically it's a porn website that makes people spam the internet with the link, making it very popular.
^^ The Person Above Said It All. But It's COMPLETLY Fake. Here's The Disclaimer From The Website To Prove It:
