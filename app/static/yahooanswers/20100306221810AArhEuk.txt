My mom is making ablog about and we need names?
facial masks homemade, homemade cleaning products, recipes

homemade beauty products, cleaning products, and recipes


any ideas for a name?

Will i get half of the profits if i help with a name?
mayve relate it to beauty, or a family name or try to summarise what the website will include in just a few words and try make something from that maybe with a catchy pun
Naturals with Natalia, home made...
I had the same problem when I was starting my own blog about making money online, which I finally settled on BlogStash.com which has nothing to do with money making, but I think it has a nice tun to it and its easy to remember.

So how about:

HomeMadeulous     
you know, like fabulous meaning using your beauty supplies makes one looking homemadeulous (fabulous)

Home Made House Keeping

Home Made Beauty

Home Made Beauty supply(s)

Home Made Clean

Home Made Recipes

I hope these will give you some ideas. I wish you and your mom the best of luck.
