Question about Paypal fees?
I buy from ebay regularly. I use paypal to pay for the items. I have my bank account linked to paypal and they have my bank debit card # also. When I pay for items, paypal uses my debit card to charge my bank account i suppose. Anyway do they charge fees?

Only if you receive money!
No, I don't think they do. Only when you are using the Funds on your Paypal account to send money to some one they charge you.

Even if they do, its only like 40 cents.
