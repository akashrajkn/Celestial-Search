Why are my tweets disappearing?
Just recently my tweets got cut out and won't show up. Yesterday I was at 224 tweets, today I'm at 204 tweets. Why is this happening? O.o
Is it going to stop soon? O.o

HAcked!!!
you're not being hacked, twitter is doing this to the majority of people as of late
but they haven't been doing anything about it.
