IP Address issue, help?
Alright, so i teamviewed my girlfriend, controlled her computer from mine, i dont know if shes saying the truth or not, but she claims she is at Laredo Texas now to visit me, but its been a while she still doesnt even come to my house bringing a lot of reasons to not come and im starting to think shes making this up, so anyways i teamviewed my girlfriend and checked her IP address just to see her location and it says shes in Florida (where she lives) my question is, does whatismyipaddress.com take a while to update the real ip or something? by the way, she is on a laptop, and im extremely curious where shes really at.

Never trust one sources of IP tracking. If you try other IP locations site's then you can compare results and see of there are differents.

 I prefer always to find location of IP addresses with:
http://www.ipaddresslocation.org
http://www.find-ip-address.org
