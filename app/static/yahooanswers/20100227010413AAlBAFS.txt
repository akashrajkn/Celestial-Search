WHY DOES CHATROULETTE FREEZE WHEN YOU CHAT?
i've talked to so many awesome people and hate it because my computer freezes every time i chat longer than 10 minutes. why is this?? i have a brand new hp laptop with windows 7.

It is your internet, it cannot sustain a chat/cam with a foreign server for over 10 mins. This is probably due to speed, location, quota or even your firewall.

Most of these can be fixed easily. Some cant though

Are you sure it's your computer, as it may be the chatroulette server crashing. Also what browser are you using? Try switching to firefox or chrome as there may be a memory leak in the browser.
OMG i have the same problem too and i have a new hp laptop and windows 7 also! it's so frustrating o_o
i don't know, i got an hp laptop too (windows 7) and it freezes all the time, and it takes forever to get a new partner.
this happen all the time. I already download google chrome but it's the same thing. try disabling your firewall maybe it would work. good luck
