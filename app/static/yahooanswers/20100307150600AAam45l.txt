My netbook browser says its needs to be updated, I have internet explorer?
btw I know for a fact I have interet explorer, I needed to know a link where I can download IE 8 for windows CE version 6

I guess Microsoft skimped on the UI on CE and didn't automatically provide a link to update your software.

Why do people use that crap???
hello you can download from this site here
