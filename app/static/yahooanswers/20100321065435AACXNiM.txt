when watching programs on internet?
when watching programs on the internet the picture is slightly out of focus how can i get it to be a perfect picture

haha "out of focus". 
They're not out of focus, that is just the quality of the video file, some are good quality and some are not.
If I take a picture of something and it is out of focus then it will be out of focus for everyone.
There is nothing you can do about it. What is transmitted is as is.

If it's crap quality to begin with then you will receive crap quality.

However if you are watching it with your nose about a foot from the screen then it will be slightly out of focus. 

A computer monitor screen isn't any different to a TV screen and if I remember correctly from way back it was recommended you divided the screen size by 4 and turned it into feet.

So if you are watching on a 20" screen then you should be at least 5' away from it.
