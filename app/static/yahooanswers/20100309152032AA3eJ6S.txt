Which of these is more disturbing 2 Girls 1 Cup or The Offended Page on Encyclopedia Dramatica?
I've seen both and my friend and I disagree mainly out of bias. I like ED and he doesn't. So which one and if you can explain why is more disturbing to see 2 Girls 1 Cup or The Offended Page on ED?

Both are disgusting.
Easily The Offended Page. 

I find mutilated penisues, decaptiated heads, blended animals, burnt cats, and crushed skulls with brains exposed a lot more disgusting then some acting.
