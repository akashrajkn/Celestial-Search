How Do You Blend Colors On Witty Profiles?
If you use or have use witty profiles i would like how to know how to blend colors?

very easily. i would go to everlongs_layouts page ( http://www.wittyprofiles.com/author/everlongs_layouts ) and you can copy and paste any of the many fades she has up there. when you have it copied into where you want it,  all you have to do is highlight the letter the first letter and WITHOUT BACKSPACING it, type the new letter that you want. this should create a fade.  If you have any questions, comment my profile:
