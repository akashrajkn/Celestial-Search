Why do domain names cost money? Do they REALLY have to be managed by FOR-PROFIT organizations?

EDIT: "Impossible"? Why exactly can't a non-for-profit like Wikimedia do it?

If there was no regularization of the issue and registration of domain names, the Internet would be in total chaos.  It costs money to register a domain name with the appropriate authorities, and it costs money to maintain the service offered by the domain name provider.
You may think the Internet is a magical free place, but there are actual people behind every website, and in the case of websites providing some sort of service, these people are actual workers who actually want paying.
If domain names were free, then every single possible domain name would have been taken by somebody.  dkeroudneireuroeddouflsudeouid.com?   Sorry, been taken by some guy in Khazakstan.  The domain holder will sell it to you for $50, though.
Jim is right. Wikimedia does not give away free domain names.
Not only for Profit..They must need some Money to Manage the Domain names,also providing the license etc..Without money it's not possible...So that they offers money..some Domain name registration company needs Profit in registration of Domain Names..In the site http://www.tucktail.com/ You can get the Domain Name registration at low cost....I registered there.
It is a service and takes a lot to manage.
Eg registering, transferring.
