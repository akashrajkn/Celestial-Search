How do some webmasters embed Yahoo answers of their websites?
I've noticed a number of websites that have embedded Yahoo Answers on their pages - obviously an easy way to add content - but I see nothing in the Yahoo site that offers embedded links such as the ones on YouTube - is html available?.

They add a Yahoo badge to their website.  Follow these instructions to get to Yahoo's advice on how to create a badge:

1. Click "My Activity" at the top of the page.
2. In the "Share my knowledge" section at the bottom right of the page click "badge page".

The page offers different badges to display. You should find what you are looking for.
