Can Xbox Netflix accounts be shared?
My friend has Xbox Live and it comes with Netflix. He can watch streaming movies on his Xbox and has an online Netflix account. Is there any reason I wouldn't be able to log onto his internet Netflix account and then watch movies on m computer?

He's okay with it.

I Dont think they can...Im sorry bro
I dont think that would be a problem, I have logged on to my twitter account before on my friends Xbox
You can have instant watch with Netflix on 5 different machines including computers and xbox/PS3

So you should be fine.
