Have forums like this and social networking become just an excuse for mean/angry people to mistreat others?
I'm thinking if you know what I mean, I probably don't need to elaborate.
KL:  Am I supposed to take that as ironic?  I mean, was it meant to be humorous?

Yes.  What a stupid question.
Not really, it's done so much more than that.  But hiding behind anonymity certainly does bring to light, certain social aspects one wouldn't usually encounter in normal face to face conversations.
Yes, there are a lot of nuts around who would not have the courage to say out loud the things they write.
