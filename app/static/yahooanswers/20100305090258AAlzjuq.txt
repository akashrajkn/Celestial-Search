what are the best internet browser> and why ?
i am asking about best browser to use it

Safari or Chrome.

WebKit is the BOMB.
Firefox or Chrome. IE and Safari suck.
Firefox

Mainly because firefox has is so easy to use, and for some reason (for me) goes faster! If you have any questions with it, there is so much support on the internet.
In my opinion firefox is the best, and I use Adblock and Youtube Video Downloader plugins. Unfortunately I still have to use IE for work, as our intranet uses a lot of scripting and activex that don't work with firefox.
Chrome. Google Chrome, have you heard of google before? That's why.
Firefox and SeaMonkey.Both developed at Mozilla.
Microsoft IE 8
Avant 
Opera
Google Chrome
Maxthon
IE8 because it works will ALL websites!
IE is slow and clunk.  Plagued by pop-ups and security flaws.

Firefox is faster, has great applications.  Safer then IE.  Almost no pop-ups.

Chrome is the fastest, most streamlined and the one I use now.  Now has applications  similar to Firefox but it is a fairly new feature and still needs work. Overall, I'm the happiest with Chrome.
Google Chrome. Definitely. It's fast, simple and secure.

After Chrome, Opera, as it includes loads of great features - but if all you want is to surf the net and check out all your favourite websites dead quick, there is no need, so use Chrome.

After Chrome, Safari, because it's quite fast, but it doesn't look good in Windows.

After Safari, Firefox. I suppose it's quite secure, it does the job. Nothing special though. And for me, it can't control much more than a 3d game.

I strongly suggest you stay away from Internet Explorer. It is slow and very insecure.
Chrome and the newly released Opera 10.5 are THE best.
Opera 10.5 is the fastest browser along with chrome..It also sports a great number of features.
Chrome is just soo simple and fast.
Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera

Basically anything except internet exploder
