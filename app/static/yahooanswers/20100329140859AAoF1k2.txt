There are several sites I found that allow you to upload your picture to virtually try on hair. If you're not comfortable with that though, you can pick a model that generally looks like you and try hair on her.

Oh and the Garnier site might have what you are looking for as far as changing hair color. Sorry If I didn't get it. :) Im not sure what the last link looks like but it should let you try on highlights etc.
