My AOL account was terminated and i need help?
my AOL account was terminated i called and said i need to write a letter for it to be reviewed. now i have a few questions regarding that:
1. if i actually write back do they tell my the exact reasons why it was terminated like the actual thing that caused it not just "voilation of rules" 
2. can i get my account recovered if they review and decide to give it back
3. if they do decide to recover and let me stay with aol would my stuff be deleted or no
