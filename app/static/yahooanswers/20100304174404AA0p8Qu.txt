is it weird if you chat roulette alone?
i've never done it and wanna see what the fuss is all about, but people tell me they do it in groups....

You can put a video or an image instead of your web-cam to try it without showing your real face

And most people I saw on Chat Roulette were alone. It is because they are alone, they are doing this :)

Just don't do weird stuff, because someone can record you and put onto youtube

Don't do it alone. 
Don't even do it in a group.
Just don't do it.
You'll either be asked to show your privates, or someone else will forcefully show you theirs. That's what happens 90% of the time. Its mostly a bunch of old creeps and horny underaged boys. You'll probably be scarred for life after you see some of the disgusting and scary things people do on there.
