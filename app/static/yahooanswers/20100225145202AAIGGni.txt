Can I use Firefox internet without internet explorer?
Do I really Need internet explorer in my windows? I use firefox more than often (safer). Is it ok to just deinstall internet explorer?

You don't need Internet Explorer. You can uninstall it. It's just a browser, and a terrible one at that.
yeah u can and now u can also giv me best answer well done thanks wooo
yes you can remove internet explorer but you should keep it as a  back up.
yes it is a stand alone program...i don't know why you would think otherwise
absolutely
Yes totally safe to do that.

you might need Internet explorer when you want to perform windows updates but if you set your updates to download and install automatically then you are good.
you can use any internet browser alongside that appauling excuse of a browser IE.

Simply download the new browser and once complete it will add a new desktop icon, when you want to connect to the internet click the new icon for that browser and away you go.

IE should have come with a caveman suit and club its that prehistoric.

no point uninstalling IE though as its very handy to check websites on 2 browsers for example 

www.splashtastic aquatics.net in firefox looks great.

then look at it in IE ( piece of gr &&&(I(YUGKUCVYXV)
No it's best to leave it on your pc,some sites need IE for updates etc.It can make your pc behave erractically as well if you uninstall it.Just leave it and forget it
mozilla is much betterr.
You can choose to have Firefox as your browser when you download it and Firefox will remove IE
Hi some programs that you may use in the future, use Internet explorer by default.So personally I would hang on to it, just in case.
Defintely OK to remove IE.
It depends what you use Microsoft for e.g. you cannot go directly to Microsoft Update site and download updates and IE is also required to run the Microsoft online scanner without having to install special add-ons to Firefox.
