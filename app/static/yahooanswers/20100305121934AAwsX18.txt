I want to pass some time, does anyone know any good websites to go on to do so?
I've run out of ideas on what to do, nothing is happening on facebook etc. I dont mind game sites, but they bore me after a while.. I quite like online games where people from around the world play on. But I dont mind anything which is quite cool and interesting which will grip me for a few hours. :)

Yahoo Answers.
listverse always grabs my attention.
Porn Hub.  Look in the fetishes category.  Or the BBW.
