Mozilla Firefox Won't Open?
My firefox was not responding so I closed it and now when I try to open it this comes up:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
<key id="manBookmarkKb" key="&bookmarksCmd.commandkey;" command="Browser:ShowAllBookmarks" modifiers="accel,shift"/>
----^

and that's it.

What can I do to fix it? I'm only on the internet now because I am using Internet Explorer. Please help! Thanks!

Reinstall 'FF' Firefox. http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html?utm_source=gsnippet&utm_content=ga36&utm_campaign=s170110
Try to uninstall FireFox and download it again from monzilla.com
Try reinstall it it should fixed it, or you should use google chrome or ie8.
Use Safari
A whole lot faster than Firefox.
