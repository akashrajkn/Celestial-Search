Suddenly I can't log into my AIM account anywhere?
I use the latest version of iChat when I use AIM, and it was working just fine last night, and suddenly, I'm getting an error that my username/password is incorrect and unrecognized on iChat, Mail, AIM.com, AOL, etc. I'm absolutely positive no one hacked into my account, either. All my other accounts work just fine. What's going on?
Okay, okay, I get it.
And I did search before posting. All the topics were from 2-4 years ago, so I assumed it was just me.

Yeah, everyone seems to be reporting problems with AIM right now. If you'd actually searched, you'd know that.
it's happening to everyone else with an aol/aim screenname, aol is probably updating it's site or having technical difficulties, i'm sure it will be solved shortly you'll just have to wait it out.
It has to be a problem with aim, because you just posted this question 6 minutes ago, and aim is doing the exact same thing with me. I guess we'll just have to wait for somebody somewhere to fix aim.
Yeah, me too. 

*seethes*



EDIT - seems to be working now, try again
so is mine and i thought someone hacked into it!!! thanks for making sure i wasnt the only one.... :) im not sure how long this is going to last but i hope it doesn tlast too long!
I'm having the same exact problem. I tried my account on my iPod and the computer and it still didn't work. I even deleted my AIM app and got a new one, but still the same thing is happening. I researched on the Internet and it said alot of people were also having trouble. One source said that AOL was probably having connection issues and in a few hours the accounts would be back.
