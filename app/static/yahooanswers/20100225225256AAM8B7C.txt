Why is my firefox doing this.?
I use mozilla firefox, and the other day i opened up a new browser and i got this
"Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.ask.com
*   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the web"

And i even deleted the file and redownloaded it and it still says that.

Anyone know what i can do to fix it?

Oh and the ask.com is what pops up whenever i open a new browser.
I just did what you told me to do and i still get what i've been getting.

You either 1) need to adjust your firewall options in firefox and your firewall or 2) You're having computer network problems
your network settings have been compromised.

Try:   Tools - Options - Advanced - Network - Connection - Settings

If you are the usual internet user, it should be set to "no proxy"

Any other setting should be reset to "no proxy".

If you use a server (unlikely), then the network points to the server for internet access.
