Proxy-VPN and hotspot shield for Vista x64?
Ok so I'm in China and here for the next few years... I'm trying to get a free working proxy for Vista x64 but I can't seem to find anything! I recently read that Hotspot Shield would now work for Vista x64 but it's a complete fail on my end. Yes zend2 and vtunnel do work, but it's not exactly key because movies and short clips will not work.

So does anyone know a proxy that might work? (I've also used Tor but I might as well be back on a dial-up connection when using it..)
