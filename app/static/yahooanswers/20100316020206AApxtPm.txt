yes, he will recieve your @ replies even if you arent following each other
The '@' symbol is used to make sure that the answer reaches the person whom you are referring to.. So ...
He will still get it. In order to see your @ messages you have to click the @YourUserName in your right sidebar. If you click there you will see the one you sent to yourself.
