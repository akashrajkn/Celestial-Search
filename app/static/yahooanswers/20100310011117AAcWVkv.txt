how do you choose your best answer?
I FOUND AN ANSWER I WANT TO CHOOSE FOR MY BEST BUT I DNT KNOW HOW.... HELP!!

give it a couple of days and it will ask you to choose if you revisit the question in you asked questions in your profile
If you wait four hours after you ask, buttons appear where you can select and rate the answer along with providing comments.
You need to wait 4 hours before you can vote for best answer. a blue button will show under each answer. Choose your best answer and click the blue button under it. You then can rate with 1-5 stars and leave a comment. You will get 3 points for voting. You have up to four days to vote before it goes to a community vote.

If its an other members question that you want to vote on you need wait for 4 days or more then go back to the question and vote you will get 1 point for voting.

You need to be on level 2 (250 points) or above to be able to give thumbs up/down
4 hours after posting your question, go to 'my questions' in your profile and choose the question. if there is an answer there that you think deserves best answer, click the 'choose as best answer' button. (the button will only appear after 4 hours)
Your question must stay open for at least four hours.  Once you submit you open questions, wait four hours.  Then go to your profile page.  About half way down the page you will see 4 tabs with the headings; My Answers, My Questions, My Starred Questions, My Watch List.  Click on the tab labeled "My Questions," it should be the second tab.  You questions will appear and list in the order you submitted them, most recent one first.  It should already say in bright orange letters "Choose Best Answer," Once you click on the question your answers will list and as long as each answer has a blue tab under it you just click the answer you want to vote.  Now if after 4 hours this option does not appear than you have a problem.
