how can i disable flash adverts without impairing my access 2 websites. i'm absolutely sick of adverts nibblin?
g away trying to hijack my attention.
its like a bunch of piranas insidiously  eating away your mind.

If you have Firefox, you should get the add-on called "AdBlocker". Then, whenever you see an ad, just use AdBlocker to disable it. You can also let AdBlocker turn off on certain sites, etc.
Imagine having to pay to go on every website you visit.
Every website costs money to set up and maintain.  The money has to come from somewhere.
You are accessing the site for free, so it is the ads that pay for the site
