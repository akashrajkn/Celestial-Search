Any domain name suggestions?
I am in the process of rebuilding my photography / image editing business website and have decided upon a change of domain name. I have several ideas floating around in my head, but would welcome some suggestions:-) The domain shouldn't exceed 10 characters. It should be catchy and memorable and preferably something that could be expanded to establish an overall site identity - in terms of logo's, banners etc.

Cheers.
