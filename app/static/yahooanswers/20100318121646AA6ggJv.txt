Whats with isohunt.com these days?
i've tried opening isohunt.com these days... a month ago it was not opening, showing network connection timed out.... then after some days it was fine again....
now that problem is again coming.. its not opening.... could you please tell me as to what the the problem is?
because probably there is no other site great as isohunt.com.. not even thepiratebay.org... as such i would be very obliged if anyone could tell why is isohunt.com not opening?

Hi,

I just open the isohunt site 4hrs back. It is working fine.

May be it is the problem with conncetivity and the dataload in ur IE(or anyother browser).

Clear the cache and all. Try it again. If you still getting error. Reinstall the browser again.
