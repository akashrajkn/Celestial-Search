Firefox won't open even though Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome all will.?
Any insights to why this is?

reboot.
If firefox crashed it leaves a portion of itself running and you can't see it. 
If you are pc savy you can go to task manager\processes and look for firefox and kill it.
If that is not the issue then reinstall firefox. They came out with a new update.
Just keep using Safari...A new update may come soon with several performance boosts!! 
so just use Safari :-)
