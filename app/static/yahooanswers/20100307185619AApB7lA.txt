When does Lockerz get more prizes in?
Is there a day that the get stuff in or is it random? I'm new and have enough points to get a game, but they never have stuff in stock. When do they get stuff?

Once per month usually. They let you know approximately when ahead of time. In February, they said really early that they would have one SOMETIME that month, then it ended up being the 25th, a few days after a private wave that you had to spend points to get into.
Lockerz is ok but join swagbucks they have prizes in all the time and it is a good website to get free prizes also. Join up on the link below and start searching to win swagbucks.

I do not like lockerz, I am not a member, however I have watched their members on their facebook wall and everyone was complaining that there their gifts are always out of stock.
My suggestion is to sign up for swagbucks if you want to earn money for searching, Here is a link to sign up:
