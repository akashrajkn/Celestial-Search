Can you give some ideas for creating a fun website?
poems,jokes,love,video,music,etc


how do i make it all in one???

do u know basics of web design .
you need to host a website develop it and upload via ftp server all that stuff?

if u don't know then contact me any time as i am too a web designer trainee.
web.prateekrana@gmail.com

if u know all this then you can use css html combined or if u know advance languages like php and javascript or asp.net u can do that.

create a menu bar at top after giving heading and image for header then use links in menu bar which may be pull down menu
just do it about something you really love and you'll automatically be able to write good content and have the desire to expand it

use a site builder such as stingesitebuilder.com which makes creating a website really easy
