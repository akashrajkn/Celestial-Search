Can someone find you by picture?
I was very skeptical of a site called "chatroulette" where you can vid with people. i was stupid and decided to try it out. well i got paired with a perv older man who was jacking off on camera! I've been to all of those internet safety classes and stuff, but am really creeped out by this. Could he find my from a pic of my face and hunt me down? I'm very nervous. I know I should'nt have gone on that site...

there's a yes, and a no. Yes people can find you by picture on chatroulette map, but it's only if your on chatroulette at the time. i know this because i cant find my pic when I'm offline. chatroulette map is a map of everyone who is online, but you have to click on the location to view the pic. so don't worry, there's more than 20,000 users a day, so going through every country, then state, then city, then street address just to see your picture would be a waste of time. just relax, if you didn't tell anyone where your from, then your safe. EDIT:: your picture does stay up there even offline, i hate to be the bringer of bad news but i just saw my pic and I'm not on chatroulette, but again trying to search through everywhere just to find your pic is ridiculous so again you really don't have anything to worry about.

chatroulette is supposed to be a fun place, but unfortunately its turned very sour and gross.
ChatLack.com is like chatroulette but with photos instead of webcam.
How do you find stored images from chatroulette?
