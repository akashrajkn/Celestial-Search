if you cant see anything that says that they arent what shall i say to prove that i can use them and they are copyright free? i have already tried emailing the owner of the site but he hasnt replied. he hasnt been on it since 2008

It says right on the bottom of his homepage:

If he wont answer, the only thing i suppose you could do is when you use a picture, make sure his link is on it like in the bottom corner.  I don't know that he would sue you for something like that, but he might.
use em but cite them
