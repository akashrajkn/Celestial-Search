formspring is overrated - help.?
is there a way to see who wrote in your formspring? if i write something in someone's, will they ever find out that i wrote in it?

They never will. It's all anonymous. The only way they could tell is if they know your username (if you have one) to the formspring. me site. Hope this helps! (:
