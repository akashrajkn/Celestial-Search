Why do girls always next other girls immediately on chat roulette?


because girls cannot get along.  they are little children at heart.  they cannot stand the thought of even potentially coming across someone with slightly better features, better clothes, a hotter boyfriend, etc.  girls are the main problem with the world.
Its all about control. They want power
the same reason guys next each other
