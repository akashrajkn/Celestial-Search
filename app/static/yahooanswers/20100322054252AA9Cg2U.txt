Why doesn't formspring ever work?
The view "more" questions never works. When you click on following a red note is there stating that its having difficultly. And sometimes formspring itself has an error when trying to access the site!

What is the deal? Everyones complaining.
@ Ching Chong: Have some maturity.

It is a fairly new website, and the increase in traffic is probably hitting their servers pretty hard. I'm sure eventually they will get the issues ironed out.
