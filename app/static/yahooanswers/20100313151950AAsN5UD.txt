Toolbar help on internet explorer?
I don't know how, but the address bar on the toolbar when I open up windows has dissappeared. Its been like this for a while, and when I right click and re-add the address bar, it only comes up as a grey letters 'Address' on the right side of the toolbar. Also, idk if this is linked to it, but if someone gives me a link to a website I can't access it. How can i fix this?

You must be using the very old Internet Explorer 6 ?

First you must unlock the Toolbars then you must right-click, grab and drag the dotted "Move Bar" that is to the left of 'Address'. Then extend it as desired.

It is tricky and takes some practice.

The full procedure is here...just click it:

When done, just be sure and "Lock the Toolbars" again.
