Music and video storing websites?
I have a crapload of music and video files that are slowing down my computer. Are there any good, safe file storing sites that allow music and video upload? Sort of like a Photobucket for vids?

Why not just burn all your files into DVD for saving? 

Personally, I think it is a saft and nice way for saving all the download music and video files.

I can recommend you a all-in-one burning tool, iSkysoft DVD Creator. it can burn all the things you have into to DVD for saving.

Go get a MobileMe account from Apple and upload everything. If not, go spend $70 and purchase an external hard-drive.
I use iSkysoft DVD Creator to burning all my downloaded movies into DVD for saving for a long while, and it always works well for me.
