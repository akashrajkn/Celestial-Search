can my future in sera-fedra.com be true or is it some kind of cheating business anyway i gave my details?


Oh, I'm almost afraid to ask what "sera-fedra.com" is.  I couldn't get such a website to come up, but it sounds like a fortune-telling scam intended to get your personal information.  Depending on what you gave up, I suggest you take defensive action immediately.

Good luck, and next time, ask questions like this before giving anything away.
