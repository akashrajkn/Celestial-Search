How to get Firefox's address bar to show up again?
My little sister came into my room when I wasn't looking and screwed with the keyboard; leading to Firefox looking a bit plainer than usual with the result of a missing address bar and no toolbars.  Help?

There should be a "oval-looking" button in the right corner of the window. Click it. :)
Try F11 I believe that key will bring back the toolbars.
hit the F11 key
put the mouse pointer on top and right click uncheck hide tool bar
Is it in full screen mode? Try pressing escape, Ctrl Alt Delete (if in Windows), or F11.
Go to the top of you Firefox Browser and right Click it. Check on the menu bar and the Navigation bar.
This should get it back to where you were.
Press Alt and F at the same time to open the File menu. Move your mouse over to View then Toolbars then Navigation.

Choose Navigation and it should reappear.
Hold down the {ALT} key ({Cmd} key in OSX) and press the following letters in this exact order: V T M 
The Menu Bar should now be displayed permanently, unless you turn it off again (View > Toolbars). Turning the Menu Bar on and off is a new feature in version 3.6. 
See other bars under View > Toolbars. Click on one of them will place a check mark (display) or remove the check mark (not displayed). 
To display the Status Bar, View, then click Status bar to place a check mark (display) or remove the check mark (not displayed).

hope it helped !
