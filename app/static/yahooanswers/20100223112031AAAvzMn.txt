FireFox or Internet Explorer 8?
Just curious what everyone's opinion is. I use FireFox and my friend uses IE8. *quick note: just between these two browsers, I don't care for the others* He always complains if I ever mention FireFox. I know IE7 lagged behind against FireFox but I was reading how IE8 is now supposed to be better. Would like some actual facts about the two, not just "I like it."

I use Internet Explorer for almost everything, but FireFox is better for streaming movies, so I use both.
Well, IE8 runs each tab in a separate process, so if one tab fails, it doesn't kill your entire browsing session.  Also IE8 seems to render webpages better than Firefox.  Firefox has good plugins though, but I find it crashes randomly a little too often (and I'm not the only one who's noticed this).

Anyway, when it comes to browsers, they're really all good.  It mostly comes down to personal preference and my preference is towards IE8.
Firefox is more stable and secure... but if your using Windoze your still going to have security issues.
Also Firefox has more functions with Add-ons.
I use both. Then if one don't work, try the other.
I've always had 2 browsers, and sometimes 3. They each have their strengths & I use them both. I'm going to add Chrome this weekend if I have the time to play with it.
