What should I use for my Internet Homepage?
Okay.. Im setting up my new laptop and dont know what to use for my welcome home screen.. Please can people leave ideas on what to use..

Firefox : its good tbh
google. That way you can write in whatever you want to go on next.
use this address, whether you like it or not you need to know what's updated on this page, because it's about your planet, your world and maybe it has some thing which may impact your daily life
st it as   http://www.cnn.com
www.google.com
You better go to your browser's tools and find your homepage. Then erase it and type " about:blank. "it's a blank page, which is the best welcoming page. This way it doesn't take long for your browser to load after you have started it. :)
I usually go with google, where I have my mail, or whatever site I frequent the most
Bing.com

Have a new picture every day.

I use Yahoo, then I can always do a quick check of my email before surfing, plus, Yahoo is a search engine, and has news on the front page. :D
use what email page that you use, & then use google chrome..................
