Is there a website to make money working at home?

I didn't ask for any smartdelic comments . Thanks

None that are not a scam in one way or another - think of it this way : If these sites were real, there would not be 20 million people out of work !!!
If there was, there wouldn't be any unemployment.
Sure just get a web cam and make your own, you can call it "<insert your name>'s whore palace" or something like that. The cool thing is it doesn't even matter what you look like. If you are like 500lbs or missing a leg or whatever, there are people out there that will still want to see you naked
yes go to EZ DROPSHIP.COM. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE LOTS OF DOUGH.
work for Chacha or Kgb answering people's text questions. you get paid by the answer and its legit
Why not have a website? See:
http://computereweb.com/wfh-training
they train you for free, show you what to do.
Get into internet marketing, it doesn't have to cost you a cent.
Get a site, get traffic to it (a separate blog might help here) and all sales you generate are yours.
This  is one example: http://job--listings.info/MyFreeAffiliateSite
Lots of luck on that one. You and million-s of other people are looking for the same thing. And for the most part, such "jobs" don't exist. You pay us first is a major warning sign. About the only people who make any real money are those who start their own web site.
