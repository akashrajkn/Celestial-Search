is there anyway to contact formspring to have them shut off your site if you lost your password?
my stupidest decision was to make a formspring, i really need to get it deleted before my mother sees it, i really regret making one i lost my password i can't reset it i keep trying to get it reset the site is a complete joke a failure a girl actually recently commited suicide because of it , the site is horrible

is anyone knows a way i can contact the site through email so i can ask them to delete my page

thanks so much

if you cant delete it from logged in, then just forget about it, its just a load of crap.

anyone who would commit suicide over whats on the internet obviously had a problem beforehand.
i want to do that aswell! its such a pisstake!, it won't send me an email when i request it, the website is a complete load of crap, just try to forget about it for the moment, hopefully formspring will sort it out soon so i can delete the damn thing. :/
