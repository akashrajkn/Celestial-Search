Hi !  looking for a a web mail creator for one of the providers above. i need to make a lot of accounts and do?
im just re posting this question as i have the same problem

Guerrillamail is good if you need to use it to register for a service but don't want to fill in all the details. It gives you 30 mins to use the email which is handy for registering something.
