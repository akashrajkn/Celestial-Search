in firefox, how do you make it so when you push the back button, it goes back to where you were scrolled to?
suppose i scroll down a page a hefty way and click on a link, it goes to the next page and it's not what i want, so i hit back. i want the page to be in the same spot as where i left it, not back at the top.  i looked through all the options but there was nothing close.  i know there is a hidden page of options. i forget where it is but if you type something in the address bar it goes to this page. is there anything on that page that would do it?

What you're thinking of in the address bar only works if there is an anchor in the html code.

If you want Firefox to restore your scrolled position, you have to use an add-on.
