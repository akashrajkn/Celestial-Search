Where can I get paterns for adult baby diapers and clothing for free?
A place online where I can down load paterns and info for sewing adult baby diapers and clothing?

buy a lot at a garage sale?
none that i know of  for the general public, but they are available to members of the adult baby community. Have you asked at any of the adult baby forums? They should be able to help you, and I think one has a tutorial for making them, but it's only available to registered members of the group.
