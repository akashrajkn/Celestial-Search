CollectionStop.com reviews?
I can't find any reviews on this website.

My wife bought me a concert DVD from CollectionStop and, I found a problem with the DVD. I tried it in two different DVD players but still had the same problem.

I have e-mailed the website once already with no reply(I e-mailed them a second time, but, that was only a couple minutes ago) after several days. I have a feeling(but I hope not), my wife was scammed.

So, Has anyone heard of this website?
JohnnyCage, I hope you are right.

It's a large website and i doubt it's a scam, maybe you just have to wait for a response. I personally have never ordered anything from it but deciding from the way it's built and it's size, I doubt it's a scam.
Did you google CollectionStop.com ? There's 50,000 results. They're on eBay, so you can check their rating there.
