Ebay: Can I charge extra becuase I'm posting to Germany?
I've just sold a jacket on ebay but didn't put in the description that I only ship to the UK 
I charged P&P at ?2.50
However the auction has ended and the winners postage address is in Germany, do I just leave it and keep the P&P the same or do I email the seller and say that as it's outside the UK i'll have to charge more?
And if so, how much extra should I charge?

of course you can!
?5 seems right to me, Amazon charge that for shoe to the UK. 
just email them, they'll understand
Yes email your Buyer and explain you will need to charge extra for outside UK
Weigh it and go to the Royal Mail website to get the price
