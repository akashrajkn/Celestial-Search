Lockerz February redemption?
Was the general redemption today laggy? Like the waves from yesterday? was there a lot of traffic or was there no lagging? and were there a lot of prizes left?

fool, there was like 15 seconds to grab an item, i was constantly refreshing, and then all of a sudden, Lockerz stated that they went live, and i clicked on ptz place,
and within 15 seconds, everything was gone
alot of people seriously got nothin
