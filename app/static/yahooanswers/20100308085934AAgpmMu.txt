Does anyone know of a good slideshow/movie maker website?
I was wanting to make a slideshow-movie kind of thing with pictures and videos off my digital cam,is there any sites that you guys know of that are really good? That you can add music to as well,or upload from your computer to add to it?

hi,I don't think there is a good website for making a slideshow which allows you to add music.
I have tried http://animoto.com/  before,which a free ,but later i realize it is so limited in functions and i need pay more for additional features.
So i bought the Wondershare Flash Gallery Factory,check their free trail: http://www.flash-slide-show.com/flash-slideshow-products.html
You can add and edit your background music with this software,hope it helps!
I highly recommend iPixSoft Flash Slideshow Creator, it can help you to make flash slideshow flash banner, slideshow album, photo gallery for web design.

In addition, its official website provides step by step tutorial such as
