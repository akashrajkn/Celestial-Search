Is anyone else having trouble signing into Formspring.me?
It's not allowing me to enter my email address. Even if I type it out I can only type half of it in and then it stops.

i checked mine and it worked perfectly, try restarted the system or logging off, then back on...also check other web pages, are you having trouble with only that website?
