I'm not sure about Safari, but Chrome and Firefox are both good. IE is a barebones browser.
i use Google Chrome, very quick and easy to use.
Safari and Firefox are both good as well.
stay away from internet explorer if you can.
your choice, IE comes with the operating system and would be the default as you won't get updates fro a third party browser like FF or chrome, More than one browser and one has to be designate as default to avoide conflict, so put all three on and see which you prefer? The trick is managing add-ons, they will try to copy each others settings? Me FF is very similar to IE, I just stick with IE8, since migrating to windows 7
Firefox is my choice, it has a lot of great add-ons. these add-ons make firefox really cool.
according to the acid test, firefox is the best. 

Chrome is way faster.
Safari is a sellout.
Internet exploiter is made by a money hungry corporation that feeds on your soul.

...take your pick :)
My choice in below order

Firefox
IE6
Chrome
IE8
If you are using windows;
Chrome
Firefox
Opera
IE8 (where's that 10 foot pole?)

If you are using Linux;
Firefox
Opera
Chrome (it is a beta)

IE is not available for Linux
Have not tried Safari
