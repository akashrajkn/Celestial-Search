Why don't Swagbucks award me when the people who I referred get Swagbucks?
I referred my friend and each time he earns Swagbucks, I don't earn any.  He has not reached the limit of 1,000 Swagbucks, so I don't know why it doesn't work.

You only earn SBs on the Swagbucks site he uses.
Swagbucks said it hasn't been working, but They said they fixed it so it SHOULD be working now.
Make sure he correctly used your sign up link...

Mine is... http://bit.ly/aFTrpV

It can take up too 24 hours to get the swagbucks deposited to your account.
If it still does not work for you.. Sign up with my link and start again.
Or try sending SwagBucks an email and ask them too fix it.
Here are some posibble answers to your question:

1) The person you referred didn't use your  referral link.
2) You may only get Swagbucks when the person you referred wins through searching and no other way.
3) There is a glitch on the Swagbucks system.
4) You have to wait at least 48 hours for your total amount of Swagbucks to update.

If you have proof that the person you referred has earned Swagbucks, and your Swagbucks hasn't updated yet, please contact Swagbucks support at http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-support.

Good luck and have a great day.
