What is the best place to share direct download files?
As torrents are out I'd like to find a place to post direct download links. I have been using http://tehparadox.com but I'm not entirely thrilled with the ability (or inability) to sign up for a new account. I also don't think a forum type setup is the most friendly. (I have an account but want to use my TPB username and the register new account isn't working.)

I like http://www.movies-megaupload.com/ but you can't share on it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for good sharing sites?

oneddl is fairly good.
