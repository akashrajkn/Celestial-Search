I live in a flat and have a mobile phone so do not been a landline?
But would like broadband to watch films etc, what is the cheapest way to do this? do i need to get a landline?

What kind of phone do you have? some phones can do tethering. extra 15$ a month. Like the Droid or Blackberry.
not sure what you mean by "films" but it does ok surfing the net and watching youTube
you do not need a land line for internet access any more. Call Verizon, Time warner or AT&T. I recommend Verizon. If not Verizon go with AT&T.
