Is eBay a trustable site?
is there apart of eBay where you don't purchase from ordinary people but a verified seller? which is trustable? have you used it before and was it trustable? I might purchase something I can't find anywhere else.

The site is safe. Just watch what you do while you're on the site.
yes, if your buying stuff, but if you plan on selling they tend to screw people over (i had just listed like 20 things and then got banned for no reason and still had to pay the listing price)
Yes, I`ve never had a problem with either buying or selling.
Set up a paypal account to be on the safe side, then if you don`t receive your items paypal will refund your money.
Also doing it this way no-one sees your bank or credit card details, they are stored by paypal.
Most people who sell on ebay are safe and trustable. When you are looking at the item then in the top right hand corner it will give a % of good customer feedback. Click on this and read the customers comments that have bought from them before. If they have good comments and a high % then they are most likley very safe. When my mum first started buying from ebay she was very wary, like you but now she knows that it's safe and she buys a lot from ebay.

Hope this helped xx
The site itself is pretty safe.
You are dealing with private sellers who might not be.
All you can do is check the history of the seller, and maybe 
use that pay-pal utility that holds payment until you give notice of satiusfaction.
