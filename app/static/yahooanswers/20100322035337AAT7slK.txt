PayPal please help?!!!!!!!?
I am new to PayPal and linked my debit card yesterday.And they sent me and email saying:Check your card statement and look for a charge from "PayPal" with a 4-digit code next to it.
What is My card statement and where should i find that 4 digit code?
Thanks!:)

check your debit card statement either online or wait for the paper statement to arrive you will then see the code.
WElcome to Pay Pal.  This is only the beginning of confusion and strange e-mails.  Many will be scams not at all from Pay Pal. DO NOT click or agree to anything without contacting Pay Pal first to see if the e-mail is valid.

This e-mail is saying that you have made a purchase which will appear on your bank statement. Did you make a purchase?
