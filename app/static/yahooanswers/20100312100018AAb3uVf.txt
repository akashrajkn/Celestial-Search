If I go into Chatroulette will my picture and address be automatically in Chatroulette MAP?
I mean, if I go into the Chatroulette thing, will my picture and address be automatically available for the world to see??
It's just that there's a new webpage calles CHATROULETTE MAP and shows like google maps the users

If you go into Chat roulette, you will automatically see ugly freaks masturbating.
no, nobody will be able to see anything about your address, but they can however see, your face if you have a webcam plugged in... but that's kinda the point :P
How the hell could they possibly get that information? They can see whatever you put on the cam. That's it. Most people on Chatroulette are exhibitionists gone wild or miscreant little s**ts who just want to show fake feeds of the worst things you can imagine.
