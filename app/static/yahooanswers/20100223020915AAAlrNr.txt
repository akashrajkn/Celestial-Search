What's the best proxy program/thingy to get around blocked websites in your country?
I live in Canada and not everyone seems to be blocked to Pandora.com but anyone with a noticeable Canadian IP address can not use the website. I've been using hotspotshield to get around it and listen to pandora but the advertisements and stuff are annoying and it can slow down my browsing and stuff... 

So my question to you is what is the best way for me to access the website? 

Thanks

hide my ip is the best proxy program around

I think 

Ultrasurf  ( http://www.ultrareach.com/)

and 

JonDo (http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/)  

are the best programs in this field.

Give the Personal VPN, http://www.surfbouncer.com   a try. I use it all over the world to Watch Hulu from the UK, BBC iPlayer from China and have even been watching the Olympics on CTV via their Canadian servers. US only sites are easy and they have servers on both coasts of the US and also in the heartland for best speed.
