cain and abel software?
i've been researching keyloggers but i am hesitant to buy one at the risk of viruses and possibly being traced back. i discovered cain and abel but i am not so computer savvy and i'm not sure what it does exactly. all i know it logs passwords over the LAN line securely. but does it record anything else like conversations, chats, emails, IMs etc.? it seems confusing all the "hashes" (whatever that means) etc. to a smart person it's easy, but can someone tell me as if i am an idiot on how to use it and what it does, and possibly how to install it correctly? there are two computers on this LAN. one a laptop and other desk, neither are macs. thank you
it is safe? do i have to disable antivirus to download it? and how, if i can, send it to a target pc without anyone finding out? and what does sniffing mean? does it mean i do not have to install it on another pc if we use the same router? the same router?

C&A captures packets that travel over a network and then scans these packets for passwords ect ect ect and can even break hashes if given time. it can also poison the routing table to allow it to intercept all packets from users in to its self and then to the default gateway. this allows it to see and what ever the people it is intercepting packets from are doing, including passwords.
