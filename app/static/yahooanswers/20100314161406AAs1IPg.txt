How can i get Apple to stop sending me automatic receipts?
Every single time I download a new app (always free, never a cost) from the store on my iphone, it sends an automatic receipt eventually to my e-mail. It is so annoying. I don't remember ever confirming it to do this. How can I stop this! Please

Set up a new email account, log into your iTunes account and change the email address. You wont get any more notifications on your regular email.
there must be an unsubscribe button somewhere, or if an animated service, it won't know any better so just grin and bare it and delete the unopened mail?
