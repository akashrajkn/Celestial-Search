Try AdBlock for Google Chrome:

it sounds like your infected with adware, run malwarebytes.
why do u care ?
You can't. It's part of the Yahoo page make up.

Also Google is a very basic browser.

The only way you will stop them is to go to Internet Options ? Advanced ? Scroll down to Multi Media ? Take the ticks out of "Show Animations" and Pictures" ? Apply & OK

But then that defeats the whole object because that will affect every web site you go on!
