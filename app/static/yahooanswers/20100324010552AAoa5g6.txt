Last.FM Library Question?
So I've had my last.fm account for a while, and added a bunch of artists to my library at the beginning. I've been trying to figure out how I can add new artists. I'd just like to be able to add them in my list, instead of having to search for them all or whatever. Thanks for any help you can give me. : )
