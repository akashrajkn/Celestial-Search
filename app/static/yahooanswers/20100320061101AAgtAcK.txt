is mobile broadband any good?
My contract ends with AOL next week and I really want a new laptop but can;t afford one at the moment so was thinking about mobile broadband with a free laptop in the offer. But my mate has T-Mobile and it's a nightmare, the pictures are of very poor quality and it's sooo slowly and so bad I'd rather have no internet at all. Just wondering if any of them networks are better or even better than home broadband. 

Thanx :)

Try Cricket it's only $40 a month
It's a lot better than T-mobile & cheaper
I can watch streaming video (YouTube, MySpace etc.) smoothly with mobile broadband.
Assuming you're in the UK, check Vodafone out as their monthly plan offers a mobile broadband speed double any of the others and double the speed of any prepay mobile broadband
Wired is still cheaper and faster (Comcast, Etc.).

Image quality won't be affected by mobile but it will be slower (It will be hard to play multiplayer games online). 

I wouldn't recommend mobile broadband as a replacement for home highspeed unless you travel a lot and need internet everywhere.
Are you in the UK?

If so, go for 3 network. I use it. You actually get free broadband for a year, you top-up like you would a mobile phone [it has a sim card] and you can send texts on it. It has fast connection.

if you are always on-the-go and not a heavy internet user, you can use mobile broadband. but wired internet connection is still faster than wireless.
the O2 one is not to bad at all!
