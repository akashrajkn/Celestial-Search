when a domain expires and the 75-80 days is over after the expiration and nothing has been done....?
no one has paid for it again and all records say it expired 75 days ago TODAY can the register company hold on to it as long as they want?

when do expired domains become available ?

thanks

thats why you either wait or make the company that holds it an offer to buy

it wont be cheap because they know people want to buy it so they hold it for ransom
it costs them nothing holding it so when they make money from it they laugh all the way to the bank
After The expired Period over the Domain name come for resale..If you need to register the Domain name,Transfer the Domain name reach here
