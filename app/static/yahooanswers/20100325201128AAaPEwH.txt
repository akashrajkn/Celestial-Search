I can't download anything from the internet on my computer?
All of a sudden my computer will not let me download anything from firefox. I have always been able to do so. I click on a free download from the internet, and it brings up the download box, but nothing is downloading, and it doesn't leave me a link on my desktop to finish the download. What is wrong? I went into the security tab on firefox and typed in the website in the allow box under exceptions, but that didn't work. I've also tried clearing the cache and everything, but still nothing. Please help me to get the download succesful? Any info will be helpful

You should connect your computer to the Internets and stop downloading viri.

Hi your browser may be effected with the Virus. 
There are many viruses in the internet, which we cant imagine or fine. 
Do one thing Take one CD of Antivirus and Install it in your system. Clean all the System and try to download. Still  if you cant download. Format your system with New OS 
Then install antivirus and try to Use Google Chrome in your system 
Then it should work then onwards.
