Whats the quickest internet browser?
Whats the quickest/best/coolest/fun internet browser. I use firefox an its fast but is there a faster one?

Heard of Google Chrome?
yesss google chrome is amazingly fast. also try mozilla firefox.
google chrome is by fact the fastest but also the most lightweight one meaning addons and options arent that many. but good enough.
for quickest and fun i go for google chrome
for best i go for mozilla firefox
for coolest i go for safari
