Where can I download Alkaline Trio's self-titled album free without signing up?
I used to have the album, but I lost it and I didn't get to import it to my new computer. I intend to buy it again, but right now I'm a poor college student (lol) and I can't afford it at the moment. I just REALLY need it right now. I've exhausted every source I know and I can't find it. I tried getting the songs individually but all I can find are Goodbye Forever, My Friend Peter, and Cooking Wine. If you know where I can get the rest of the songs, too, that would be fine. Just no torrents and only -.zip and -.mp3 extensions; -.wma and -.rar don't work on my computer. Please, please, please, please, please help me!
Nah, shit...really?! Dude, I CAN'T BUY IT RIGHT NOW. If you're not going to give me an answer I can use, DON'T F*CKING ANSWER! It's a waste of my time.

No way, thats illegal.  Less than $10 on Itunes.
