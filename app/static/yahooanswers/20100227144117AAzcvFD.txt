I signed into my paypal & My only credit card, it says is asigned to a different account. Any way to unassign?


Unless you have two paypal accounts, I would think that someone has jacked your card number. You should call customer service on paypal, and if it is an account you don't know, have them unassign it. Then check your bank for unknown charges.
is there a phone number,I would call them up and find out>you will just get a run around doing it over the internet.what gets me is asigned to a different account,meaning what,like some-one else signed in?        good luck. it also might for the best call the bank,or the credit card place and see about that too?
