How to get my dad's DeviantArt more views?
My dad recently started uploading his photography to DeviantArt. He works really hard at it, and it's actually good. But nobody's taking much notice of it, and it's getting him down. It's also upsetting me because I want to him do well but I am seeing is his disappointment. :'(
Could there be a way to promote his art without being too pushy or spamming people (I don't want to annoy people).

This is my dad's deviantart by the way http://finnanohare.deviantart.com/

Yes your dad is quite good.  Has he tried putting his pics on flickr.com?  They have a much bigger audience and he can join groups over there and add his pics to those groups thus getting more visibility.  Just a thought
Checked out his stuff very cool. 

MyShutterSpace is good. http://www.myshutterspace.com/
http://www.picturesocial.com/ also good.
When it comes to self promotion you really need to get your social networks down pat.
