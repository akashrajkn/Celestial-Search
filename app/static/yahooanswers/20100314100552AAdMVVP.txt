how do you save SNL bumper photos?
when i get on nbc.com and try to save the bumper photos to my computer, it won't let me...is there a way to bypass that? because i'd rather not have to search through google images..thanks!

Take a screen shot of the photo

To take a screen shot of your monitor..press the "Prt Scr" button on your keyboard..its located above the Insert/Delete keys.

Now go to Start...All Programs...Accessories....Windows Paint.

In Windows Paint select the "Edit" Tab and select Paste.

Crop the photo you want and

Select "File" Tab and select "Save As"

Your photo is saved and ready to be posted or e-mailed.

Cheers
