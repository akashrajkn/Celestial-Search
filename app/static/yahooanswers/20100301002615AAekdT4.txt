TUMBLR question! Reblogging / code query?
When someone reblogs my post, nothing happens on my own tumblr to show this. Something does show on other people's tumblrs, though. How can I change this on mine? Sorry if this was a bit confusing :P

Is it a code of some sort?
Thank you VERY much for any help :)
oh wow, you're right! it took like, 24 hours but it shows up. thanks so much!! :D

Maybe your tumblr is running a little bit slow. Try refreshing. If you're a long time tumblr user then you'll know tumblr ALWAYS has problems :)
