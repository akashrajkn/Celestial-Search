You would be far better off using a site like 123 contactform
Its free and very reliable. You can customize it to match your website colours and to add it to your site or web page is a simple copy and paste of the provided code.

Widget box also has contact forms already made for you. just register and add your details.

123contactform is far better than widgetbox in my opinion.
