Copy and Paste from Firefox Randomly Stopped Working?
Since yesterday, I have not been able to copy and paste anything from the internet to Microsoft Word. It just suddenly stopped working, and it is driving me crazy!

Try Paste Special.

In Microsoft Word versions prior to Word 2007:

1.Click the Edit->Paste Special menu item.
2.Select Unformatted Text in the As list box.
3.Click OK.

In Word 2007:

1.Press ALT/CTRL/V.
2.Proceed as in Step 2 above.

Hope that helps.
