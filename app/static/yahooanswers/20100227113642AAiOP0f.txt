I have listened about free GPRS trick?
I have listened about free GPRS trick? I have tried it. But it is not working successfully. Is it requires any types of s/w in mobile and computer? If you have some working tricks of BSNL, AIRTEL, SMART and DOCOMO in working condition then send send me please.
HAPPY HOLI TO YOU ALL.

Buddy... GPRS costs anything from being 'Free to Rs 50' in rental and you are only charged for the data you download, at very cheap rates... Also for all practical purposes, GPRS is a very slow way to access the WAP pages only on dumb phones/pseudo-smart phones. Why are you so bent on trying to cheat the operators and gain access in tricky ways??? Be a man ... pay up for what you use and like ...
Internet on GPRS is something you need to pay for.
If you try to access it for free without paying the internet service provider, you are indulging in a crime.
If they press charges and prosecute you and send you jail. you will have no future left, no passport, no visa, no job prospects for a jail bird.
It certainly is not recommended. Think.
there were many bugs in the systems earlier. now they are fixed. so this type of access is not possible. you can use t-shark if your phone supports it. for a gprs keep your balance lower than the daily fee. sometimes you succeed in this and dont have to pay further for many days. i have done these tricks 2 years back. may be they might not work now. and there is no illegal in it. its the operator's fault. dont try hack tricks. they may track you and put you in jail.
