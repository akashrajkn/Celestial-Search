How can I get them to take this down?
I found out through Googling my name that I am on wink.com and they also have my maiden name posted which bothers me. I emailed them at feedback@wink.com and asked them to remove me but they don't. So how can I get them to take it down? I didn't give them permission to post it! O.o

I know it's what can happen when you're online but I would prefer if they took it down because that's my right. 

TY =)

i don't know but I starred it and maybe some of my contacts do
A letter from your attorney will usually do the trick.

They probably do not read the feedback email.
