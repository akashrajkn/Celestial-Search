Why can't I draw on drawball.com?
On http://one.drawball.com/ I have 100% ink, but can not draw. I have drawn on drawball.com before, but for some reason the website won't let me draw now. What's happening and how do I make it stop?

I just tried it and it's not letting me draw either, maybe it's their server?
