Why aren't payments getting through to me on paypal?
I have been buying on ebay for ages from my ebay account and recently sold some items on there too. The bidders who won sent me the payments but when i check my paypal account none of the payments are in there. I thought i hadn't confirmed my email address but i have now done this and still no payments in the account, though ebay says they have all been received.

HELP!" What's going on? i don't want my customers to get angry!

hey,
it's three separate customers who have paid me, they definitely aren't all lying!!
one of them emailed me asking me to accept and confirm the payment which i tried to do but they still aren't showing in my paypal account...

Tell them to give you the reference number from their payments and to print the screen and fax it to you.  Maybe they are not MAKING the payment and they are lying to you.
I have bought and sold been taking 3-5 days to process
I've been selling on ebay for almost eight years, you may want to check to see if the email address on your posting is correct  AND make sure that paypal has the correct address for you under the profile tab. This will make a difference. Hope everything works out for you.
