What is the best internet browser?
I would like something that is not slow you can get around on like Internet Explorer has.Also can block websites easily.

Opera is the fastest web browser I know, have been using it for ages.
Firefox is nice too, but loads slower.
Google Chrome.
Firefox is the fastest I've ever used, but it really depends on your computer speed, too.
you all need to read her requirements!  with the requirement: block websites

IE can block web sites.
not safari, not opera, not chrome, not firefox.
only IE can do that.
If that were not your requirement, safari and firefox would be my best recommendations as far as ability to render documents.

however, firefox doesn't always print well.  there is an overflow:hidden thing which people are using to display text on IE for printing (why?) and it's causing cross-browser problems.  it's their own fault.
