what does it mean if a guy  insults you by saying your  elbows are too pointy?
Really? A guy I know always tells me I'm unattractive because my elbows are too pointy.

It means he thinks your elbows are too pointy.
it means you guys are probably in middle school
its really not an insult, its more of a joke, maybe hes referring to you as being to skinny.
It means he is a really stupid & rude guy.
hhahahaha. that guy is a weirdo. i'm sorry but nobody normal gives a f**k about elbows on a girl. smile, hair, face, breasts, buttocks....these things matter. elbows? give me a break. what a weird dude.

He could mean something completely different though, just something that I found it could mean.
