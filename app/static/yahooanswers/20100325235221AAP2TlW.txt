Why can't I download my photobucket album?
I'm trying to download my own photobucket album by clicking the "download this album" button. Then i put in the two words (yes im spelling them right) and then i get a red error message:

- There was a problem starting your download

Archive Call Failed -

can someone help me?

There could be alot of variables here.  Need more specifics.  e.g. 

- How many pics in your album?  (PB limit = 2500)
- Do you have any ad/cookie/pop-up blocker, apps, plugins, or browser add-ons?
- Do you have latest Javascript (http://java.com) or Adobe Flash player installs (http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/)?

Feel free to email Photobucket support here:

Thx
