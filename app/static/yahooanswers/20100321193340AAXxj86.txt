When you search a  smiley face :) in google or facebook, why does it say no results?
just wondering lol

no idea. the query doesn't make sense?
I think a better question is why are you searching ':)' in the first place?
because google index words, not strings of symbols.  Google doesn't know it's a face, they look for keywords people are likely to search for.
it doesn't include the colon or the parenthesis in the search, because they are usually not important in serious searches
Most likely because they aren't called Smiley Faces, they are emoticons. So when you search "Facebook Chat Emoticons" you should get several results.

Bonus:  <(") makes a penguin  ;)
You are wasting your points! Since your question makes no sense try these two cool cloud computing websites oos.cc and beta.cloudo.com. Don't spam me! I am just a kid. I just think those two website are very cool! Google them if you don't believe they are safe.
No Search engines detect symbols like that except if you have some customized one
