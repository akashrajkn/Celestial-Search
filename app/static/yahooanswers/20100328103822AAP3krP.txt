Twitter username for Sarah?
My name is Sarah Michelle Garner and I'm 18 yrs old and a senior in high school. I will be an English major next year at college and eventually become a Librarian so obviously I love to read. My favorite color is blue. I don't want anything childish but my real name is already taken on twitter. I just need some ideas as to a good username that isnt taken.

Hi Sarah. Congrats with college and wish you all the luck.
 Librarian, so was thinking of bookworm or bookworm_smg, or bibliophile ( a book collector ), any combination will do, inc blue_bibliophile Please check these out as I don't use twitter.
