Can you respond to someones response to your question on this?"?
When I say this, I mean Yahoo Answers

Well, after the question has been answered, you can add comments to the post, but you have to pull down the "Comments" dropdown and it's not very easy to find, so there is no way to respond in a way that people will easily notice, unless you send them an email.
