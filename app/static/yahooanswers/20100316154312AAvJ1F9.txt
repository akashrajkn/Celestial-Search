Can you get in your GaiaOnline account?
It seems that some people can get into their gaia accounts, but some are completely missing and in peoples friends blocks are just empty where some used to be. My main account I cannot access, while other accounts I can (mules with nothing on them).

This is not my background but it is my profile I am missing, on my boyfriends friendlist I am also missing. http://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd359/Linny_Cat/Picture5.png

I hope there wasn't a major hacking D:< Random people are like this too.

The same thing has happened to me, except I can't access any of my accounts. What is going on?
There was a bug in gaia's system,making people unable to log in,im surprised they got to it that fast
Its been doing the same thing to me also. i was able to access one of my mules. But it showed my original account; Serryy was online yesterday morning when i was not near a computer at all. ive emailed all my friends for help. but i dunno..
