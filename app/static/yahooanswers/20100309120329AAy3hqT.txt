After each movement, Firefox freezes for two seconds.
Everything else works fine in my computer.
Where is the problem?
Is it version 3.6?

Add-ons?

Firefox is still under heavy testing for Windows 7.

You might be able to identify the culprit by searching through the list of reported bugs if you have the time: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?op_sys=Windows%207;query_format=advanced;longdesc=hang%20freeze%20crash;product=Firefox;longdesc_type=anywords
