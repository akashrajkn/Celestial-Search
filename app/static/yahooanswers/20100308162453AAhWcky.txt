How to make money online?
Im trying to find a way to make money online to do in my free time when i get home from school i dont really wanna make my own website, i checked out being an cha cha guide but i need to input my ssn and my parents wont tell me what it is cause its dangerous to put it online i guess can someone recomend some ways to make money online?

Ebay is the easiest, especially if you have a lot of junk that needs a new home.
Selling stuff you don't use, need, wear, etc it's a good start
Alright.. First you nvr want to put your ssn online, especially if its like a website that u dont know / trust. Im 15 and i make some good money online. If you can get lots of referrals, you can make lots of money. I make a steady $20 a month, but i bet that if i tried, i could get so much more.. Here are the websites, check them out:

These websites are legit. I hav gone through lots of websites that are scams but these r for real.

What is your first sense when you meet some program that promise you to give money just for joining with no other efforts? "It is too good to be true" - is that? In prevalence it IS too good to be true.
The Internet is overload with all kinds of on-line business stuff. There are many usable programs either. But as far as I know by experience there aren't way to earn money without investing your efforts. Firstly you must learn a lot to succeed in that field. Secondly you must implement what you learn. Without these main things every program that you join will seem scam.
Smart Bargain Hunters is a good website for making money online. If you are patient and use a good bidding strategy you can usually win items that cost around $300 while only spending $30. Then just sell back the items on Ebay for around retail price.
Step 1: Open a paypal account.
Step 2: Use a credit card to verify your paypal account.(optional)
Step 3: Join the world of Paid Surveys, Paid to Click and Paid to Read. These websites are free to register and within a month you start earning. Slowly but steadily your money grows and you get a payout. Sooner than you think you get another payout and this continues as long as you click. 
Step 4: When you reach a minimum payout you may encash to your paypal account or rent referrals (who earn for you) and encash later when you have a good balance.
Step 5: Eventually you transfer the amount to paypal and then to your bank account. You can also use the paypal earnings for online shopping.
There are a lot of scams over the net so I am giving a few websites that ACTUALLY PAY. I use them  and they really work.
