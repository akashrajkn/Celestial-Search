how do you show history on firefox when the history has been hidden?
i can't figure out how to show the history. my brother hide my history on my computer and now i can't figure out how to show it. or to see past history. someone PLEASE HELP :)

you answered my question i will try to help you out. if you search the tool bar on start up when the internet is runing search for browsing history it will give you everywhere it has been gone and seen that is if browsing history has not been deleted.(good luck)
