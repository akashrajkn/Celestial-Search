is twitter better than facebook ?
FOLLOW ME @alexu_mzsmoore :):)

surely its not coz its just like the status bit of facebook??
Not near as good!
Yes
It depends. If you're into lurking celebrities and checking/following people's status updates, Twitter is better. If you're into applications, then Facebook is better.

Personally, I prefer Facebook since you can also check your friends' updates at the same time you can also enjoy its applications and upload a lot of pictures.
