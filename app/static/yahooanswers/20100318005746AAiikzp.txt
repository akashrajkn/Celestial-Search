Skype help! It thinks im already signed in!?
Skype wont let me log in, as it says that im already logged on, on that computer. how can i fix this?
Thanks!

only thing i can think of is have you tried the task manager? maybe you have skype open twice

or if there is more than one user account on your computer? is it possible you are signed in on the other user account?
Restart your computer
