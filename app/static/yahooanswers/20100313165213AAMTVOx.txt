Why isn't the dulce cosmetics site working?
I just saw the makeup on juicystars07's youtube and I want it sooo bad! I get to where it says proceed with payment and I click it and it says "secure connection failed" or something. Help? 


I have firefox.
this is exactly what it is.

Secure Connection Failed

The "or something" makes your question hard to answer.  You need to be specific when asking a question in order to get an accurate answer
The site is under maintenance.
The site probably wasn't equipped to handle all of the traffic.
I want to buy stuff from there too!
Love Juicystar07!
Just be patient, hopefully it'll be up soon!
