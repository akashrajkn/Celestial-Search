call them and tell them your details and ask if they recived your info
Ive just had a look and it seems its a scam, you might not lose anything as such but they now have your details and with your social security number could possibly steal your identity although this company seems to be taking details for marketing purposes to be able to send you junk mail etc...I wouldnt rule out fraud though so keep your eyes peeled and report it to the local authorities too.
