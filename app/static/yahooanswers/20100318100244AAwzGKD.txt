reselling items on ebay that I purchased on ebay?
I purchased an item off of ebay and while it is accurate, it is too big.  How do I use the pictue from the seller's original listing?  I still see it in 'My Won' listing but can't seem to copy the picture.
Does the seller own the rights to the picture and I have to take a new one?  I have a couple items that I want to resell and it would simply be easier to use the same pictures.

First, I would ask the original seller if it's okay.

Then, either ask them to send you the files, or right-click on the pictures on the site and save them to your local drive. Then re-upload them to the seller page when you create it.

If you can't do this, time to get the camera out.
technically they do have rights to the picture, but i dont think most people really care. you cant right click and copy it but one way to copy it is to open the picture then click "print screen" on your keyboard. Open up paint now and just paste it and cut the picture out and save it and now u have the picture.
Its a big no no to pinch the sellers photo (and/or description), and if reported your auction will be taken down almost immediately, and you will get a slap and restrictions on your account.
Either don't be so lazy and take your own photo, or ask the Seller for his permission
