Why does my laptop read "connected to wireless network" but cannot access the internet?
My laptop connects to my wireless router without a problem.  It even reads connected to the name of my network and states that the connection strength is excellent but when I try to access the internet I can't. Once the internet explorer starts up is shows the general cannot access website page.  Can anybody tell me what the problem could possibly be? Thanks in advance.

Try turning off DHCP in your OS, using a static IP and entering your nameserver addresses manually.
