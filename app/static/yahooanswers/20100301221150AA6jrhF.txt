how do I get my web pages bigger on my browser. (They are tiny and I can't read them)?

As the administrator on my netbook I notice that the letters are wrong. But on the other user the letters are right.

Generally you drag the bottom left corning of the screen to the desired size.

PC, Mac?

On a Mac you can hold down "shift" and move 2 fingers up the trackpad to zoom in. and drag 2 fingers down to un-zoom. maybe you can do that in pc too.. i dunno
Two possibilities (1) if there is a magnifying glass with the letters 100 % in the lower right corner, you can click on that to enlarge the page (2) your computer may have a built in magnifier - it can be found after clicking on the control panel
Hit 'CTRL' + '+'
Hold CTRL and use the middle scroll button on your mouse.
Or Hold CTRL and use + - buttons on your keyboard.

Hold CTRL and press 0 to set it back to default.
Hey..

Press and hold 'ctrl' key on your keyboard and scroll up/down mouse to resize the browser window.

Let me know if this helps abhysunny@gmail.com
