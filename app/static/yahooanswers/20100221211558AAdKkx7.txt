And good usernames for Twitter?
I need to figure out a twitter username, but the ones I chose are already taken. Here is a little about me: 
 My nicknames are allykat or beetle.
i'm just a teenager in high school
I talk a lot
I live in a small town down south.
I am a country girl and i love to go muddin (but I'm not a hillbilly!)
and I'm single and PROUD OF IT!!! (but I won't always be so maybe that's not a good idea)
And I don't know what else to put because I hate putting stuff about celebrities.

Thanks a lot everyone!!
