www.grooveshark.com...................?
I always listen to music on the above site but for some reason today it will not work.

It loads the page fully and then gives me this message

"This is not a recognized host. To use Grooveshark, go to http://www.grooveshark.com."

I try again to no avail. Please help me.
Well i doubt hacking into someone grooveshark would be of any use to anyone. I also just installed the latest flash player.

I use it all the time...
mabye you type the wrong password 
or got hacked

or didn't install the flash player thingie
o your computer needs fixing
or ur internet is down
or your internet is slow
