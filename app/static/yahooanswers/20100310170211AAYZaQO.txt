Is there a way to go to desktop from full screen view of firefox?
Like an addon by which by clicking twice or thrice any key we would go to desktop as there is no minimize key in fullscreen

no
Just move your cursor up to the top of the screen in full screen mode and the minimize button appears
Yes, there is.  Press and hold "Alt+tab".  Continue to press tab until "Desktop" is selected.
If you're on windows hold the windows key and hit M. This will minimize all windows and show the desktop.
