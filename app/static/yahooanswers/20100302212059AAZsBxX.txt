Aim people "logged off under a minute ago"?
As soon as i go on aim it always lists a handful of my buddies as "logging off under a minute ago" but i know people arent logging off simultaneously as soon as i get on (if they did they would have just blocked me). any idea what causes it or how to get it to stop, i would like to get an accurate gauge on when people get off aim if thats possible

Its just how AIM works. You have to stay online 24/7 to get real time data
