Internet Explorer/Firefox " not responding".. why ?
It happened lately when I go to websites to view videos or listen to music (youtube for example)
I have mcaphee installed..
I just bought this HP dv4-2040 US and it's so annoying...

I hate when that happens....
make sure you have all current versions of directX and flash installed.  sites like that have alot of advertisements that can bog down your comp if you dont.
