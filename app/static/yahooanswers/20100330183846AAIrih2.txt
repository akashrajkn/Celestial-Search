Internet out in the country?
i live out in the country and i have dial-up and it sucks. do any of you know any cheap ways of getting high speed internet out here? Like satalite that does not cost like $60 a month.

Plug your zip code into an internet search and add high speed internet service provider to your query (I.E. "12345 high speed internet service provider). Most carriers won't service rural areas because of the expense in laying high speed lines.
