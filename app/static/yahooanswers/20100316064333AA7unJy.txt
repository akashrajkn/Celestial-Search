When signing up for stuff or uploading pictures, why is there a code?
I was trying to upload a picture for my Y! A avatar and it has a code like; errZ5 or JbnHl56. Why does Yahoo (and other websites) have those?

these are not codes!!!
these are captcha!!!!
and the reason that there are there is to avoid bots( automatically machines that try to get access )
Keeps spam bots away.
It's the best way to tell that you are human.
The codes can be typed in the required box by human beings. Any automated software cannot do this anonymously.
