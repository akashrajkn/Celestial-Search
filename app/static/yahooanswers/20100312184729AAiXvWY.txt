INTERNET ROUTER question?
alright, I have a laptop and soon my little sister is getting a netbook. I have a wireless router, but i was thinking if the router can give access to both my laptop and netbook without getting another Enternet cable or router??

If you are using wireless on both your laptop and your netbook, then you don't need any extra cables or routers.  Multiple devices can connect to a wireless router at once.
Yes.
Yes
it should most can handle two or more machines. although with both on at once, you may notice a tad slower speed.
Yes. Most routers will support up to 256 devices. Normally this is 4 hardwired and the rest would be wireless unless a switch is added to the router. 

In you case, you would only need a cable if you wanted to plug the netbook directly into a port on the router instead of using a wireless connection.
yes it can not a problem 90% of wireless routers theese days have upt2  4 connections on them 95% have atleast 2...
If you have some more information about the model of router (and how you've got it connected currently) somebody might be able to check for certain.

Routers generally are not single device err, devices. They're designed to connect multiple machines to the internet at the same time.

So just hook her netbook up with wireless and away you go!
