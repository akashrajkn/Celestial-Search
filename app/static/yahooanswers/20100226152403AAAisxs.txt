Help - Moderator on Discussion Forum Blocking My Computer?
I had an account with a discussion forum. I opened a second account for separate issues in the forum. Both my accounts are now banned by the moderator for having more than one account. How did they know I opened a second account - I opened it with a separate email address and screen name? I want to get a new account but the sign in page is automatically locked. Is there something I can change in my computer or internet settings to open another account?

Same IP address. There's nothing you can do. Try actually following the rules of the forum for once, 'kay?
