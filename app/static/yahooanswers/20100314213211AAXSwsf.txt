How to enable disabled toolbars in firefox?
I am new to firefox and was wandering how do I enable a previously disabled toolbar?

VIEW > TOOLBARS >> Then select the toolbar u want, and de-select the ones u dont...
Click View, Toolbars, and click the Toolbar you are trying to enable.
go to tools then add ons nd evry thing is there ?
