where can i find pictures of william henry furman?
i have to create a website for school about this case and it would be nice if i could put pictures up on the web. but i can't find any. it says that he was a black man and everytime i type in his name, a white man pops up. so please help me. thanks

photoshop him black. Or he could really just be white and the source you got the info. from purposely said he was black.
