Can you figure out who is asking anonymous questions on formspring.me?


Supposedly they are revealing all the anonymous user questions on April Fools Day.
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain code to figure out yourself though, the website seems pretty amateur.
No.
You can kinda have a rough estimate of who asked you by the way they type online, but this won't always be accurate though.
I don't think so. I wish they did though, right? Because people ask me questions like Jessi, I love youu. And they wont say who they are, but it should say their email at least to ask a question so you have an idea of who is asking you inappropriate questions. And people need to realize that formsping is'nt a website were you can talk shiz about that person and make them feel bad, and they don't know who is saying that about them, it's the worst feeling ever. Some one called me ugly on it and i cryed for 2 days straight, and realizing that anyone in my school could of said it; even by best friend. Be sure not to say bad stuff about anyone on formspring, because you dont want to be a bully. and if on april ools day; i they do reveal who said it and your name pops up, you could loose your friends forever. so becareful on there. Bye. Sincerly, Jessi
