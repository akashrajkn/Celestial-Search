How do I watch videos on Megavideo without the time limit?
I have tried -
Downloading it with download helper in firefox
downloading it and watching it offline
downloading hotspot and hiding my ip address

I can't figure it out i don't want to buy a subscription, it is a ripoff and i heard you still have a time limit.

You have to buy the membership deal, there's no way around it.  You can be a member, but a member without the subscription deal is just like a guest watching a small portion of the video then having it stop on them.
You don't want to pay for a subscription, and you don't have a problem with stealing? Some piece of work you are!
go to this website

follow the steps that are shown and then you can watch videos without the limit
you can even watch watch videos after the time limit ( i do it ).
You just have to watch it from the begining and it takes time to buffer and not much
Believe me.. There is ways around it. 

Every time my Megavideo time runs out all I do is:

!) Reach over to my Router. 
2) Press the button to turn it off. (or just unplug the power cord)
4)Turn it back on (or plug back in)
5) Megavideo time is reset. 

Thats all.
