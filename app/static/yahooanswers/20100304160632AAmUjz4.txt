Is my router why my internet refuses to work? or is Time Warner Cable a bad wireless provider?
I play online games, and I was trying to log in, but every time I try I get stuck at the loading screen with a "Not Responding" message and get "Disconnected from the world server"

Now, before I had this problem and I thought it was because I was too far away from my wireless router, things worked for a few days on my laptop but now its horrible.

It took me 45 minutes or so to log in yesterday, and it's almost been an hour today. Im using some sort of DLink router, do i need to get a better one? or is Time warner cable bad for wireless

Now, the family desktop runs my game just fine and it's a few years older than my laptop. (that was extra info incase that helps)

problem can be in your lap top's lan card or wireless card...if every thing is alright with deskto computer than the dlink is working fine...
well if your playing games you should always be on LAN(Hooked to your router with a cable instead of wireless) because no matter what ISP(Internet service Provider) you have, an LAN connection increases speed.  I have Time Warner Internet and my computer is ok on wireless.  I think the problem is your router.  OR maybe you live in a bad area.(Like you get a bad connection to Time Warner)I would try replacing the router first.
