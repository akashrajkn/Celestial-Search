Is it possible to search by a photo?
Is there any way i can upload a picture to somthing and the web will search for the same picture?
Thanks

If you get a picture up on the web and you select Images at the top in Google, you can select to find similar pictures. It might find what you are looking for.
Searches Images with right click.
