Paypal combine two gift disposable credit card ?
Can i combine two gift / disposable credit cards plus my paypal balance
to buy something 
for an example 1 $100 gift credit card and 1 $50 gift credit card plus 50$ in my paypal
to buy a 200 dollar item on ebay
thank you sooo much
but can i combine them
like all three into one payment

Only if the gift cards are from Visa, Master Card, Discover or Amex! It's still going to be difficult to split payments across several cards like that!
