If you could only get on one website for the rest of your life what website would it be?


Off the internet!
My own - of course :-)
Craigslist, because it offers so very  much...I like to sell, buy, barter stuff in my community , so CL is perfect for myself...
Quite simply, a website that is a proxy server so that I can view any other page on the Internet.

Failing that, I'd stick to http://archive.org/ which may not have current information, but would allow me to research what used to be on most websites, so from a historical standpoint, this would be more interesting.
