Any Good Ideas For An IMVU Avatar Name?
My current name is XxDisentrancedxX, and I've had this acount since September of 08' and have never changed my name since. But I'm wanting to. I just can't think of anything great. I want something that sounds cool, and is me. So far I've been able to come up with "Thallium", "Philophobia" and "Autophobia". But some things that happed to me today changed my mind. So I was thinking something with one of these 3 words, "Shattered", "Twisted" or "Tragic".. Any ideas? I'd appreciate the help ^-^

First sighn out of your current account and say "Join Imvu'To make sure the name isn't already taken. Here are my ideas
