Best browser for Windows Vista SP2?
Only based on safety, speed, and stability.

I don't care about customization or the appearance.

I always say firefox first, google chrome second
Any one would do you can have as many browsers as you want installed on your computer I have both IE8 and firefox.
There is quite a range of browsers that would suit your needs. I personally use Chrome first and Firefox second though Opera, and Safari are both fine. And i believe IE8 is safe too. 

Chrome:
http://www.google.com/chrome
Firefox:
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html
Opera:
http://www.opera.com/
Safari:
http://www.apple.com/safari/
Use Mozilla Firefox Version 3.6, it¡¯s the best.
Try the newly released opera 10.5! It rocks! its the fastest!
http://www.opera.com/

DONT USE CHROME.its all hype :(
