How in the world do I join restricted Roleplays on Second Life?
I'm old enough to join these. I promise to obey their rules....but every time I try to teleport there, it says I'm not allowed.

The two roleplays I'm talking about are Nomos and Malka City. 

So...how can I join these if I'm not allowed to teleport there? Lots of other people play....what's the secret? Please, give me suggestions on how to join, begging you....

We are currently setting up a new game at Nomos, so it is closed to the public.
That is why you cannot teleport here at the moment.

You are welcome to check out our website http://www.socionex.com to find out more about it.
We hope to be able to open the SIM sometime next week.

If you are in the Nomos group, you will get a notice when the SIM is open ... or try to teleport next week... 

Good luck :)
