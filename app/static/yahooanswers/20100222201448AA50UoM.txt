How do you get your own email address?
is there a FREE way of getting your own email domain name without having to sign up for website hosts? For example:  testemail@mtz.com   =   and if you know a great/awesome provider that you still have to sign up for a web host please tell me. Thanks

not unless you buy a domain name....
You have to buy your own domain name no matter what. You can actually have google host it and it works just like GMail. For free, even.

You have a few options, but non are free.

1) There are registrars (companies that you buy domains from) that will let you buy a domain and e-mail hosting for next to nothing. 

2) Buy a domain with e-mail forwarding, and have all e-mails forward to an existing e-mail account. This means when you reply, your testemail@mtz.com won't show as the from e-mail address.

3) Buy a domain and use free web hosting. There are a few good ones around.

4) Get a subdomain e-mail address, like youname@anothername.zzn.com. I'm sure there are a few like this around. Try http://www.zzn.com
