I have firefox, and for some reason I am struggling to copy and paste with my right click. What is wrong?


You Probably have the YAHOO! toolbar installed, that causes the problem. Un-install it, and everything should be fine again.
Common problem give up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer without opening any windows something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible
Try it in another browser.  If it is only doing it in Firefox, try Firefox on another user account.
Do you mean your right click does not work any more ? 
If it is so,  you have to uninstall yahoo toolbar  that is installed on your firefox (Sometimes Yahoo toolbar makes this problem).

Tools > Options > Main (tab) > Manage Add-Ons... (button) > Clicked on Yahoo Toolbar > Uninstall (button)

Restart your computer.

Good Luck
