Is there an Internet site that?
will let you watch movies online that are at the Theaters if you are willing to pay?Must be Legitimate and under no false pretenses if I pay I want to watch the freaking movie I am looking for and not just end up paying to download some crappy media player or some spam junk site!!!

If you're looking for something legitimate, no. You can't have something legitimate and illegal at the same time. ;)

However, if you don't mind, registration, viruses, spam, identity theft, and not being able to see the movie in the end, there's plenty. ;)
no. movies at the theater are only available at the theater, period. even after it's released on DVD, your options are limited. netflix is your best bet but for streaming it is mainly older and B titles.
You can watch it at http://watchmovies.onlineforfree.net

Hope that helps!
