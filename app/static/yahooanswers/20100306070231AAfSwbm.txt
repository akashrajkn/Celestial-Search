If you're under 18, some sites don't let you view certain things.
It mabye because your under 18 or they may of banned you from the use of SwagBucks special offers page.

You actually need to go through, and skip all of the offers to get the 2SB's
they changed it :(

Swagbucks has discovered that some users bookmarked the page where you get your Swagbucks. So, Swagbucks changed the code so that you will have to go through the Special Offers.
