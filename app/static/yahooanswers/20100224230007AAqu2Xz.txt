I want to create a blog, but need some help creating a catchy name?
I want to create a blog all about my travels, moving to London from New Zealand, and travelling around Europe.
I want to talk about the transition from a tiny city in little New Zealand to one of the largest cities in the world.
I have all the ideas but just need a catchy name for my blog.
Any ideas around this theme would be awesome... I'll be sure to thank you in my blog once up and running.

THANKS
