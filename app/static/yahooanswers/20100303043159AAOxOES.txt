Have ebay refunded michael jackson ticket buyers?
I would like to know what happened to ebay refunding buyers of michael jackson tickets. I m a little suprised that there are not lots and lots of topics on the net about this, or has everybody else been refunded now?

So did Ebay ever refund buyers of MJ tickets?

eBay does not have to refund the buyers. The Sellers do.

eBay was the listings host they do not have to refund the buyer as ebay did not recieve the buyers payment. HOWEVER.
eBay did extend the buyer protection to anyone that bought tickets so that they could be refunded. And ebay refunded some buyers so that they themselves could claim the money from the seller.
eBay has more power to get the money from a seller than a buyer does as they can afford to do all the legal stuff.
