What is your position on net neutrality? What do you think the government should do?


the government will do what it wants to do
I don't even understand the term net neutrality.  I don't see how the net is biased.  If the government starts giving us internet for free (after nice pretty taxes of course) or better internet infrastructure, then they'll just control how much they want to charge us in taxes.  Obviously, that's if they don't bankrupt us first.
I think so, I had to switch ISP because they throttled my entire connection down just because I was torrenting Ubuntu 9.04 and Openoffice.

With the "high speed intenter" I was getting, DAIL-UP internet would be faster even with the vuze off.
