which domain name is good? mypcfix.org or fixpc.us?
hi i am goona buy new doamin so please suggest me which name is good for domain
1. mypcfix.org
2. fixpc.us

I don't really like either, but I prefer fixpc as a start, it seems more professional than mypcfix. That kinda sounds like a scam website.
for a compnay? use a .biz domain.
like fixmypc.biz
or stick with the .org.
.us is usually for government sites.
If your business is located in US I prefer fixpc.us.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Hai..I here..I suggest this mypcfix.org is best for your site...It says that it's about an organization...Then if you use .US means peoples from other country thought that it's for US user mostly..So you can use mypcfix.org..In here http://www.XnYnZ.com/ you can register the Domain Name at low cost.
