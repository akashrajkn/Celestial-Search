what's the best internet site for downloading torrent file?
i'm looking for  hard to find songs....

Your best to purchase the song from their rightful owners. because in a few years when these websites get sued for copyright infringement the record labels will have full access to all the people that downloaded the illegal material. do you want to get sued for $3600 a song? think about it.
Downloading music in mosts cases will be illegal (some music is free)

I use 

http://torrentz.com  to search for various things (it's a search engine)
http://demonoid.com for more specialized searches (it's a private tracker, so there's usually harder to find things there)

check your emails, I sent you an invite to Demonoid
http://www.mininova.org/
http://thepiratebay.org/
http://isohunt.com/

Some music is just going to be hard to find on torrents. Chances are that if the main popular torrent websites do not have them (piratebay, mininova, isohunt), you won't be able to find them anywhere for free, including limewire.

To answer your original question, the best place to get torrents (assuming they are legal...ehem ehem) are private tracker websites like bitGAMER and demonoid. They are the best because they have rules where you have to keep your upload ratio similar to your download ratio. Basically this makes it so that people don't just hog the torrents, and people will actually upload them to you like the whole torrent system is supposed to work.

Getting music is harder to find on private tracker websites because they are less populated than sites like the ones I listed above. To find those songs will be difficult if you do not see them on piratebay or mininova. That means you might actually have to pay for them. ARGHHHHH!

Download what you want. but don't forget to upload! Sharing is the way that we can keep torrent websites alive!
