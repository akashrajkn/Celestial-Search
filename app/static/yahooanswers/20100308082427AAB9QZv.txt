What happened to ICEFILMS?
Possibly the best website ever has disapeared!!

I've heard from a friend that they ran into problems with godaddy as their server and are currently looking for another one to replace it. Don't know if this 100% true though
According to their mods the admin are aware of the problem - read this: http://forum.icefilms.info/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=9182 that should tell you that there is problems and no ETA on the sites return.

 Oh yeah and "Icefilms hasn't used godaddy for a bit, and this is not a problem with them" that's from the post of a mod on their forums.
