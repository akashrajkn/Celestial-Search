On Zwinky, I have too many saved outfits. How do I delete multiple at one time?
I have the maximum number of saved outfits, and most of them are stupid outfits that I will never use. Is there a way that I could delete multiple at one time?

Sorry kiddo you cant xD

you can't delete more than one at a time, but the max number is 15 in standard anyway, which shouldnt take too long. what you could also do is get a wardrobe transfer with a tan, these come with WAY more than the 15 u are allowed. ill post some links for youtube for tan ,, one for male and female, for whichever you prefer. you have to watch the video closely to know wwht to do, this way you can't get hacked either, becasue you arent handing out your password! :) hope you like this.
