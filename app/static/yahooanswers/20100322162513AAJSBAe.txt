I have been watching Dexter on Mega-video how do you beat that 72 minute crap?
I have just been waiting the 54 minutes then I start it all over, but I like it,  so maybe it is a good thing. but it takes up to much time. please help I have explorer 7

Well aside from paying 200 dollars for  a premium membership you could try refreshing the page, more often then not it'll get rid of the 54 minute waiting time or at least cut it down considerably.
I can understand but here you loose all episodes high quality.
I hope you will enjoy here, I myself am addicted to Dexter
