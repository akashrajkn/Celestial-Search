Where can I find stock photos to include in articles?
I take part in article writing sometimes on the internet.   Very few of my articles contain pictures and I'd like to change that.   Is there a place on the internet that has lots and lots of photos I can choose from to send to my desktop that I then can use to include in articles I write on the internet.  I'd also like usage of the stock photo site to be free and easy to use.

I usually use Stock Exchange, free depending on the image required.
You can find good photos for writing articles and blogs in this website : http://www.istockphoto.com
They are very cheap photos that sell for as little as $1.00. 
Be careful and avoid infringing on people's patent rights when using images that you have not created or bought.
My favorite stock photo website is http://www.photo-wizard.net 

Here is where you can find some other inexpensive stock photo directories:
