is there a way to get free internet connection?


Yes netzero gives free dail up connection to anybody. The limit per month of usage is 10 hours.
yes there is! actually I'm using it right now, all you have to do is tunnel the connection. for more details contact me.
Yeah if you have a wifi enabled computer you can rob other peoples internet but i don't recommend it just because i don't believe in it but i do believe it is legal to do. :)
well netzero gives you free dial up but thats really slow and only ten hours a month otherwise go to mcdonalds or starbucks theres free wifi there
Yes, go to the library or go to your nearest unemployment office and get on their computers other than that nothing is free.
You can access the internet on a variety of different devices. You will have to pay though. Library is probably the best option. Otherwise, no.

Some phone contracts allow you to have free internet access on your mobile phone.
A)Use dial-up.
B)Go to a place like Starbucks or McDonald's and use their free Wi-Fi.
C)Use your neighbors unsecured Wi-Fi network (not legal, though).
