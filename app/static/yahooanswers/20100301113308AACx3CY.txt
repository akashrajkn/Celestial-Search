Creative&Cute title for my fashion blog?
I live in Hungary and my name is Regina. I want my blog title ( ...../blogspot.com) to be really creative and cute. I like this blog's title : www.theblondesalad.com
As i was thinking about a name i realized that my blog is going to be a mix/salad about my life, because it is going to be about fashion, beauty, my life, and everything else i like. I would love to have the "salad" word in my blog title. 

Thanks for helping me :)

My first thought was "Regina's Rack" but I'd suspect that wouldn't get you the user base you're looking for.
