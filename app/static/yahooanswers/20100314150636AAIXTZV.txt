Okay so theres ONE site that wont work?
Okay so i was on this site, then I exited it out by accident, so I opened another page and type it in again but it wouldn't come up. Everything works BUT this site.! And like, I was JUST on it... it just keeps saying "Server not found". GAH HELP!
How do I "Clean my cookies and brousers" or whatever?
