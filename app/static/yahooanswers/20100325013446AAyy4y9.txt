Browsing cookie causing a site to not update?
I'm sure that Youtube just got its new looking recently. But when I checked the site using Chrome, Youtube showed the previous looking with five stars rating still up there. Then I cleaned my browsing data and then the new looking was there. So I reckon the reason is that Chrome pretty much downloaded the design of the whole site so that even though the site itself is updated it wont be shown.

Can anybody tells me if I'm right? And if so, how to turn off this kind of function without affecting any other cookie?(You know I do like cookies since they make website load way faster)
