Formspring.me question...?
Ok, so I made asked a few questions to people on formspring.me. And now I want to make an account. But when I make an account. Will the person who I asked the questions KNOW I sent them it? So it will no longer be anon but show my profile next to question

nope, It can't track anon questions, it won't even know it was the same person who asked those questions...
When you get an account you can still choose to put your account name or use anon.
