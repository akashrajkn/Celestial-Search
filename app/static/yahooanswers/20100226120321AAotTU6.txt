Will Watching videos online use up my limited internet?
i have 1gig of (3) 3g internet a month, Will youtube and webcaming use it up?

Most definitely.

I use Verizon tethering and in 1 months time I had 3 Gig used up doing basic youtube, myspace, etc type things.  You could go through 3 Gig each month easily.
Well 1G is alot of data but yes, anything will use it up. Even if your online and not using Programs like Internet explorer, other programs are using the internet in the background.
Everything you do online will consume bandwidth, so if you check your e-mails, browse the internet, stream music or video, everything will consume a part of your 1GB monthly limit. Streaming music and video consumes more bandwidth than simply browsing the internet, so if you watch videos on YouTube often you will reach your limit faster than if you would not use YouTube at all for example.
