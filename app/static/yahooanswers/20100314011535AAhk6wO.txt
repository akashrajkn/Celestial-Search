Why aren't tweets appearing on my timeline anymore?
I was talking to some friends via twitter.. then i refreshed the page and all their tweets were gone. It only shows mine, The most recent tweet from someone else is 4 days ago it shows.. If i go to my friends page, it shows they are tweeting,but it just isnt showing up on my timeline, what do i do?? 10 points!

it will probably work after a bit..i know that one of my other friends was having problems with her's too. ill give you the link to her twitter to ask her...otherwise maybe you can just wait till twitter gets it fixed =]

here's her twitter: http://twitter.com/JazziieLOVE

good luck!
