Can I order anything off the internet from anywhere?
(I live in Canada)

I'm browsing online for prom dresses
and I'm going through, which I think to believe are,
American promgirl sites .. Does it matter if I live in Canada
or not ? Is it always possible to buy anything online?
There are these prom dresses that are super nice ..
I just don't want to get too excited if I'm not able to
purchase them!

Please help! I can't wait to order my prom dress soon!

eBay
Certain places may or may not ship internationally. *USUALLY* US places will ship to Canada (which I like to call North United States ;-) ), but you should contact them to find out just in case.
i think you can order anything from internet, where ever you are. you should try amazon.com for online shop.
