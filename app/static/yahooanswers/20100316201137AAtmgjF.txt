What do chain letter writers get?
Just wondering what those people who write chain letters that threaten you get out of it?  Like the ones that say "send this to 10 people or something bad will happen."  Is it just pure immaturity or do they get something out of it?

Sore fingers
Psychotherapy! They're prolly crazy and that crap is dumb!
Satisfaction in the knowledge that they have annoyed the crap out of people.
most of the time just their info stolen or a lot of spam..those chain letters keep accumulating, e-mail addresses and Spam bots love that..
what those letters say is never true..NEVER

hope this helps
