Is this a legit site. Big savings?
I am looking at a few items that are priced less the most places. They are of BBB. here is the linkhttp://appliances-2home.com/index.php?os¡­

resellerratings has no entries for appliances-2home.com I would be immediately suspect. Also, the website uses the name of another big retailer (US Appliance) and looks like it has absolutely no affiliation. I wouldn't buy anything from them.
