Stop Twitter Updates from Obama?
I have a T-Mobile phone and every time I go to a bigger city I get Twitter updates from Obama. I do not have a Twitter account, and I do not want to receive these updates. Is there any way to stop them from being sent to me? Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks.
Duh. 
I'm not stupid, that has already occured to me. However, I live in a smal town which does not have much in the way of shopping and such, so I frequently visit the larger cities in order to obtain some neccesities that are not available to me at home. Now, this is not that big of a deal to me, although sometimes it ets annoying because it sends the same message over and over again. So, if there is a way to stop them, I would like to know. If not, I'll live.

Yes just stop going to big cities.
If you don't have a twitter account something is going wrong or someone has registered with your phone number. To stop the updates simply send this text message 'OFF <TwitterUserName>' to 40404. In your case that would be 'OFF OBAMA'.
