i dont think you can send and money order or cash..you could get a prepaid debit card though
You can ask the sellers of the items you want on ebay if they will take a money order.  I'll take one at my store here on ioffer.com

You can purchase a pre-paid credit card.
First of all NEVER SEND CASH IN MAIL...now days Ebay only accepting paypal which required to have bank account and of course debit or credit cards...and using money order is really a bad thing...my best advice get bank account sign up for paypal its safe and you can use it all most every sites. Good luck
I used to buy online, but I became suspicious about online security quickly.  Now I only use the 1 (800) numbers of online retailers to speak directly to staff and management for purchases.  It's a whole lot safer.  Try it.
no you need an atm debit card or credit card
you need to get a checking account
to get a debit card
You either need a pay pal account or a pre paid debit card,that way you can shop on line.
