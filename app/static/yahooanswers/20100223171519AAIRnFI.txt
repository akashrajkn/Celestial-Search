Swagbucks.com tips for maximizing Swagbucks?
Does anybody know any ways to LEGALLY maximize swagbucks on Swagbucks.com? I'm not on facebook or twitter or anything like that,and i don't have anybody to refer,but i'm thinking about starting a blog,would this help?

the only thing I can say is to be active on the site, try to get referals. If you want to make an online search use it instead of google and aim for a buck a day, they'll start adding up.
The truth of it all is your going to have to bug people on some sort of site,just try to be polite about it.Try something like this,cut and paste it if you like.Want to try out swagbucks for free prizes earned by surfing the net? http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/GeoswGr
