Is this website a con?
This website, and lots like it that I've seen, say that it will give me free stuff for doing offers and marketing stuff. I'm willing to do that because all in all it saves money but I'm not sure I wanna do it unless I'm sure it's legit. Does anyone know?
Here's the site: http://apple.freebiejeebies.co.uk/209084

Its a trap
It's a total scam!
yep! it is most def a con
Not a scam but still don't expect anything for nothing!
It's actually not a scam. They get paid through the adds that you complete with your offer and the ones that your referrals do.

I just personally got my 4th referral (Went to my friends house and helped him through it), so I'm about to have a prize shipper to me. The intuit offer on the site is free if you do it right, if not the little bid tasty one is good to ($15 cost about, but a chance to win prizes based on your skill to determine what other people will do whilst bidding).

All in all, yes they will payout and you can earn stuff for free, but it will take a little bit of work to show people how to get the offers done and get them to do it.
