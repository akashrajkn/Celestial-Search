were can you buy backstage concert passes online or elsewhere?
ok i"m going to a Rehab and uncle kracker concert soon and i was wondering were you can buy backstage passes online or were else you can get them??

usually you have to be tight with the band, their management, or the promoter. that or a hot chick. chances are slim and none to buying them. they are given to roadies, venue people, etc.
You cannot buy backstage tickets or passes but you can get them for free.  I used to do it all the time when I was younger. Just check out http://www.igotbackstagepasses.com  for details.
