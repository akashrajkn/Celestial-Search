Downloading vs streaming?
Generally speaking which would cause you to use more of your download limit on your internet plan.

Downloading a torrent versus streaming a video (assuming it is the same video file).

I would think streaming since the torrent is compressed.
THAT DEPENDS ON THE VS VS VS BUT ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER NO AND YES BUT TO THE CONTRARY IN REVERSE BUT THAT'S UP TO YOU AND THE ONES YOU LEFT BEHIND AFTER ALL THAT'S YOU ON THE CORNER THAT'S YOU ON THE SPOTLIGHT LOOSING YOUR RELIGION!     AND REMEMBER ALWAYS USE CA ANTIVIRUS AND NEVER EVER BUY FROM E-BAY!
Realistically, they are the same thing... but depending on the "download" version, what type of file it is makes a difference. Differing downloadable files are compressed to be differing sizes. 

As for SWF and other Java type video files (streamed), they are compressed as well. chances are that the SWF and Java files are smaller. However, the quality lacks too.

Factors you need to know....Size of the "screen." If it is 640x720... or smaller than that... will make less of a dent in any "capped" internet account limits. If the screen size is 1230x720... that will make a more sizeable chunk in the cap limit. 

You will also need to know the lowest bit rate (general quality), to make the right choices of limiting your download. Super good quality will take your limit almost immediately.

With what little info you give, i would suggest watching it on the PC, directly (streaming), versus downloading.  AVI's and mpegs tend to be larger than Flah/java/SWF/JPEG video files.

Streaming also makes sure you do not get into trouble with the Government for downloading things or making them available to others.
