Does Megaupload work in all countries?
I just moved to Dubai, U.A.E from the US. And I wanted to download a file from Megaupload, but it does not work. It gives me this message:

Your IP address (I'm not going to post it) has just downloaded 82197731 bytes. Please wait 2 minutes, then try your download again.

But I did not download anything. Can someone help here, I really want this file.

They have a download limit, just wait for 2 min.
