How to fix this problem on Internet Explorer browser?
It just happened today. When I search web pages on Google, yahoo etc , and when I click " Back "  or " " Forward " arrow on the Toolbar nothing happens. I just can not return to te Previous page nor can i go to the next page. Is there any Shortcut on the keyboard which i could use for going back or forward?

.. And now you're all good.
yes, you can return to previous page pressing backspace key. to go next page press right arrow key but without clicking on the page........................................
Chrome and the newly released Opera 10.5 are THE best.
Opera 10.5 is the fastest browser along with chrome..It also sports a great number of features.
Chrome is just soo simple and fast.
Delete System32.
Get Google Chrome, Its the best browser out there.
