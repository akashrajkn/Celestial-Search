FORMSPRING MIXUUPP WHAT DO I SAY TO THEM?
Ok so a few days ago i got a formspring. everything was fine. then 2 days ago i left facebook and formspring up and my siblings had written on some girls formspring that she saw on the facebook homepage. I didn't notice what she had done until today when they wrote on another girls account. then i saw what she had written on girl 1's account. Then i write on it apologizing that it was a mistake and the wrong account and try to cover it up by completely changing the image of the account. (on both) i feel terrible about what had happened in just a few days and by thinking about how schools is gonna be tomorrow. hell. so i just made up fake questions to cover up the mess. Then it gets worse. people knew it was me and they were writing me questions that were rude so i disabled my account. How can i deal with this in school tomorrow? What do i do? Its gonna be awful i can see it coming. 


What the sibs had written on the formsprings are 

Girl 2: are you prude? (they know more than you think)
Girl 1: do you like _______________? (because i had said to them that i don't think that girl likes me. 


I got myself into a huge mess trying to cover their act and i wasn't creeping at all. How can i deal with this?

they think i wrote it.
i fail at life. 
i can't switch schools.
im screwed
don't say anything that wont help
please help me.  what would you do in this situation?

Just be honest and tell them your siblings are giant @sswipes who wanted to f*ck around on your accounts.
What do you want us to say? You screwed up! You aren't the first to do something this stupid! Nobody has ever died from doing something stupid like this! Suck it up, put on your big girl panties and deal with it!
