I'm 16. What do you think of my website?
hi i'm 16 ;)

in the future, i'd love to become a journalist /broadcast journalist. i've made a little news website it's www.arrowbristolnews.com - what could i improve on it, and, if you click on the main story, does it all make sense because apparently i can sound "confusing" at times. 

it just has news articles for Bristol because it'd take too long doing it for the whole of the UK. it also has some technology news on it. 

also, can you rate it out of 10? (1 being rubbish, 10 being brilliant) lol.

thanks for your time ;)
@Jim

you may think ?1 is a little amount, but paying ?1 extra 5 days a week is already ?5. 

In a month, thats ?20 extra you'd be paying. Would you fancy throwing ?20 down a drain? No.

Amateurish.

Hate the orange overlays.

Also the grammatical errors are annoying.
when i tried accessing it i got a "Domain not found" error ?
I would recommend fixing your grammar errors and changing the orange to something a little bit more subtle. Also, it might be fun to change the white background to a color that compliments the color of the overlays. Despite the formatting, the actual content is very impressive and I wish you luck on your dreams. :)
I like the layout of it and its easy to use but there is some text missing and you could of used more of the space but overall its good. 7/10
