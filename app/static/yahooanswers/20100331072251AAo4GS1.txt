Any ideas for a blogging?
Well I am starting a new blog and I don't want to sound like an idiot when I write my stuff. Hahaha Any ideas so i don't sound like an idiot?

Pick a niche that ur good of.
Ok here's what I think you should do. think hard and try and look for something that you really like. Don't worry about what other people think just make sure you find something you're passionate about and write about that. If you happen to like ants write about ants if you like mobile phones write about mobile phones. Just ask yourself this question. Would it be possible for you to write 3 interesting blog posts a week for 10 years without boring yourself out? If the answer is yes go for it.

You also need to be a part of a community of like minded people, check out this blogger forum and get an account http://acommunityforbloggers.com/ it's a great way to share your blogging experience with other bloggers and get some readers.
