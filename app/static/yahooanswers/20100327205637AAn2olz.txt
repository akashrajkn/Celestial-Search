Why does Internet Explorer keep having this problem? What to do?
I will navigate to certain webpages and while I am scrolling down it will freeze and when i click on the page somewhere trying to scroll down, it says "NOT RESPONDING"..

I have Windows Vista

How do I fix this problem?

What is wrong?

Windows Vista is the first problem.  Secondly, try downloading Mozilla Firefox.  Use it instead of IE
