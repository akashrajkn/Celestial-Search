How to sell novels on Chegg.com?
Okay so I saw this thing in seventeen mag that said that you can sell your novels for about $10 on chegg.com as well as textbooks. but when i went online. it ONLY had textbooks to sell. every novel i tried to sell said was "not eligable". So, is the ad in the magazine wrong, or am I doing something wrong?? Im confused.

No, chegg only buys textbooks mostly.  I have never been able to sell novels, only old textbooks.  They are great for renting books though.  If you ever rent or sell a textbook use code CC108488 to save/receive (depending on if you are selling or renting) an extra 5$ per order.  Chegg has saved me almost 400 dollars!
i saw the same ad in 17 magazine. i am trying to sell novels to 250 dollars worth!!!!! so i am very disapointed that they don't buy novels. but why does 17 mag say that??? im very confused about this to. such a bummer!!!!!
The ad probably meant to say textbooks. Chegg only deals with textbooks. But you can try http://www.bigwords.com They are primarily a textbook search engine that searches for the cheapest textbooks, but you can can actually use them to sell books too. And not just textbooks it will work for any kind of book. Just go to the site, and type in the title, author, or ISBN and when the results come up click "Sell" instead of "Buy". 

There ya go! Hope this was of help.
