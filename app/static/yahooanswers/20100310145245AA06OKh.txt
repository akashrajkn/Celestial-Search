try `` downloads.nl``
Downloading music never been legal, never will be. 
But you can always use blogs for getting direct downloading links for albums.
You can use this blog search by Google, will really help; http://blogsearch.google.com/
Try to search by this format: "Band/artist name - album name(year)"
try http://www.mp3obsession.com/
it's legal, safe and songs are 10 cents each.
