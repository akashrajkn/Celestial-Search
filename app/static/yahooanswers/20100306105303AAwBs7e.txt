What is your take and review on the website Chat Roulette?
I heard about Chat Roulette on the Daily Show- and when John  Stewart suggested there were a lot of 'free floating dongs' on that site, he was understating things-
I explored site for 3 hours yesterday and found very little  evidence of intelligent discussion- It was 90% pornographic 5% jerks who did nothing but insult me, 4 %  20-something guys cruising for hot women,and 1% interesting people ready to have intelligent discussion.

I thought the big reason so many people are rude and obnoxious on message boards boards is because they can hide behind their computer screen-but with this site, where your face invisible- I thought people would be at their best- but it's the opposite-

I think chat roulette has an aspect of communications  that will be commonplace in telecommunications in the next 10 years- I think within 10 years all telephones will have an interactive real time video component-- But Chat Roulette is pure anarchy.

I'm not interested in seeing middle  aged guys whack  off, so i'm not going back.

If you visited the site- what did you think. Does it have any redeeming qualities- or is it a free-for all freak show?
The segment on the Daily Show was frickin hilarious- John Stewart  was right, everytother person on ChatRoulette is some guy pounding his pud...

You answered your own question. In two words, "it's irresponsible." (I saw the same Jon Stewart show, it was funny, lol)
