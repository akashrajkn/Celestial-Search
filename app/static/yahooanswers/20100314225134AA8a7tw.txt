why won't airg let me use it on my phone anymore?
i've been trying to get onto airg on my mobile phone for awhile now,
but everytime i try it just says "internal error"
why won't it let me use it anymore? D:

it just recently updated its possible the firmware on the phone is not working right with the new version
