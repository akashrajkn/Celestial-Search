Where can I find a free forum or how can I create a blog where I can post/host several 18+ art?
I have tons of fan made and professional made 18+ art (drawings, sketches, animated pictures, etc.) stored in my computer.
Where can I find a forum or something like it to easily share all those pictures for free?
Or how can I make an accessible blog with the common 18+ Warning where I can host the images for free?

Free sites are much too limited in their bandwidth allotment to make it useful to you.  You would run out of your allotment before the first day was over!

i didnt use it. but a lot of my friends are. its is like your public diary! where u can blog about yourself and share everything on facebook if you want
I'd recommend http://www.forumotion.com

It's much easier to use than other forum hosters...And there are events you can take part in to win free domain names,ect for your forum you created.
They allow your 18+ work.
