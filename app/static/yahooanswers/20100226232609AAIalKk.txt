Why would you want to watch that?? It's kind of a little bit sick, watching somebody die... don't you think?
I know it's kinda sick, but I was curious about it too. I mean, someone in the audience must have had their camera going during the accident, and must have posted it on youtube. But I checked youtube, and there's nothing there. (I'm guessing that anyone who might have posted it, had it taken down by authorities.) There's at least one hoax though. The video starts out with WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE. Then it's a still photo of a trainer and a whale, with talking bubbles singing through an 80's song. Haha.
The incident happened AFTER the main show had finished and there where only a few people present for the after show feeding.

I would wager that that seaworld asked anybody who did have footage to be sensitive and not distribute the footage.

I wouldn't want a video of my loved one dying on the internet........would you?
