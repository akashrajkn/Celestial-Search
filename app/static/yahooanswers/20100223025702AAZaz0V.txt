Deleting @replies on Twitter.?
If you send someone an @reply on Twitter as a message, then decide you dont want them to receive it afterall- so you delete it from your tweets. Will they still get it?
Forgot to mention that the person is not following me, but I am following them. So, despite me sending the @reply. Once it's sent, it's sent. If I delete it, it wont prevent them from getting?
