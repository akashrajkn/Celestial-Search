Question about PayPal?
I deleted my PayPal account yesterday as I thought I didn't need one and now I need a new one! 
My question is why can't I add my card to this new account?

'Before you can add this credit card to another account, you must contact the PayPal Credit Card Team at cardproblems@paypal.com. A Customer Service Representative will respond to your request shortly. If you would rather add a different credit card to your PayPal account, you may do so at any time. Thank you for your cooperation.'

Why is this?
I would add another card - If I had one !!

It's  like you found somebody elses card, you need to clear that up, which is why you should talk to customer service.
