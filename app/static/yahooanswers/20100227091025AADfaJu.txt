How do you find your twitter account without signing in?
I lost the password to my twitter account and I really want to see the things I posted on there. Sadly, no one followed me except me and a couple of my friends. Now I want to find my twitter page but there's no real twitter user search. What can I do?

If you have forgotten your password, go onto the homepage and click the sign in drop down button. There will be a link saying 'Forgotten your password?'. Click it and type in your email address or username and they will send you instructions to get your password via email.
If for some reason you do not want to/can not do this then if you can remember your twitter username, you can type in www.twitter.com/[your username] and that will be your page. If not you may have to make another twitter account with a different email (which can be easily made on www.msn.com) and then search for your old account on there using the 'Find People' button.
