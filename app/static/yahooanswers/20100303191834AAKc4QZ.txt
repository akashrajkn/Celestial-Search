You can use Skype or something similar to do this, but it is only free when you are making a call to the other person's Skype client. If you want to make calls to someone's landline or cell phone, you have to pay for the call.  I have not priced it myself, but I believe it is still cheaper to make an international call through Skype than through a cell phone or landline.

Sorry to say there is no such thing as FREE outgoing phone calls,

But do not give up.
