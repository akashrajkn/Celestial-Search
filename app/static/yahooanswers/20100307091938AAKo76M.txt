Do I Have to have a Paypal account in order to buy off of Ebay?


No, you have to use paypal, but not have an account with them. It will just ask you for credit card info, etc and you use it as a checkout site..If you know what I mean?
You do not need a paypal account but you may be restricted in buying items - Most sellers only accept payments from verified paypal users
Paypal offers buyer protection should you not receive your item or its not as described.  The buyer protection is only valid if you have a account (not 100% sure on this, check paypals FAQs or contact them if concerned)
So I guess what Im saying is while you do not have to have one, it is recommended.
