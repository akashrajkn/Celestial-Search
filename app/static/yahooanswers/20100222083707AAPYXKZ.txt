try ventones.com and remember that  iphones take mp3 formats. Using ventones can allow you to create and download your own ringtones using a collection of songs from your playlist.

if that doesnt work then you can also try

phonezoo.com
funformobile.com
myxer.com

all of these worked for me. However I have verizon and not an iphone. Hope it works
You can download it ur laptop and then upload it to ur phone.
