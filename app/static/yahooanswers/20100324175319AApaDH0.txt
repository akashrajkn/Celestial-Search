Will lockerz ever have a 24/7 store?
Do they plan on upgrading to that instead of random redemption days or are they going to keep it how it is?

Yes. Once it launches it will be 24/7.
Yeah, they're trying to get a crazy freaking huge amount of members or something like that so they can make money off the site, then open the 24/7 store.
