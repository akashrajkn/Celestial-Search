Company want my twitter account.  How much is it worth?
A company contacted me and wants to buy my twitter account because the username matches their company name.  What is the account worth?  What should I ask for?

It depends on the Company. For instance if you had the name "Fritos", you could get a tidy sum. If you have "Joe Shmoe's Deli" then you aren't going to get too much. :)
how big is this company and what sort of traffic will they have?
if it was me tell them ?1,000, they dont have any particular value but if their hearts set on that name then might as well be a prick about it and make some money eh! ;-)
Say no until they offer you higher sums. If you don't think it is worth it then say no. If it's a big company then you might want to sell it.
