Firefox Password help..?
Okay, so my facebook used to remember my passwords, but then i changed my password, so obviously the original was only remembered and i had to keep typing me new one.

So i went onto Tools > Options > Privacy and deleted the list of all facebook passwords stored, in the hope that it would ask for my new one.
It never happened.

I also checked the Exceptions, and its not in there.
Its just.. not happening.
How can I prompt Mozilla Firefox to ask me to remember passwords again?

Possibly a couple more options to set.  Try this:


1.Click the Tools->Options menu item. (What else?)
2.Click the Privacy tab.
3.If the Always clear my private data when I close Firefox checkbox is checked, either uncheck it or click the Settings button next to it.
4.If you clicked the Settings button, make sure the Saved Passwords checkbox is clear.
5.OK out of everything.
6.Click the Tools->Options menu item again.
7.Click the Security tab.
8.Make sure the Remember Passwords for Sites checkbox is checked.
9.If it already is, click the Exceptions button to see if your sites have somehow been put in the exception list.
10.OK out of everything again.

Hope that helps.
Try going to Tools --> Option --> Security and work with the Password option there.  It may be turned off
