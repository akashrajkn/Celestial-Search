Wireless internet password?
I want to put a password on my wifi connection, and I went to the site <192.168.1.1> and I must've typed something in wrong, and my computer won't bring me back to the site. What do I do?

Connect with a lan cable.  That will work and allow you to connect and change settings.
reset your routerr.
Pressing the router/modem with a pin sized object in the tiny hole for about 10 sec should reset it. Every setting might be erased to factory default.
