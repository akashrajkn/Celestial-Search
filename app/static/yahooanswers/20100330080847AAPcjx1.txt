Anyone know any sites like craigslist or better?
I need a site that is like craigslist.org - please help!

Ebay, possibly?
craigslist is likely your best bet, unless you want to look in the newspaper's advertisement section. craigslist is ideal due to the fact that it's local. ebay and amazon both are cheap and both have used products but for buying something such as a car or boat you would not want to use either.
I find that www.amplezone.com is just like craigslist.org for classified ads that are free. Amplezone.com has a great simple interface, many users, and I suggest it to everyone to use it, best of all, it's free. I hope I helped!
