Need help with paypal :(?
Ive bought something via paypal and it was out of stock but i paid for it anyway and i emailed them and i got a refund but the money is in my paypal account because when i go to my bank the money isnt in my bank. Do you know how i could transfer it? 
Thanks

just click on "Withdraw" and follow the instructions
There is a facility to do this on the PayPal site. Just look carefully
If your PayPal Account isn't attached to your bank, you need to attach it first. To do this go to My Account->Profile>Bank Accounts->Add a Bank Account->Enter Details and follow confirming instructions

Once you have attached your bank account go to My Account->Withdraw->Bank account in {Country}->Choose amount->Click ok->Click confirm
leave it there and buy something else.  it cost money to withdraw it, if its a small amount.
