When is the day of the general redemption on Lockerz?
When is the day for the general redemption for Lockerz? I know today is the day of the second wave but I didn't sign up, when will the general redemption open for us who didn't sign up for the waves?

Well they said that they wont announce a date before hand but it has to happen before the end of the month so between Feb 26 - 28. Hope this helped.
the date is today.
