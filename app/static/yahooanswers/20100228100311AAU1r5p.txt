Why does a yfrog.com link not work in Firefox?
Why does a yfrog.com link ( http://yfrog.com/2e47044607j ) not work in Firefox (i get a page saying bad gateway) but  work in Internet Explorer?

It works for me, using firefox.
Try going to http://yfrog.com, then log out and back in to re-establish the link to Twitter.
