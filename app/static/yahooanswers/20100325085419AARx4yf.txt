What happen if there is this type of website?
what do u say if there is such a kind of website which have all the following feature it below a roof only.
- Video (like Youtube)
- Pic uploading (like Flickr)
- E-mail(like Yahoo)
- Friends (like Facebook)
- Movie & Music buying (like Istore)
- Web chat (like Yahoo messenger)
How much u rate that website (*/10)?

10 of course!
8/10
10/10 email me on yahoo, i could help you out as I can code. I am a kid and I know what people at my age would like on these things. If you want it for adults i suggest you make some kind of security feature. If you don't mind kids on it, something which will get you many members is to hire moderators and have an intergrated panic button.
Those websites are all very good at what they specialise in, unless you can do it very very well, and get up a good reputation it will not work. You need some serious funding.
