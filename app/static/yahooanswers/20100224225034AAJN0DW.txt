Are the jobs posted in Craigslist real or fake?


real. no one would waste their time posting fake jobs unless they have problems. craigslist is legit.
some are real, some are scams.  do your research and ask questions.
depends on how amazing they are. if they are $10,000 a day stuffing envelopes..YES
In any community oriented website you have to take any information with a grain of salt.

Most job offers are probably legit, but some are probably fake.

Check the layout of the text, if it's one big block of text it's probably a fake.  If there are images that don't have anything to do with the job it's probably fake.  If there's a ton of grammar mistakes it's probably a fake
most of them are real.
