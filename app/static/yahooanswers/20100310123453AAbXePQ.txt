wireless internet access?
Like the verison where you get a contract for your internet and plug it into a usb port.  Is there a place to get one prepay or by the month with no contract?

Hi,

yes, you can get pre-paid internet dongles from phone shops. not the best internet but is ok of quality for money.

thanks
Yes, absolutely!  You can get 3G technology which is quite fast.  I use it as my ONLY Internet connection at home.  Here's a free resource to compare plans:
