how much money do people typically proxy bid on ebay?
theres this thing that i REALLY want and right now there is 1 bid and it's at $11.99. i want to wait until the last minute to avoid other bidders upping their bid if they see my bid. so at the last minute i plan on bidding $50.00. but i really don't want to pay that much. if you had to take a guess, what do you think that other bidders highest proxy bid would be? i reeeeealllllly want what im going to bid on!!

Its hard to say?

I know if I really want something, I will snipe it with 5 seconds to go with the absolute max I am prepared to pay. However if theres something I like but dont really care whether I win the bid  I will generally bid  with days to go & maybe $1 to 5 hgiher then the start price. 

Everyone has different bidding techniques.

Is this item highly sort after, how many days does it have? I will give you my best guess LOL & say  their max bid will be $15.00. Of course there might be other bidders come along in the meantime.

My advice if you are prepared to pay $50 then bid $50. Also add a couple of cents to your max bid as most people tend to bid in whole dollars. Cant tell you how many times I have won the bid by one cent.
