How did that person on chatroulette know my name?
I did some embarrassing things on chatroulette, and they were like "okay john, i'm gonna post this on your facebook and youtube. nice guitar skills btw" IT'S FREAKING ME OUT. fuuuuck

Maybe they recognized you? I never go on chatroulette it's full of creeps.
that person actually knew you.
hahahahahahahha unlucky mate, how embarrassing! They probs knew you somehow, just be more careful you don¡¯t know them next time!
look around your room, see if there is anything that might give it away, or maybe they just took a lucky shot, afterall, john is the most common name!
lolol must have been someone who already knew you! The same thing happened to me on Facebuzz.com!
