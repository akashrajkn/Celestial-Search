There are programs for creating web sites.
http://webs.com
There are two ways of making a Website. You can use (W)hat (Y)ou (S)ee (I)s (W)hat (Y)ou (G)et. Freewebs is a example of that.

Or you can code it. Coding gives you much more control over how your website looks.

Everything you need is already on your computer. A Web Browser. A text editor. And some time.

Here are some beginner links to learn how to make websites:

Hope this helps.
its easy to make a website.

You can either use:
>>Adobe Flash
or
>>Macromedia Dream Weaver

I use Dreamweaver to make my websites. 

To make a website is easy. To publish the website is hard. You need to also get sponsers to sponser your website if its worldwide, and even domestically.
