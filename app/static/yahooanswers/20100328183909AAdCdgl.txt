SKYPE Question.(10 points to best answer)!!!?
What do I need to call landlines and cellphones?(other than Skype credit)
Do I need a special microphone,or a headset?or something like that.
I have a microphone and speakers built into my laptop.
Thanks

That's fine. I'm pretty sure that's all you need aside from Skype credit.
All younee is a mic and speakers with the skype creidt =]
Nope, it's just like a regular skype call. 
The quality is generally a little worse than you would expect from a handset or landline phone, as you are talking to a laptop and all. Then again, it does depend on how good your built in mic is. 

But they do have a reputation for being notoriously bad. 
If you were planning on using Skype to make a lot of landline calls, I'd recommend picking up a good headset, just so people can hear you better.
