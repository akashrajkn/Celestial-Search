What is the Pain Series on Encyclopedia Drama?
I got it linked from a friend, but I think it's actually a Rick Roll. Or something like that..

DUDE. Do NOT click on it. Unless of you want to be scarred for the rest of your life. All the disgustingness in the world in one jpeg. Nasty stuff.
I get a headache of clicking on it. Have you ever see 2 girls 1 cup? 3 guys 1 hammer? BME pain olympics? 1 horse 1 man? church of fudge? zippocat? now imagine all them, and 100 things even worse, all in one jpeg. image (in other words, 1 SINGLE PHOTO)
