I hope it would be helpfully for you
No one knows which proxies will work at your school. However, if you try a few of them you'll find one that isn't blocked!

You need to go to a site which has lists of proxies. I recommend:
 http://snipurl.com/thelostsite
which lists loads and allows you to easily try them out.

Good luck!
use 1 of the below

dogtype.info

Web filters get more sophisticated every day. They can scan and detect proxies as soon as you try to use them. The most advanced systems can block you within seconds. Others send a report to the admin and the block is done manually.

The name of the proxy, how new it is, whether it¡¯s https or not does not matter. The proxy will be detected and blocked because it¡¯s a proxy.

There is also considerable risk in using free proxies from unknown sources. Many of these free proxies are what are called hacker pots. They are there waiting for you to fall into their trap so they can steal your information and plant bots on your computer. Once a bot is planted the hacker has control of your machine and can steal credit cards, attack web sites and send out tons of spam all from your IP address.

Some of the free proxies are run by people out to make money. There is nothing wrong with that in principle. However the best case here is that you will get a proxy loaded with advertisements with no real speed to it. The amount of money the owner can make with advertising clicks is really only pennies. Many of these owners supplement their income by key logging everything you do and selling your personal information to advertising companies. Since you have no way to know what the owner is actually doing you need to assume the worst case is true.

My favorite proxy to use is http://www.guardtunnel.com - works at my school.

It has like everything - Facebook/YouTube/MySpace support, SSL Encryption (very hard to block, and safe to use), not too many ads, and its really fast!  Plus it has an ad-free version that I use, you just gotta fill out a quick 2 minute survey - http://www.guardtunnel.com/ad-free/

Hope I helped you out!
