can i erase stories from my profile?

look up how to erase my profile on fanfiction.net
Go to fanfiction.net and login. When you login and you come to the page with all the tabs (account, publish, inbox, etc.), go to the publish tab. Then go to my stories. Click the story you want to delete. When you click it and it brings you to the edit story page, near the top right is a "delete story" option. Click that, and your story is gone =)
