Try enabling compatibility mode. It is the broken page icon next to the refresh button on the toolbar. Here¡¯s a good resource from the IEBlog that talks about compatibility mode in detail if you¡¯d like to learn more: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx 

If that doesn¡¯t work, run IE in No Add-ons Mode.  Go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) - If this fixes the issue, then go to Tools -> Manage Add-ons and enable the add-ons one by one to find which one was causing the problem. 

You can also try resetting Internet Explorer's settings by going to Tools > Internet Options and then the "Advanced" tab, and click "Reset..." 

If you¡¯re still not having any luck, I recommend you reinstall IE8 on your system.

I hope this helps!
