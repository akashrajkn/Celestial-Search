On Twitter, can they read your tweets?
Can the people that you are following, but are not following you, read your tweets? Mine are not public.

If your Twitter account is set to Private, only those who you allow to follow you will see your tweets. For example, I have a public account and you start following me but I don't follow you back and you have a private account. You are able to see my tweets but I'm not able to see yours unless I start following you and you accept me. Hope I didn't confuse you. lol
