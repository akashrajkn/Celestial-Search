Where can I watch TV/movies online for free? LEGALLY!?
My computer. monitor's AV quality is much better than my television's AV quality so I wanted to watch movies and television on here. I have a DVD drive on my computer, but I can't seem to find my copy of T2 and I wanted to watch it on here. I want a clean website that I can watch TV or movies on legally, as I do not want some black vans pulling up in my driveway.

http://www.hulu.com is your best bet.  Otherwise, get a TV Tuner card.
You really can't, and if there's a site that offers it, it's illegal for that site to be up hosting that stuff, with the exception of Hulu I suppose, but it offers a few free episodes at a time, and you have to buy it when you want to watch it if they don't have it offered for free.

Just buy the things on iTunes, the episodes are only a couple bucks and the movies to rent are about 4 or 5, and to buy are about 15 (or maybe less, depending on the movie).
