Sites where you can stream music for free (Not Last FM)?
Does anyone know any good sites where I can stream music for free? I've tried Last FM, but I live in Canada, so I have to pay for it.

I'm talking about sites like imeem (before it closed down) or myspace music. Any site where you can find an artist, pick a song and listen to it right on the browser.

go to www.xlivewire.com and click on music, it has a list of sites for you to use that are free and are very good.
Try Pandora. You select a song or artist that you like and Pandora builds a list of songs that they estimate you'll also like. It's really cool and free.

Try Blip.fm. Everyone is a "DJ" you choose "DJs" to follow and listen to their music as its being updated or you simply find tunes within the site and "DJ" them out and build a list
