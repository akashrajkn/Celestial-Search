Not in the UK. 

That is privileged information and is protected by the Data Protection Act 1998 and under Article 8, The Right to Privacy, Human Rights Act 1998, EU Convention.

That site given to you in your other answer would be no good to you anyway because it is a US one.

As regards Births, Marriages & Deaths they are a matter for Public Record. Some sites you have to be registered to use them and some charge as well.
