Internet Browser History?
Why or what could have deleted my browsing history if I didnt do it. I dont think I have windows Defender, but I do have Norton Anti Virus could this delete my history?

maybe it could have been someone else who logged on to your pc
Did you ever run your Disk Cleanup? Sometimes it'll clean all of that up.
if it detected a cookie it might have. if it thought it was getting thruogh to your history, it might have deleted it to keep things from lookin at it.
