I can't log out of my twitterific account on my iphone.?
I've changed my password today - and when I tried to use Twitter on my iphone it says Your current login information was not accepted by Twitter.  I can't find out how to log out and back in again with my new password - can anybody help me please?

Restart the phone.
delete it and then re-download it for free.
