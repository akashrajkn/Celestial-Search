If I don't have a Formspring account, but ask a question, will it be anonymous?
I don't have a Formspring account, so it doesn't provide the "Anonymous" option when I want to ask a question. Will it still be anonymous if I ask a question, even if I ask it while signed on to my Facebook account?

Yes it is still anonymous if you ask a question, as long as you are not logged on to a formspring account. Non of your information will be seen, regardless of you being on facebook, because when you want to ask a question, it leads you to the formspring page to ask it.
yuuppppp its all anonymous
