Problem with YouTube?
I have Opera as my internet browser, and whenever I try to watch videos on YouTube, I get told to download Adobe Flash Player to play the videos, but even though I have installed it, I can't watch the videos. I don't want to change browser because my laptop works best with Opera, so is there anything else I can do?

Hope this website helps:
