Hi there. I don't think you can turn your browser off, close it yes but not off. And if you close it then how will you view the web pages! Add more details please so this can be more clear.
Thanks
That is your Web Browser and this indicates you are on a web site that is considered not to be safe for one reason or another. It may be scanning for information on your computer. This is normally a security alert. However I have never seen that before. So at this point I am only guessing that is the reason for that message.
