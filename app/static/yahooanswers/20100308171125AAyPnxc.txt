Why are some proxy sites unsafe?
Im not sure if i should use them or not because somebody told me they can be unsafe but they never said why?

They can log your account names and or passwords if you log into a site through them.  If they do, they can use them for malicious purposes, or sell them.  It is especially dangerous if you use a credit card through a proxy for the aforementioned reasons.
