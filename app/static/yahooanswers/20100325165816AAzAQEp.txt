Help I prank-called someone, and in the background I heard them say they know who it is. What should I do?
She did something bad to me, so I just wanted to get back with a joke. 
And she cussed at me, does that mean I can go to jail? Please respond IMMEDIATELY!

If you didn't sexually harass or endanger her life in anyway youll probably be alright.  Most people dont like police getting involved in things anyways
Don't worry. She probably doesn't even know it's you, unless she says your name, she's bluffing. No doubt. People say that all the time.
She also probably just discovered there is no Santa Claus.  Don't worry about it.
