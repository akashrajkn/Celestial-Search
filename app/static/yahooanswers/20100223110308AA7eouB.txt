is it a bad idea to buy a .co.uk domain if the .com version is taken but not being used?


No, it's a good idea if you are a company dealing primarily in the UK!  

     I am often frustrated by searching for car-parts online, and then getting a response, e.g. "Clutch specialists in Hampshire", will give me a load of results, I might be reading one that seems ok, and then find it is in New Hampshire, the prices are in dollars, they don't have parts for my car, and arrgghh, I want companies near me in England!
If I were you I tried to find a .com domain name which is more popular. People more memorize com extension.

Take into consideration that web hosting is a global service. It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or India. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
