Just download IE 7 and reinstall, you can go uninstall IE8 first if you want from windows components on your Programs and features or Add and remove programs.


Good luck :)
Download IE 7 here http://www.soft32.com/download_997.html, then uninstall IE 8 then install IE 7 from the file you downloaded there.
