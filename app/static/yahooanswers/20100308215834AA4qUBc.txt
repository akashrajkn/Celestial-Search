where to report inappropriate websites?
I heard of this website where people take videos of animals heads being chopped off and things of that nature and upload the videos to their website, and I feel like that is very disgusting and wrong. I am wondering if there is a way for me to report the website, but I don't know who exactly I would tell.

If the website does illegal stuff,
you can check out this website, it explains a little bit:

I also heard that police departments usually have a non emergency number you can call to report it.
