what does this error mean?
Coppermine critical error:
Unable to connect to database !

MySQL said: Access denied for user 'lolisam'@'localhost'


i got it when i tried going to a site that was saved under my favorites.
any help is greatly appreciated :)

The website owner needs to update their code or database settings because the username - password that they use to "login" to their database is incorrect. Nothing you can do other than contacting the website's owner or tech person to fix it.
