How to use a picture as an avatar?
If I find a picture on the internet and I want to use it as an avatar but can't find who 'owns' the picture, can I use it as an avatar? Or even as a background image?
Also, if there is a pic of a celebrity I want to use in (for example) my blog, can I just use it?

as long as your not selling it or for any kind of profit use your ok
Follow these Steps

1) Log in to profiles.yahoo.com
2) Slide your mouse cursor to your profile Photo.You can see "Change Photo" button.Click it
3) Click "Add Photo" Button in the Select Photo Dialog box.
4) Place your cursor in the browse box to select the desired image from your Hard-disk after you       have downloaded it from Internet.
5) Now you can see your desired image kept as your profile avatar...Viola!!!
Just use it, I haven't a clue who "owns" the photo I use as my avatar and nobody has told me off yet.  If its copyrighted you won't be able to save it to your computer.
