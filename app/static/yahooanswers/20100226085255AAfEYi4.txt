Your download speed is limited by your ISP (or the phone line between your house and BT exchange) .. a new Router is not going to make any difference UNLESS your ISP is offering ADSL+ and yopur old router is unable to cope ...

TYPICALLY you get 2mbs from your ISP (some Virgin cable accounts claim 20mbs) to your Router

From Router to PC you use either WiFi  (at 54mbs) or cable Ethernet (at 100mbs) .. in other words the link to your PC is NEVER the bottleneck .. and running 'tcp optimiser' on your PC is generally a waste of time ... 

Utilities do exist that instruct the web servers you visit to 'compress' data before sending it .. this only really makes a difference if you are on 'dial up' (often the web Server takes longer doing the compression than it would have done just doing the download)

Better, of course, is to prevent your PC from downloading all the 'multi-media' crap (video clip adverts, background music) that clogs up your connection .. so getting Firefox with Adblock Plus, Flashblock and NoScript can really make a difference .... and it's worth installing a "download manager" (eg FlashGot for Firefox) if you right click and 'save as' large files such as full length movies ...

During 'peak' hours it's likely that your ISP is limiting your speed simply due to the number of people on line .. and you will, no doubt, be aware that your ISP may well be limiting your speed if you are doing lots of large downloads ..
