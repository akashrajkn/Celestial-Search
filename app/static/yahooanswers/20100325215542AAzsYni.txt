trying to use my friends internet, dont know the wifi password?
its through comcast internet
where do i find the password?
help!
im not stealing. i have permission, idiot.

go to www.lemonparty.org , they can help u hack the internet password really quickly, and it wont damage the computer
It's usually the phone number associated with the account. If that's not it and your friend doesn't know/remember the code, call up the provider and they should be able to help.
Either ask them for their password, or quit trying to steal internet service!
