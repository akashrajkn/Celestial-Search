how does lockerz work?
i heard about lockerz... and everybodt says its real, so i signed up!!!
i watched a person talk about lockerz and he said, when you redeem a prize... you're entered in a sweepstakes/contest for that item? it is true, or does it automatically give you the prize?
please answer :) thank you
is it hard to win prizes?
where do they get the money to afford this stuff?

First of all redeeming a prize is hard to do, usually in under a minute the good stuff is gone. But, if you redeem a prize you get it. Sometimes people get their prizes cancelled though, I'm not sure why.

-- They just started "Play" and I know they make money from the advertisement on the videos. But, I'm not sure where the money came from before.
hasnt worked for me. i got enouph and i am waiting 1 month they keep on saying out of stock
