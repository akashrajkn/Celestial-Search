Best Sites To Listen To Online Music For Free?
I am compiling a list of sites to listen to music online for free.  So far I have: seeqpod, listen77, justhearit, playlist, muziic, dizzler, listen, jango, we7, songza, spool, grooveshark, last, pandora.  I am primarily looking for sites that have an enormous amount of music available, ie obscure older songs, and very good sound quality.  So if you know of any others not listed here that meet that criteria, I would greatly appreciate knowing of them.  Thanks!

There should never be any charge for listening to music online.  It is downloading that is the problem because that is equivalent to a sale
You can listen to music and download any song free www.bomb-mp3.com
I'd suggest places like Last.fm, Slacker Radio, AOL Radio and any number of radio stations that are already listed in iTunes under the "Radio" icon.
http://www.ShareTheMusic.com is legal service for share and listen to mp3¡¯s for free. You have to register and download software, but it¡¯s worth it. On the website users can share their music preferences with friends - create and manage playlists, view related artists, like or dislike artists, albums and songs, create or join thematic groups and check profile statistics.  Moreover, it¡¯s a great possibility of meeting new people who love the same music.
