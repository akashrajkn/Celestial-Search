how do i get rid of a trojan?
i have a trojan and its not letting me on to my ie

use spybot search and destroy or just stop watching so much porn
Get a horse, put a bunch of men in side, and offer it as a gift. Wait till they bring you inside, then at night fall exit the horse and attack.
Scan ur system using sybot search and destroy, download it of here http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html , then update it, then scan ur system and fix problems
1. Firefox rocks you should totally use it (just my plug)
2. Download Malewarebytes http://www.malwarebytes.org/  the free trial. Its really powerful and got rid of any trojans I had.
Malwarebytes is the absolute best program for finding spyware, adware and stuff like that. It will also work in safemode. (Press F8 to get into safemode when your computer is starting up)
