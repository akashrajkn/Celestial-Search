What is a forum because I need to know?


If you are talking about an internet forum, it's just an area on the internet to chat with one another.  A forum will usually be in the form of a message board, where you can post a question or comment and someone can respond.  Hmm....sounds familiar?

Forums will always have a theme or topic, such as computers, cars, hobbies, etc.
Technically, it's like a discussion room. People talk about different things in forums. Depending on the site, it can be music, games, shows, movies, etc. They really aren't anything that special. They're just message boards. People even ask questions in forums and others can give their opinion. It is sort of like yahoo answers, but slightly different.
According to Merriam-Webster:
