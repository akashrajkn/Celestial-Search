if i videochat using skype, is it free?
it says i have to download it 1st though, will it slow my labtop down? i dont want to make calls or any of the other crap, just videochat
oh, and can i actually hear the other person, and talk to them? no typing?

yes it should be free for just videochat

if you have enough RAM, a good processor and graphics card, your laptop should be able to handle it
yes Skype provides you free voice chat,no typing.
you cant call to mobiles for free.
and installing Skype will not make your computer slow or lack of space problem because it is a small installation program and for more precaution you can install it in d drive or any other drive other than c.

and if you don't want to install software but still wanna make video chat you can use Orkut for that, as i feel its good and simple.
i use it daily atleast an hour.
