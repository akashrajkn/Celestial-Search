Nigerian's put my house on Craigslist?
Yesterday, a woman came to my house to notify me that my house is on Craigslist! She said it was probably Nigerian's and some sort of scam. There is pictures of my house (inside/and out) on there. It has all the info, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, etc. I for sure did not put my house on there, and it says "For Rent" and the price. What should I do?!?!

Contact Craigslist and have them take down the ad. But once the scammers have your pictures, they will keep using them on other sites and there's really nothing you can do. Was your house listed on a legitimate site anytime in the past 5 years? if so that's how they got them, they copy pictures and descriptions from legitimate sites,then pretend they are the owner and ask people to send them deposits before they send the keys. In London some scammer had "rented" the same property to 17 people without the real owner knowing.
