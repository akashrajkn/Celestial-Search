Why am I not getting Internet connection? FULL POINTS! HELP!?
What the hell, my moms computer has wireless connection,
my itouch has connection, and all of a sudden my laptop doesn't?
It's a 1 year old windows vista. I click under get Internet connection,
and it says it can't find my router. Well, my router works
fine for my moms computer. I'm getting damn frusterated.

Any tips on what I can do?
I already tried unplugging my router. It's not helping.
Already did........

Not curse in your question is one thing you can do! Try rebooting the router!
