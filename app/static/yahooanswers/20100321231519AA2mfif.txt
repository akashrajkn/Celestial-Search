Firefox slowing down?
It seems like pages are taking longer to load and crashing more. What's wrong with firefox? is there a way to speed it up? My computer seems to be fine but just this. I have the newest version too. help?!

Firefox is a good browser, but it is slow just like IE. Try Google Chrome.
