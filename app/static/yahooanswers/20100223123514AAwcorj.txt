why are the links on mydeardiary.com not working?
finally mydeardiary.com is back, but for some reason the links for the diaries aren't working and everytime i click on one a 404 error page comes up saying something about it not being available on this server....? i don't understand computers much...so is it something to do with my computer or the site?

It's the site, not you. Nothing you can do until they fix it.
It's not your computer. On my computer it isn't working too. MyDeardiary had some complications on financial problem. Problem on paying the site if I'm correct. For now you can go to foreverdita.com
It looks exactly like mydeardiary. And it is safe. the Mydeardiary.com is now Bored.com
