Can I Discover Someone's Name & Address Just From Their Landline Number?
Would anyone know where (maybe a website), you can obtain the name and address of a phone caller, just with their UK landline number for reference?
Many thanks.

yes if their number isnt ex-directory. it would be in the white pages (name only)
you can do a reverse search on the number or google it
No, not in the UK, reverse searches are against the Data Protection Act.

More info about it here:
you can google it :)get anyone address
I think only the police can do that.
no you cant the reason I know is that I was an telecommunications engineer and it is not allowed under the data protections act,  If you know a persons Name and address you can get  their number for the phone directory and that's all , just try and call directory enquiries and ask for the name and address of a person 
with just a phone number and see what sort of answer you will get they will not give you that information because it would be illegally. so if you have the number then call it and get the address and name that way
but I bet their is a hidden season you will not do that I hope I have explained and helped you with the answer
No sorry not in the UK. We do not do reverse phone numbers.

All that is protected by the Data Protection Act of 1998 which is also backed up by the Right to Privacy under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, European Convention 1998.
