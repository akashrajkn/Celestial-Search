Hi...

try this website - http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/
http://www.walkyourselffit.com/uof/walkyourselffit/

Walking yourself fit is great and its fun and helps by getting in shape. Its free too and get you too see places and people. I started with 4 miles then gradually increased it 8 miles then 15. i lost 3 stone.
in all honesty, the easiest thing to do is go to google and type in the exact phrases you're asking for to get a million good websites. some ones i personally recommend for that is the "better homes and garden" website. also any cooking/home magazines usually provide great tips on food plans, workout regimens, health and overall basic nutrition. good luck!
