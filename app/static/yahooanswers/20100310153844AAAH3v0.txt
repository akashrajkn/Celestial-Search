How do I uninstall internet explorer?
I have windows vista and I installed Google chrome and now I want to uninstall Internet Explorer. I do not know which one it is (7 or 8) and it is not in the uninstall list.

It's an integrated part of Windows and cannot be uninstalled. Just ignore it.
You can't remove it completely as it is a standard part of Windows.

Additionally, if something goes wrong with Chrome, you'll have a backup.
Don't bother.

Some websites can't be accessed by other browsers still and its always good to have a backup.
Steps for Windows Vista or for Windows Server 2008
To uninstall Internet Explorer 8, follow these steps:

   1. Close all programs.
   2. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
   3. Click Uninstall a Program under the Programs category
   4. In the Tasks pane, click View installed updates.
   5. In the list of installed updates, double-click Windows Internet Explorer 8.
It's impossible. It is an integrated part of the operating system, and does not show up in the add or remove program list. Leave it be, just remove it as the default web browser.
