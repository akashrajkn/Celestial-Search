Has anyone used this site?!?
Has anyone used movies-opening.com to watch a movie?  I wanted to watch a movie so i looked it up on you tube and one of the  videos gave me a link to go to that website and i was just wondering if it was safe to use, and if not do you recommend any other movie sites?

this site is safe 

www.movies-links.tv/
Site is not safe and should not be trusted.

If you want to watch movie either download them from itunes, rent them, buy them or go to fancast.com or hulu.com
