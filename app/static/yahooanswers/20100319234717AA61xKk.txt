Is this site offline for you?
I already asked this question 1 hour ago, but it appears to not be working again. 
http://gamingrant.com/
I tried updating the site, and for some reason it is offline.. again. 
Does it work for you?
My host is Yahoo, and they shouldn't be messing up, should they? 
I mean, they should be reliable, so it has to be something I did, right? 
Last time I asked this question it magically started working again, lol..  That is why I did it again, hoping it might start working.
@Tony: 
Thanks for including a link to my other question..

Yep, it's timing out.

Call your host and chew them out.
Yes it is offline dude ! (im in mexico)
it wont let me open it D:
No, when you work offline it means you don't have a good online connection. And mine always works which is odd
Yes, it is offline
site is loading extremely slowly and then quits. I only get a partial load. my browser shows only a blank page. the source shows only this much loaded:
