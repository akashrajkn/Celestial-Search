What Are Some Good Photo Editing Site?
And What Is Photoshop?

photoshop is a photo editing program.

You should not be looking for photo editing sites but rather a photo editing program for your computer.

also provide some more info on the type of computer or OS your using for example Windows or Mac.
Picnik is a great photoediting website and its frere and easy to use. I'm not sure what photoshp is though.
Hope this helps :D
