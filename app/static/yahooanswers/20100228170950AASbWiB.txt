How do you know when lockerz redemption dates are?
Is there a website that tells you when you can redeem prizes for lockerz also what is the difference between member redemption and general redemption?

Lockerz is a scam, so don't bother with it!
John C is a liar i've gotten HALO2 for my computer from there. General redemptions are once every month and lockerz will tell you when its redemption day but won't tell you the exact time. AS for member redeption you have to pay 100 points to go to one. Its basically so you can increase your chance of winning.
Redemption dates will be announced on your main locker home page. Redemptions will be once a month, for now.

Member Redemption: Pointz have to be paid for a person to be able to participate in the Member Redemption, therefore, less people will be participating. And in turn, you will have a better chance of getting the prize you wish to receive. This is good, since there is a limited stock of items.

General Redemption: Just a general redemption. No participation fee, but you have a lower chance of getting the prize you want. Anyone can redeem a prize during the general redemption.
