Mozilla Firefox Browser Backgrounds?
I was wondering how to get a background in the area where the browser/site navigational area is (Where it says File, Edit, History, etc. and then there's the bar where you search for a site in). I've used it on MY computer, but this is a friend who wants it on theirs too, but I'm not sure how to get it anymore. I don't want a background where the site comes up, just around the navigational/browser bar. 
If possible I would like a link too. (: Thanks in Advance.
NOTE: Okay, so I have the personas addon, but now what? I clicked on the one I wanted to add, but nothing happened. It just opened to a different page with only the picture of the persona and other pictures by it's creator...
