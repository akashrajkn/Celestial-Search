why cant my daughter get google chrome or internet explorer to work on her laptop when internet is workin?


it might just be a bad download so uninstal it and try reloading it.
if she cant get either to work, it could be a connection problem.
check your internet connection.
Download, update, run Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, ccleaner, Reset IE8 to Defaults in Options, Advanced and Restart PC...
Hmm. That is weird maybe try contacting them tat happened to me and my parents did it
