What is the best site to use for an email account for minors?
G-Mail has no provisions for minors, so don't suggest that. Yahoo has more obscene unsolicited junk mail than one could imagine, and their spam filter stinks.
Any suggestions?

Well i think all companys are like that i got hotmail and i go through the same stuff you do your just going to have to deal with it
