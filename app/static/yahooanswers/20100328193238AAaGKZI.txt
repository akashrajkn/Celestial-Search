I Have A Question About Downloading Torrents From Isohunt?
My friend has been downloading torrents from Isohunt for about two weeks now just fine with no problem now until today when he got a message that the torrents are incompatible.  What exactly does that mean?  Thanks.

torrent will be update for particular duration of time........if u take long time to download any content with torrent and in between if torrent is updated that torrent is useless to download, u have download same torrent from same URL freshly. Then the torrent work.

 The torrent may become incompatible when torrent or removed or shifted to new location or URL of torrent is changed etc it has many reasons
