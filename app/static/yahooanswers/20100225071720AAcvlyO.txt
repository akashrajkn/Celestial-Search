is it charged whenver a wibsite is opend by someone?
i am planning to make my own website but some1 told me that if any person will clik or enters into your site then it will be charged for some amount of money.. so is it true that whenever a person views/enters into a website then it is charged for some amount of money or i will gain some amount of money whenevr any1 enters into my website? please help

you will not be charged if someone visits your site instead you have to pay annually to host u r site 
i.e there are annual charges for maintaining site on internet and if u use blogs they are free.

and if u want to earn money through your website design a good website and 

logon to www.google.com/adsense which provides u money by giving ads in u r website
