Internet Explorer problems....?
I am currently running Windows XP on my PC.  A few months ago, I upgraded my Internet Explorer to IE 8.  I had previously been running IE 7 with no problems.  Recently, I have experienced difficulty getting on the internet.  When I click on my Internet Explorer icon, it will begin to download, and then the screen will revert back to my desktop.  Sometimes I have to click on the IE icon 5 different times before the internet will finally appear and be useable.  Other times, the download begins, but then the computer just crashes and I have to restart the computer and try again.  I've downloaded Mozilla Firefox and don't have any trouble with that, but I'm not thrilled with some of Mozilla's features and would rather have IE work properly.  Has anyone had any of these problems with IE 8, and, if so, how did you resolve them?  Did anyone delete IE 8 and then download IE 7 again?  Did this get rid of any problems?  Any help anyone could give me would certainly be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

try google chrome. i like it better than firefox and IE8... if not just downgrade back to ie7 or try reinstalling ie8

All l can say is, get yourself a Mozilla Firefox! lt's amazong.
I have WindowsXP I upgraded to IE 8 and have not had any problems. I also use Firefox. I would never allow Google Chrome  to be on any of my computers.
Try another Browser Especially Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari
Both of them rock!
I agree with Computer Tech!
