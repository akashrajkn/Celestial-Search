MSN virus?!!!!!!!!!!?
my friend sent me something about a photo about me? and there were a link and i stupidly clicked it and then this pop up saying allow or dont allow this thing, and i clicked allow (stupid of me?) and then my msn went all dodgy so i quickly restarted my laptop and then logged onto msn. then another friend of mine is asking me why i sent her a link and i didn't even send her a link. and i asked the person who sent me the link why she sent me that, and she said she didnt send me a link and she said that i sent her that link when i sent no links. now my msn is all dodgy. - i can't open convos with friends, it won't let me, and random contacts of mine pops up and closes really quick? is there any way to get rid of this virus its bugging me.
