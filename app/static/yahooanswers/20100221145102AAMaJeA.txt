Does Rewards1 really work?
And say If i want xbox live will it send me the card or the code itself through email? I don't wanna give out my real address.

rewards 1 is horrible ive been on the site for over 2 years and got nothing, points 2 shop is also horibel too i actually tried to order something and 2 hours later when i checked my account i had negative points and negative cash, so both those experinces were horrible. im on a better site now which is alot easier to get points. all you do are answer daily polls, you get points for logging in, you watch videos and get points for that, and when you invite firends you get points here watch this there will be an even better description. if your interested send me an email with your email address because the site is invite only you need an invite to register

It does but does not make much money. I tried gaming lagoon 7 months ago and ive made 400 dollars just doin some offers. Its easy and approves alot. Just give it a try: http://www.gaminglagoon.com/?ref=212597
