What are good blog ideas?
I want to start a blog, but I don't really know what people would be interested in reading about.
I was thinking about doing a weekly blog on American Idol, but there are quite a few of those out there. 
And I don't really know about doing one about my life because I find that they don't really interest me unless I know them. 
So what kind of blogs are you interested in reading?

Blogs promoting true health. Using foods and natural,come from the earth foods that stop you from getting sick, aids in the fight against, cancers,heart diseases etc.
Well around two years ago I made a blog about who should win american idol and other users vote by commenting. I got around 200 votes then. I never got to finish it because I didn't go on American Idol website in a while but now i'm back on. 
My username of American Idol website is: Sillyfrogster
You can go to myidol.americanidol.com/sillyfrogster to check out my blog post to see how I set them up.
Another idea is to make reviews of contestants performance and who got voted off.
