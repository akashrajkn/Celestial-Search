What is missing in my browser?
I am unable to open websites like 123greetings.com or any other e-cards website. All my browsers (IE 8, Firefox and Google Chrome) couldn't perform the tasks.

java could be the missing thing... or maybe flash player.... or shockwave player just go to java.com and to adobe.com and get the latest versions  of all the things
You need install flash player.
