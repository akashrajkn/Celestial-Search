Which internet provider(s) have the best reviews?
I was thinking Earthlink but I recently saw some negative things about it. I'm taking online college for the first 2 years so I need a service with high speed and decent protection. Windstream's not all that good ( they charge lots more for less), and Cable One did the same thing. Please help

Verizon is arguably the best internet provider, assuming they have fiber optic cables run in your area. Other than that, there's a company called Access4less in my are that provides only internet service (no e-mail or antivirus) for $10 a month and it's great for it's price.
