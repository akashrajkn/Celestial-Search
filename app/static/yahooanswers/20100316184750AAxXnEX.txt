I want to Start Selling on Ebay but i'm a little Confused?
Okay I need some money and was thinking of selling some old video games of mine (not really old but PS3 games i don't play anymore) but i was looking at the sellers fee and i was just going to do a buy it now sale on them but it has two different sellers fees on the info. one is 

Buy It Now price*

Fee

$1.00 - $9.99 = $0.05

$10.00 - $24.99 = $0.10

$25.00 - $49.99 $0.20

$50.00 or more = $0.25
 
and the other is

$0.01 - $50.00 = 15.00% of the closing value that would literally take away $15.00 if i were to sell it for $30.00. if anyone who has sold on ebay for buy it now or video games can you please help me. i feel dumb right now.
my bad. i feel even more stupid. my calculator is adding wrong.

$15.00 is 50% of $30.00 not 15%
15% of $30 is $4.50.
I think you have your symbols confused. $ is the dollars sign and % is the percentage sign.  I'll skip them for the moment. They will take fifteen percent of the selling price (which means 15 cents off every dollar.)  Fifteen percent of thirty dollars is four dollars and fifty cents.  Your fee would be twenty cents for the listing and four dollars and fifty cents once you sell it, for a total of four dollars and seventy cents.  You would get to keep twenty-five dollars and thirty cents.
don't even bother with the crap like ebay and amazon, they will charge you so much fees you will be left with nothing at the end. On top of that it will take shet load of time to list all the products and even longer to sell for a decent price. People won't bid a lot if you don't have like thousands of positive feedbacks.
You better off going to http://sellgamesfast.com and submit them a quote with what you have. They will give you a lot more then ebay and send you cash in 2-3 days. 
I used to torture myself with ebay, until I found sellgamesfast, now all my used games and gadgets go there, so I can buy more :)
