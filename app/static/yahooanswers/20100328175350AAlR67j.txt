phonezoo question..... help?
ive always used phonezoo for ringtones and wall papers.. never had problems before. but now once i send the link to my phone,it gets to my phone with no problem its just when i go to open the link my phone says forbidden. i have internet on my phone and everything. so i dont get it. i checked to make sure everything was updated on the account. and eveything is fine. any ideas? please help. or if you know of a better website, that would be great to. thanx :)

If it says forbidden, that is from your carrier.  Who is your carrier.  You should probably contact Phonezoo directly so they can help you.
make it yourself!


i use the Ventones site. just upload and make any ringtone for FREE


http://www.ventones.com

THIS IS THE BEST SITE WITHOUT A DOUBT

step 1 upload a music file
step 2 select what part of the file you want as a ringtone
step 3 they text it straight inside a text message
