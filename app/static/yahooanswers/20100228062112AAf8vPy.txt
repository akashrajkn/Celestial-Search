I don't know why one site would be different than others, but you can always change it by pressing Ctrl and either the down arrow or scrolling down on the mouse wheel.

Or you can reset it in your browser by clicking on View and choosing 100%.
You can hold down CTRL and roll the mouse wheel up and down to make your text any size you desire. Also you can hit F11 to go full page.
