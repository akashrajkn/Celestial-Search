Hi,
so this has been happening for the last 6 months ??

please check this :-
your systems firewall settings
your admin rights (you are an admin on your system)
your routers firewall settings

what else !!!!

also scan your system with malwarebytes for mailware
http://malwarebytes.org/

install firefox and use that to download (look in the update box if it blocks the download)
are you on an Internal internet system which you have limited rights (works system)

hope this all helps you if you

update :-
use a friends system to download firefox (use filehippo site) onto a USB flash drive then install it from the flash drive back onto your system
now when you download a file etc
look at the bottom left corner status bar
and find out WHY you are blocked

hope this helps again
