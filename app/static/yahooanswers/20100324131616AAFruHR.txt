How do you remove bookmarks you have made on Pandora (internet radio)?
Can you?  If so, how do you do that?

Thank you for your help! :)

To Remove Bookmarks  you have to do the following

1. Login to your Pandora Account On Your PC
2. Click on " Your Profile "
3. Stroll to the bottom where it says Bookmarked Songs
4. On The Right Hand Side Their is a Button that says "Edit" Click On It
5. And click remove songs
6. From Their check the songs that you want to remove and click remove checked

That's how you remove bookmark songs from Pandora and for artist is just the same process hope this helped
