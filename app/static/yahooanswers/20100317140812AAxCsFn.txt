I'm designing a weebly website for girls and women .. any tips?
I'm designing a weebly website for girls and women .. I've never created or designed a website or a blog before but I've this idea of a website for women and girls with articles about every thing that interest us like style, home, make up, etiquette .... etc with videos and photos .. and I thought I can create a weebly website for this cause it's easy to design and doesn't need experience ..

so any suggestions, opinions , tips , thoughts .. is it a good idea?

I and my friends already have a facebook group for girls only .. we post a lot of articles that we write by ourselves .. we have like 800 female member (I don't know if 800 is a big number or not but for me it's ok since we are a closed group and we don't accept any request ) so It will not be just copy and paste .. I'm just asking because blogs and websites are very different from facebook groups

if you fail my doctor wants to talk to you
Seems like much of your content - the videos, photos, and possibly even the text - will simply be content copied from other sites.  If this is the case, this would be regarded as theft, simply because the content is not your own personally created content.
I only make this assumption due to your admission that you have never previously created a website
