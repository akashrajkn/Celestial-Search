The point of followers is so that whoever is following you sees your tweets on their homepage.
people tend to think that everything they do is important, i dont see how, i dont see why people actually care, i myself only have a myspace, and i dont think ill ever get a twitter,
If someone is 'following' you, they get updates when you post something, as opposed to them going around searching for a post.
its fun!(=
If you have information that you want to share about a subject matter, niche or product or service, than you need an audience; on Twitter they are called followers.

The key to getting followers in Twitter is by following others.  However, you probably don't want to follow just anybody.  You want to follow people who are interested in the things that you are interested in.  So make a list of 7 keywords of things that you are interested in and then watch this video about how to sign-up for a free Twitter application that will allow you to follow people using your keywords.  Due to the fact that you are following people that share an interest, there is a high probability that they will follow you back.
