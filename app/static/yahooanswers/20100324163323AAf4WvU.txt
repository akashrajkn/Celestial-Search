What makes a reliable web source reliable?
like characteristics you'd look for when researching.

I assume this would be for a school paper

It not being from Wikiepedia.

An actual company, or newspaper, the federal government.  State Government, the National Archives, the Library of Congress I could go on.  but basically something that would be credible and not something like Joeswebpageofinformation.com
