How do I put adds on to my internet explorer 8?
The reason I ask this is because youtube(the idiots) have said that I need to update my Internet explorer(which I did), because of this I cannot view videos on Youtube, Metcafe and even other websites! I have even downloaded Flash player!

My internet explorer keeps saying that I have disable my Adds on! However, when I checked this by going to 'tools' and then clicking on 'Manage adds on' it's show's that everything is ENABLED!

Can someone please help me!

Check again. If its enabled, maybe you should re download everything
Check it again. On the Manage Add-ons page that shows enabled add-ons, click one & then click the More Info link at the bottom of the page. It will open a window showing any blocked sites. Remove any you don't want blocked
