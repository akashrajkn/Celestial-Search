How do I unsign an online petition?
Ok so a few years back I signed a petition on Care2.com and now I can not seem to get my signature removed, does anyone have any idea how I could do this??  It's quite aggravating.

I've tried contacting customer service with a nice tone and everything.. they don't respond to e-mails their answering machine tells you that they won't respond to messages you leave.  Any suggestions on how to hide it from Google so it doesn't appear as the first thing under my name upon searching?

Thank you!!

You can't really. Under the terms and conditions of Care2.com (if you read them) it clearly states that when you sign a petition you are entering into a contract which states that you're bound by your signature. Basically, you can't remove it.
you don't sign an online petition so it has no legal significance and few people will take it seriously , it is unlikely to appear on google unless they pay google to have it high in their search results
