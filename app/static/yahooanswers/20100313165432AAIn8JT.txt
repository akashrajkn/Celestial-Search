What is bertter, Chrome or Firefox OR  what else?
im usin windows vista and i jus wanna know which one is better! is chrome the best? is firefox the best? or is there some other one i havent heard of that exceeds my expectations?

it depends what you are looking for, in my opinion chrome is the best browser however firefox has an extensive library of addons. Chrome is faster at opening up and loading pages, even if only marginally.
give up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer without opening any windows something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible
I'd always rather use Firefox. It works much faster than other browsers. Also, it has a huge addon collection that give you the ability to do almost everything that you need in your internet browsing. Non of the other browsers have these supreme capabilities.
