Nope. You need to get it from another Spotify member.

I have one left y'know ;) - If you want me to send you it, please email me on Yahoo. (if u go on my answers profile, u can mail me).

EDIT: I'll need an email address to send it to you on (if you want me 2).
I can't tell you if there is one but i can tell you that I registred with them and 6 wks later an invite came through. I know its not much help but at least you know that you may get one before summer.
ooh unlucky; until 18th jan they had a "backdoor" thing  that I used to get an account without an invite. erm, i dont know how to give an nvite.... i think you have to have a paying account to send . i dunno
