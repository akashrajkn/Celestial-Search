have any of you heard of tiger direct?
I found an item that I wanted to buy and the ad website I found it on said it was from tiger direct. I keep typing in www.tigerdirect.com and It won't work. It just takes along time and then tells me the link is broken. I know it is a fairly popular site, am I the only one having trouble accessing it or what?

No problems here. Loads right up.
it doesn't work for me as well.....
doesn't seem to work here.
Tiger Direct may be having a server problem, but it loaded for me.  You could also try the following:  

http://www.zipzoomfly.com  

http://www.newegg.com  

Both of these sites are very secure and have a great selection of computer products.
