Mibba help! Please!!?
OK, Im a mibba user and I have some pretty good stories on there, but, my profile is not very...good. I am also having problems in my stories. 

First of all, does anyone know any good websites where I could find good layouts for my mibba profile? And show me how to get them onto my mibba profile, also maybe some cool affects I could use on my mibba profile if there are any.

Second, how do I get a picture on my mibba profile, not in the about me part, but the part above all my information, like age name, etc. 

Last, when Im reading stories I notice some people have click able worlds, like links. I can't figure out how they do that.. 

Help? D:

http://www.mibba.com/forums/bbcode/     <---- That tells you the way to do links. How to put picks and such. The one your specifically talking of is this one : [url=Address]Link Name[/url].   I personally find these both irritating and useful. Irritating because the main thing of writing is your freedom to believe in your own way of how the character, things they wear look. But putting links to clothes and such ind of ruins that prospect. But thats my own belief.

Look around, and you come across plenty of stuff to answer your questions. 

http://layouts.mibba.com/Profiles/   <---Layouts. You can also request ones Here, or look for people who make them in the forums:

For the picture, you go to your mibba home and click on the photo link in the profile section.

Click browse, select the pic you want, and voila. But that did kind of evade me for a while. Its rather picky on picks sometimes.

And, if you want to know how to make your own story layout, you:

go to story section. Click layouts. click create new layout, and tweak around with it on page editor. Youll get better at it over time. 

You can  use photobucket links for that too. 


:) hope i helped.
