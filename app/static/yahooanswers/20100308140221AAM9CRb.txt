You know when you win a Swagbucks Swagstakes when your name is put in the status of one of the Swagstakes you entered through this link: http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sw-account. I think the best swagstakes would be the limited entries one especially because you can only enter once and there's a little bit amount of people entering them.

Your welcome! :)

Goodluck winning!
