I am thinking about making a website?
I am thinking about making a website where users can go to and post and review jobs like if someone wanted to work at company a and they went to the site and found company a they could read reviews that employees there have written and decided if it was a good place to work. do you think this is a good idea and could be lucrative?

It would be very time consuming to maintain a web site like this, even though there are many job sites on the internet, it would probably require you to find something special to offer that would attract people to the web site. You would also need to know what kind of legal issues you would run into. One that might take off and be successful, would be one based on Barter Services instead. People are always looking for ways to get things they can't afford, like products or other services in exchange for what they have or can do from their experience. I have noticed the the Nursing Industry has gone to Bidding for jobs on line. Time have changed.

I wish you the Best in your Adventure and Success.
