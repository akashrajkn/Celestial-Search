Can you use Blackberry phones on your home internet connection?
I am thinking of buying a blackberry smartphone but!! I do not want to pay the crazily high costs for 3g or other moblie web browsing.  So can could I connect 1 to my schools wireless network or the one at home???

Yes if you make sure the one you buy has wifi

all new blackberrys have wifi although...... i have had two different blackberrys with two different companies (Verizon, t mobile) and both required the blackberry to have internet no matter what. i could use the phone without buying the internet package so keep that in mind.
Yes if it has wifi you will be able to connect unless your school has a secure system. You can connect in any hotspot area or to an unsecured internet system. It`s called `piggybacking`.
