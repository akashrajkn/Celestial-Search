whats a proxy that always works?
I work at a high school and my for me to get online I have to be their internet system and its a pain not to be able to check my e-mail, any good proxys to unblock yahoo, facebook, or myspace?

Download and install Hotspot Shield: [http://download.cnet.com/hotspot-shield/, http://hotspotshield.com/], JonDo (with JonDoFox): [http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondo/download/].

These software will mask your IP and assist you in bypassing any server frameworks. Hope this helps.
Here are some great proxies that work at my school:

http://www.guardtunnel.com
http://www.unblockbook.biz
http://www.unblockfacebook.biz

All three have SSL and are very fast and compatible with MySpace/Facebook.

If they don't work, then here's a constantly updating list of proxies:

All proxies are created equal using the exact same technology. None is better than any other and the web filters know how to detect them now. So they don¡¯t' work anymore.
Here is a list of fresh fast proxy list I have just find today:
