Why do people answer others with @ before their name?
@chris1emt -- is this a result of the popularity of Twitter?  I've noticed this in the past several weeks but it has NEVER been popular before, I've never even seen it before in any message board or forum anywhere.

Yeah, some people use it to reference a person or their username on just about any online message board, forum, even facebook. I think the '@' character highlights that a person is referencing someone. And it's also due to the popularity of Twitter, like what you mentioned.
Doing that is a sign that a person isn't very bright. Some might say it's only done by stupid people.
