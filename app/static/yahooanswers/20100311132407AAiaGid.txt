This is very important and has to do with music.?
Does anyone know a website where I can download music straight to my computer with out it costing anything? I have tried different places but I can't find it. I have to burn a cd for school.

Possibly using "torrents"
or phazemp3*cough*.com
try http://www.mp3obsession.com/
what kind of music do you need
if you need rnb or hip hop i know some sites
these sites are free and require no registration and the site uploads songs daily
www.rnbuncovered.com
www.im1music.net
www.rockdizmusic.com
www.urbanascor.com
www.rnbxclusive.com
www.urbanmusicdaily.net
http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/

Yes! With http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ you search more than 80 free, safe, legal music sites (for whole albums, add the word "rapidshare"). That way you can forget about viruses.

Hope this helps. Regards!
