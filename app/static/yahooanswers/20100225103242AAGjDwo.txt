What is the difference between Internet Explorer and Firefox? Also, which is better?
If I switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox will I still get Google and Yahoo search engines and  outlook express E-Mail?

Firefox is my favorite browser. Yes you can still use Yahoo and Google, in fact you can have a Yahoo and or Google toolbar on Firefox.

It will work with any web based email and I beleive it is compatible with outlook.

It's a free download so you can try it to see if you like it.

Outlook express should be installed on your computer so your browser doesn't matter.
But if you're looking to move from IE then go to Chrome, not to failurefox. Firefox is a slow browser. Even IE8 is faster.
