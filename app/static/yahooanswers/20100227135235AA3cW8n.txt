whats better firefox or safari?
and which is faster?

chrome is better than both!
Neither. Google Chrome is faster than both of them.
I've used both internet browsers, but on my opinion and public opinion, I would use Firefox. It is faster on most computers.
firefox. google chrome may even be faster than both. But if you have windows 7, for some reason IE works the BEST in speed
I would choose safari out of the two, because it is faster. I like SRWare Iron better though...
