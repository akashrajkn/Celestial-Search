Can anyone find me GIMP 2.6.2 proper download link?
I go on http://www.gimp.org/downloads/ and it's not there.
I don't want to google it and download any random GIMP cause it could be a virus.
Thanks !!

This is latest version.. has a bug fix in it. better than the 2.6.2  ~
try 1st one it is all good.. I got it from here only..
scroll down and u can download it..

but if u are ok wit 2.6.8 then it is ok.. because it is the most trusted place i refer to.. i.e. cnet.com [see the second link..
