If Steve Irwin had a dinosaur...?
Would it be red, black, or white?

I have a hunter called Crikey on WoW, need a new pet :P
Rudy - NEXT TIME YOU TRY AND CONFUSE PEOPLE WITH YOUR RETARD WALLS OF TEXT ALL IN CAPITALS, GROW UP!
Fatal Existence - Cant have green, otherwise I would :(

Red, black and white are only options...
John W - I'm getting a stingray later...
