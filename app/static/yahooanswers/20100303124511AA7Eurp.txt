Unfortunately there isn't, watching videos online buffers a lot which will take a lot of your speed
Either A, your internet connection sucks horribly, or B you are not letting the video load. Just let it sit for a few minutes to load, but if that doesn't work, it's your internet and you can't do anything about that. Computer has nothing to do with it.
go to youtube and upload the show. Pause it while you wait for it to load.. then you will be able to watch the whole show once you've uploaded it.. However, you might want to open three or four tabs cuz one show will be more than one video, so open a window, go to youtube.com, type the video you want. Then open a new tab (Ctrl+T) and start the next video going. Don't forget to pause them so they load fster.. then once the first video is complete, you can easily move to the next tab and continue without a problem
I use free Download Helper add-on for Firefox to download videos from websites enabling you to save them on your computer and watch them later without buffering. http://www.downloadhelper.net/
