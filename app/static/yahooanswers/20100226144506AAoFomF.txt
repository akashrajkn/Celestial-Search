Whenever i try to sign onto AIM it says "you've entered an invalid screen name or password??"?
even though it is the RIGHT screen name and RIGHT password? I tried on all my screen names, my roommate tried his, mom tried hers, tried my boyfriend's, tried my best friend's , none is working (i have their passwords) but i tried all on my computer. tried on aim, aimexpress, and meebo. all the same. its odd. what could be causing this? we all couldn't be hacked, we don't ALL know the same peeople....

it's doing this to me too, i thought my screenname had a virus for a second haha, it's probably just some aol glitch, i hope it gets fixed soon!
It's doing the same to me. Give it some time. I'm sure it will be fixed.
xo
its happening to me too.
all my passwords are saved also, so i thought i got a virus but i guess this is happening to most of us :[

although i tried my boyfriend's screenname and it works perfectly fine :/
Ya I'm having the same problem as well. Was working fine 1 hour ago. But I can't connect using any screenname using aim, meebo etc.
same problem i was able to get online earlier i guess its a glitch.
i think something is going on with services, because the same thing is happening to me. i tried on the computer and thought maybe the keyboard was messing up again, so i tried on my phone and instead of the invalid info, it said services currently down. 

we just need to be patient and wait for AIM to go back up.
it happened to all 25 of my screen names, 1 hour it was just fine so i guess give it another hour.... if not wait till tomorrow
It's working again.
