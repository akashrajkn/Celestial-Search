What should I name my character on pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver?
I have NO idea what to name my character on pokemon heartgold/soulsilver and I need your help to find me a name. I am really into japanese names so if you know any that would be good. I pick the boy character on the game. Also do you have a rival person in the game and do you name her?

Thanks.

Try Ethan that's what the guy's name is anyway.
If your into japenese names, you might want to pick soru, or gorudo, or shirubia. Yes you do have a rival and he is a boy.  You also have a friend pre-named lyra who is a girl.
Japanese boy names like Daisuke,Kaage,Mitsu are good names.Girl names Tahira,Ren,and Masago are good to in opinion.
