I use yahoo as my homepage, I don't like internet explorer, but sometimes when I'm on yahoo internet explorer?
sends pop-ups and they still come through even though I have pop-up blocker enabled. Then when it comes on the screen, it won't let me close it. Does anyone else have this problem? Is there anything I can do about it? Please make it simple, not very knowledgeable on computers. Thank you
