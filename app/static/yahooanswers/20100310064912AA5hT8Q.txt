www.flycell.com fraud.. did not have permission to charge my account?
So out of the blue the other day i get a text saying my subscription has been renewed for $9.99 a month. WTF. never heard of this site before.  I find out its a site to download games, ringtones, wallpapers and such. I dont use any of that- ever. 

Anyway im in a battle with them now to refund me my $$ yes so what i want my $10 back. They are all Indian and will not take my call, told me the only way to talk to the admin is to email the boss.. 

Has anyone else had an issue with them and what can i do about it? I've already put a block on them from my provider.
Can i still do that if it doesnt come thru in my bank? it was charged to my cell phone bill.

Contact your bank and dispute the charge. The vendor will then have to submit proof that you ordered the service.
