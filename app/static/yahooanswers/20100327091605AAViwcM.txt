How long does it take you to turn on your computer then go to your internet home page?
i took 1min 37secs.

I've not timed it, but seeing as I have Windows 7 and Google Chrome I think it takes around 40 seconds.

I can't wait for Google Chrome OS to come out, when from the time you press the power button to when you get on the web takes around 5 seconds.
with my windows 7 & firefox approx 30 seconds :-)
