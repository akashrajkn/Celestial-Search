is there a way to go into fire fox spell check and update it or remove words that you told the system that is right but isn't

Your personal dictionary, persdict.dat, seems to be in this directory

In Windows XP:

C:\Documents and Settings\your username\Application Data\Mozilla\ Firefox\Profiles\your profile

In Windows Vista:

C:\Users\your username\Appdata\Roaming\Mozilla\ Firefox\Profiles\ your profile

(Note: If the directory Appdata doesn¡¯t appear in Windows Explorer, enter the full path name in Explorer¡¯s address window.)

The file seems to be editable with Wordpad.

Hope that helps.
