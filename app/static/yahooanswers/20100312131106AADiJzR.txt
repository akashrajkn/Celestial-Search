Is there a way to watch the Ghana Music Awards Festival from the USA?
Hey, I live in the USA but I am obsessed with Hiplife music in Ghana.  :)  I REALLY want to watch the Ghana Music Awards Festival on April 10, 2010 to see if my favorite performers win any (hopefully ALL) the five awards they've been nominated for.  Is there ANY way to watch Ghana TV so I can see the show too???  THANKS.

In order to receive Ghana TV, it must be transmitted on the other end...... I doubt they have an up link to a satellite. The other solution would be to stream it off the internet.  TV-online-channels.com would be one of many solutions, www.yourglobaltv.com ? is another one
hope this  helps
