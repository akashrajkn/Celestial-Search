does any one know any good free music sites? and not like lime wire i mean like mp3raid.com i just need sites like that i donot care if they are legal or not

Tigow.com  is amazing. You can listen to the songs before you download it :)
You don't care if they're legal or not? Do the people you're putting out of work care? Does your mother know you're a thief???

Are you aware that the RIAA actually looks for thieves, and sometimes takes them to court and it could cost YOU between $250 and $1,500 PER SONG if it's you they come after?
