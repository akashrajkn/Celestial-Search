Deleting entries in drop-down box of address bar on mozilla firefox?
two questions:

1. is there a way to delete entries in this drop down box?
2. when using private browsing, will the sites visited appear in the drop-down box?

thanks

1. Hover over them and press delete.
2. No, that's the point of it.
You can disable the drop down on firefox simply by:

? typing into the address bar about:config
? Click on the button saying i'll be careful i promise
? in the filter box type in browser.urlbar.maxRichResults
? double click where it says 12 opposite and change the value to -1
? Restart firefox and the drop down is disabled. 

hope this helps
