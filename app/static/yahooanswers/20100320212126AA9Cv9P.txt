How do I enable my webcam for Chatroulette?
Everything seems to be working on it and I can webcam over msn but when I click "New Game" on chat roulette it says my cam needs to be enabled. How do I do that?

If it works everywhere else, then it is not compatible with flash. 

You can use virtual webcam software. It allows to put a video or an image instead of your real web-cam
