Yahoo mail vs Gmail vs Hotmail..Which one do you prefer?
I believe most of us have those three email accounts at the same time. They all provide excellent services,  but  which one do you like best?

Gmail
Gmail is my favorite, but I use hotmail because it's easier to block spam
yahoo mail

Yahoo! Mail

Did Gmail for a while; came back to Yahoo.

Gmail interface has become sluggish, requiring many F5 refreshes.

Yahoo mail interface is snappier and I am old fashioned because I prefer to keep my mail organized in an hierarchical structure vs. tags.

I don¡¯t really like the threaded conversation views in Gmail.

I like the new Yahoo Calendar beta much better than Google calendar; it offers a little more flexibility, and synchronizes very well with iCal. Yahoo contacts also synchronize very well with Address Book on my Mac.

I forward my Gmail to my Yahoo.
Hotmail. It's quick, easy, simple, and your service provider can't confiscate your email if you cancel your service. Like At&t (Yahoo Mail) and Comcast did when I switched companies. The only reason I still have this Yahoo account is because I didn't give them this info when I bought their service, but At&t deleted my other Yahoo account.
gmail is better
