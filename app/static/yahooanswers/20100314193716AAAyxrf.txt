safari and google chrome wont pick up my internet connection, but AIM messenger and internet explorer will?
whats going on? i just installed McAfee Virus Protection. Could that have anything to do with it.
what does that mean

just make sure that they are not working off line from file tab
McAfee is probably blocking it. I don't have the program so I can't tell you how to unblock it.
