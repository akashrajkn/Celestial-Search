I want to get onto to the free version of Spotify but it keeps asking for an invite token. Can anyone help?
People have said that you can just register for Free Spotify without an invite but I have tried this and it seems to have blocked this option. Any ideas, I would be very grateful. Thanks :)

Hi
Spotify doesn't work in my country...
Have found http://www.tv243.com a great alternative for Music
