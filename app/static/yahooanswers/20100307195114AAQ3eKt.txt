Does anyone know how ebay works?
hey guys sorry im a little daft when it comes to computer stuff. :) we're getting a puppy in a few months and its my job to figure out selling stuff on ebay because my mom wants to sell stuff on there instead of having a yard sale. so... if anyone can give me any tips on selling on ebay and just a general run down of how it works it would be helpful.

You pay a small fee to list an item and put on a picture (first one free), and a fee if the item sells.

The people can send you a money order or pay with paypal, and you mail it off!

good luck!
you create an account and sell stuff. ppl have a feedback rating so dont sell to ppl that get too low. sell ONLY after you recived payment. if u have paypal that works pretty well on ebay. post pictures of the items and list what is wrong witht them too, or else u will get a bad feeedback rating. remember this: its cost around .50 to $1 to list an items, so make sure it is worthwile
Make an account, pick an item to put up, take some pictures, name your price, wait. When someone chooses it, take it to the post office and send it to their address.

Try to be as helpful and as detailed as possible in your descriptions of the item. People are more likely to buy from your store if you tell them everything they need to know. How big is it? Is it still in good condition? What can it be used for? How well does it work? The bare minimum is to tell them everything they would know if they tried it out at the store, but think, *you* don't want it, why should they? 

You want your buyer to want it.
