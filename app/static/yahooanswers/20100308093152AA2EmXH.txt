If you have unlimited space on a website, what would you host?


ALL THE GOOD NOVELS OF THE EARTH AND ALL THE MYTHOLOGIES OF THE EARTH AND THEIR TRANSLATIONS INTO ALL THE LANGUAGES OF THE EARTH. ALSO ALL THE GOOD(MEANING VERY VERY ETHICAL) RADIO PROGRAMMES,TV PROGRAMMES AND HIGHLY ARTISTIC(AGAIN VERY VERY ETHICAL) FILMS OF THE EARTH. THEN A LIVE SIMULTANEOUS RECORDING AND BROADCASTING OF INTERESTING CHILDREN'S TALK(HERE NO CONDITIONS ABOUT BEING VERY VERY ETHICAL) .THIS LAST THING WILL EASILY FILL ALL NOOKS AND CORNERS OF REMAINING SPACE
I would have hosted a lot if the legal part wasn't a problem, so sticking with that idea, I would make a site where people could store all their freeware/open-source software/ movies / pictures. Personally I would share the space with the world there is so little I can put in there and there are so many people looking for a place to store their information. It would also be troublesome for me to put large files because if I need them then it will take a lot of time to download.
