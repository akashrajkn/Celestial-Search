Needing some help finding guest posters?or just someone to talk to.?
Hi there I have recently made my own blog called What I Do Online.Its about what I do online and I'm currently looking for someone to help me out on my blog by placing guest posts or just someone that has there own blog I can talk to about blogging.So I have someone to talk to about post ideas or to talk to about the blog.I would prefer someone I could talk to that would not mind guest posting once in a while or just to help with giving me tips or just someone to talk to about blogging.Or if you could give me a link to forums or a group that enjoy talking about blogs or blogging that would be great to...

You can actually look into http://acommunityforbloggers.com/ it's basically a community of bloggers like you so I guess posting a request there should get you some responses.
