What is the Best web hosting that has both php and html?
Ok, here is the deal.
My current web-hosting service is 1and1, i have a website for my friend and that needs to be html but i would like my website to have php. I need to find a different service that provides both at the same time... any ideas?

PS: Front page extensions would be nice but not extremely important.

Love these folks!

Honestly, the best service you will ever get.
A Little more pricey, but I had no down time
and the customer service is top -for my money,
it's worth every penny.

I was positive PHP came loaded. Ask first, though.
