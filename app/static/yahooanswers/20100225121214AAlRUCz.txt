What are some benefits of pirating music and movies?
Im writing a research paper. I want to do it on how the American copyright laws are unjust and should be removed. I can't come up with any ideas, so answers, if you have any reasons why those copyright laws and DRMs (Digital rights management) need to be removed. If you have any sources I'll take any and all help

you get free room and board when you get caught
You can't come up with any reasons because there aren't any good ones. Why would people create music and movies and put all the time, money, and effort into it if they're not going to profit off of it? If I go to work, I'm going to get paid for it. Actors, musicians, writers, directors, producers, etc all would like to get paid for their work. Go figure. They don't want random people stealing it and profiting on their work. 

I think you might want to try a different angle on your paper.
they are free
There is only one, and that is its free for the illegal downloader...
You get a nice kush little jail cell that you can share with your new "intimate friend".
