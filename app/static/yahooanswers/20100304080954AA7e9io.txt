how can I make a good thumbnail picture for twitter?
I've seen people with good quality photos as their default and mine always comes out all blurry :/ is there anything I can use to make a good looking thumbnail instead of letting twitter shrink my photos automaticaly?

XnView is a utility for viewing and converting graphic files.

You can find a link to download it here:

Once you have downloaded it, open up the file, then from the menu select Image|resize.

Once you have it at the right size, do File|Save as

Its all straightforward from there.
