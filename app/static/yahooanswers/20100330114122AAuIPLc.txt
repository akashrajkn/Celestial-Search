What is a music website that will not be blocked at schools?


What you need to do is go to a proxy site. A proxy site will allow you to enter any URL through another server and get to any website you wish. I suggest going to Google and searching "proxy sites"
aol.com try a proxy ino most schools block proxys 2 but you can google at school and keep trying or type in your radio station and press listen live thats wat i do
School computers are for school work only! Listening to music is not school work!
www.grooveshark.com isn't blocked at my school,

- those of you who are saying school is for learning, some lessons enable you to listen to music. i.e when you're revising or doing independent work.
Set your browser to use proxy.cjb.net port 1080 as the SOCKS proxy. Leave the others blank.

Here are the instructions: http://www.cjb.net/proxy.html
This isn't the answer you are looking for, but when you are at school, it is time to work. Listening to music is probably not permitted.
