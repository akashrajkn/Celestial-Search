Facepunch forum ban correct?
Banned by the Super Moderator because I said "I pirated GMod 10 once to try before I buy, I bought a copy later because of it." 

I get a 2 day ban and he says we don't tolerate that crap and buying it later doesn't count.

Well if he expects me to pay for a really chopped up limited copy of the game then he can go suck one.

Isn't this a little abuse? Currently trying to find a higher up and inform him of this.
Yeah y'all are right. I mean it was kind of rude but he has to let others know pirating will not be tolerated and that I should be lucky he didn't let the team know and fine me the $250,000.00 piracy fine. Guess I got off easy. Better apologize when the ban is worn off.

The issue is you technically broke the law and you made it public knowledge, as much as I think he was just being a dick I think he was just making an example of you to let the message be known
Mods like to abuse their powers in banning, trust me, I know.

Don't let it get to ya, Mr. Super Moderator will get his one day.

Good luck to yas!
