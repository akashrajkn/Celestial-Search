Question about 'Second Life' the game. First of all I am a newbie on SL. Recently I brought a space ship to-?
use as a permanent home on SL.But always after a period of time ( between minutes to a couple of hours)my space ship disappear and go back to my 'lost and find' folder. My question is does anyone know a SIM where my 'rez' object will remain there for ever or at least a long time? Thanks for any answer.

It sounds like you're trying to rez the home on land that you don't own.   Every piece of land in SL is owned by someone and each one has a certain prim count allotment.    Owners are careful about their prim counts and it's considered extremely rude to rez something on land that you don't own unless there is a prior agreement with the owner.   Ultimately the land owner has full control over what's on his land and if he doesn't own it, he'll likely return it.

There are public sandboxes that allow you to rez items or build stuff, but only temporarily. You're expected to de-rez all your stuff when you leave.

If you want a permanent house to live in, then you'll need to own or rent land.  I'd recommend renting.
