On PrizeRebel.com...?
Should I put my actual zip code in? I'm making an account.

Yes. It is safe. Using false info will get your account deleted.
yeah that'll be fine. And also if you want to help someone out try signing up with there referral link. Mine is below. And dont worry signing up with the referral link is exactly the same as signing up regularly it just help the other person get more points.
When completing offers, make sure your zip code, phone number, and address are fake but match your location. Other than that, you can use fake info. Good luck! It's possible to earn 50+ points a month once you get up to speed.

[EDIT]: I forgot to mention - use the same fake information every time, but create a new (not temporary) email every few offers. Probably the reason for the down-vote lol.
