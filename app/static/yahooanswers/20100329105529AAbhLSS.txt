Can I save my firefox configurations and addons?
What I mean when I reformat my PC can I save my firefox addons so will not have to go and find and reinstall all the addons again.

I don't think so , you can save your bookmarks ofcourse , but not addons. .

there is a software ,btw , that will save all your winows configurations and programs once you format and reinstall windows and use it .. but I don't remember it's name ,,, google it
Hi!

Do a search for Moz Backup. I use it all the time, it will make a back up of all your setting, bookmarks, passwords, etc. I believe it also gets your addons, but I'm not 100% sure. I've used it numerous times and I don't remember having to go out and reinstall all my addons. It's a great program and has saved me tons of time when switching to a new computer. Just create a back up of Firefox, then install Firefox on the new computer and run Moz Backup and choose the restore option, it also does the same thing for Thunderbird. Great software!

Hope this helps
Good Luck!
