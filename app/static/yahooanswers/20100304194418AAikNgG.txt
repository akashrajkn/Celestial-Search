site like meetup.com?
Anyone know any site that allows you create or join groups of people with similar interests? I cannot find anything on meetup in my area and I cannot afford to pay $20 a month to start one.  Please do not say Craigslist (nothing there).  Meetin.org has nothing either.

This is an online classifieds site that I use. It is similar to Craigslist AND it's FREE!
