I paid with PayPal but my order is still processing?
I've used PayPal before and I have my check card linked so the payments are instant...to avoid the 3-5 day pending/processing time. In the past (on Ebay and other sites, even out of the United States online) the payment has gone through instantly with no problems. Tonight I placed an order on a UK site and paid with PayPal but the payment hasn't gone through. On my PayPal page it says the transaction is complete but on the UK site my order status says "PayPal processing...". I paid almost 4 hours ago. 

What does this mean and why hasn't the money gone through yet? And is there anything I should do? Thanks in advance. **10 POINTS FOR THE MOST HELPFUL ANSWER**

It can take some time.  As long as the Paypal says it has processed, you're good.
I have experienced this with UK sites before.
Some sites can take up to 2 days to process an order. 
This may be because an employee has to actually check the Paypal payment has gone through, which could take time if it's the middle of the night there or they have a lot of orders to process.
Give it a few days, and if there is still no change, contact the site about your order. Remember to include evidence of your order.
