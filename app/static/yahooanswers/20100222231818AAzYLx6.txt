I need a new browser that has very simple/easily workable bookmarks; are there any?
I was using Flock, but when I upgraded, I was horrified to discover that I simply cannot even use their new bookmark system. I already tried Firefox, and it's very similar to Flock.

Google Chrome is a web browser that runs web pages and applications with lightning speed

Quick to start up from your desktop
Loads web pages in a snap
Runs web applications faster than ever
I use google chrome. They give you an option to put them on your top bar which you can easily colapse and restore, or a list you can open from a button on the top right.

I ONLY use chrome now. I love it.

Its also way faster than the rest!
Google Chrome perhaps?
