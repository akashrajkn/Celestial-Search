On Twitter, will people see my @replies?
If I @reply someone, it doesn't show up if I go and search @thatperson to see all their @replies. Will they still see my reply anyways even though it doesn't show up on the timeline when I search it? It should still be under their @replies, right?
okay, here's what i mean. for example, i sent a reply to Jeffrey Sparkman. So I sent @jeffreysparkman blahblahblahblah. I searched @jeffreysparkman to see all the people that replied to him, and it's only been a few in the past few hours, but my reply did not show up when i searched it. will he still see my reply to him?

When you reply to someone with an @, people can see it by viewing your page. It will not show in their feed. Other people will NOT see your replies to other people on THEIR pages, however.
well if you put @(person) it will be in your twiiter cause you twittered it not them.
an @reply can be seen by anyone who follows the person your @replying 

or if anyone was to view your twitter feed.
