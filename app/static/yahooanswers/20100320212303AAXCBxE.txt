How long has the Internet been available to the general public?
What was it like when it first started? Has it changed much over the years? The Internet is a fantastic invention, soooo clever!

I think the late 80's, but really didn't catch on until mid 90's.
Something like 1970.  But it didn't get popular until 1994.  But it first was invented about 1958.
EXACTLY SINCE FEBRUARY 3 1992
In 1985 I connected the school I worked in to a school in Milan. It wasn't easy as there was no link from Scotland to Italy but luckily I had a friend at Trinity College in Dublin who could route pupils questions to Italy and send answers back to us. It was very slow but it worked on our BBC computers and a grindingly slow modem.
