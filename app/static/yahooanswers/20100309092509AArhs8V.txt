Is Lockerz for real? Does Lockerz.com call you on your first redeem?
I am an international user and I had to enter my phone number on my Lockerz.com account creation. Now... I didn't really entered my valid phone number.... do they have to call you in order to get your prize?

Thanks

its 100% legit. hard to believe i know but youtube lockerz and watch the hundreds of videos of people opening prizes. and no they dont call you EVER
