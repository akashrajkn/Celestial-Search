fan fiction.com help?
i want to publish a story but im new ive been tring to see where it is

i'm pretty sure, after you're logged in, its in the upper right hand corner.
Click the "Sign in" link in the top right hand corner, and then, on the account page, choose the "Publish" tab. This will allow you to publish stories.

More information is available on the "guide" link under this tab, which points to this page:
http://login.fanfiction.net/story/story_tab_main.php

Bear in mind that you cannot publish stories within 48 hours of registering with FanFiction.net.

Hope I've been of some assistance. :)
