Why Does My AT&T Internet Disconnect ALL The Time?!?
Ok, I recently moved and the house  i moved to has access to AT&T DSL internet. I love the speed and how fast it is but it disconnects me literally once an hour if I'm lucky...More most of the time. This is especially bad for streaming videos and online gaming. Now, all my phones have fliters on them and when it disconnects, my computer is still connected to the router, but instead of loading the web page gives me a message from the router saying the DSL connection is unavailable. And to top it off, if I have a download going from my web browser say..It keeps going! it says the DLS connection is unavailable and won't load wed pages yet downloads aren't interrupted! Although like i said online gaming and skype calls etc are. 
This has been frustrating to NO END and i would love LOVE if someone could help me..please!

I have at&t also but it doesn't disconnect on me as often as it does you. It disconnects on me when there will a rainstorm very often and once every 1 and a half weeks. Even though it doesn't disconnects on me as often as it does you, it is still pretty annoying. Make sure all of your cables and router is properly connected and functioning. If the problem continues, you have 2 options:

1. file a complaint to at&t
2. your problem might be caused due to bad coverage in your area. If so, you should switch to verizon, the cost of service is practically the same.
try and arrange to get the technician come and have a look..he will know the exact problem.....You shouldn't have taken ATnT in the first place. If you did not have a choice then that is ok.
