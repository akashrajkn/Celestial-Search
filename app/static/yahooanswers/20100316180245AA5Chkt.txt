Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?
here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item, then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?

and question number 2: if paypal/ebay does pay me back for the 5000$ are they going to take legal actions against the seller? or are they just going to bite the bullet and ban him from paypal/ebay for life?

I'm not sure if you have filed a claim with paypal, but I would try doing that.
I think buyer protection only covers up to about 2k in most instances.
Call the cops and try to sue the seller in small claims.

If you have 5k to drop on a camera then I think life will go on.
You're the one who has to take legal action against the seller.
