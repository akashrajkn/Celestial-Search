i accidently deleted a message that was really important and now i cant get it back. what do i do? please help. :( thanks

You pretty much nailed it by stating "forever".

Life's lesson #28238
Make backups of important data.
What kind of e-mail client are we talking about here? And i suppose you also removed it from the trash bin? Then the only option is looking for a regular (automatic) backup or using a HD Recovery tool.
Any chance you can contact the sender. If it was a person they might have a copy of the email in their sent folder. Hope this helps. Good Luck.
