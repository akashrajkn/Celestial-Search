Want to host my own website?
I want to host a website on my own server. All I need is  the domain name. Is there a way to get just that, and not the hosting?
One problem with .tk though, when I go to sign up the image that says "type these characters" doesn't display...

www.domain.com

There are tons of places for that.
Anywhere, google to compare, I use 1and1.com
Depends what you plan to do. Dot.Tk is a good one for forums. Most others will cost money per month usually. A good one for starting is wetpaint, which is easy to use. I've heard Go Daddy works great, but I have no experience with it.
