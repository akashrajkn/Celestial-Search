is narcomundo.com a scam?
my friend who is a meth addict has been clean for 5 months now but still gets large cravings for meth. the website narcomundo says it has a legal alternative you can buy called "crank powder" which is 100% legal amphetamine alternative and my friend really wants to buy it. do you think it is a scam? if you dont know check out the website : http://www.narcomundo.com/store-mall/#Crank%20Powder

This question cant be serious.
If he has been clean for 5 months, than he has no need for crank powder, unless he wants to get hooked. Tell him that the meth craving will pass eventually and crank powder can only be harmful. After all, even if it is legal, it is still probably harmful. I am pretty sure that the website itself is a scam.
Well, I think it's a scam. A legal high? Seriously, drugs are illegal for a reason ~
"narcomundo"??? are you serious? just the name smells of scam a mile away. don't do it! you'd be taking a huge chance with your health as well as with your money
