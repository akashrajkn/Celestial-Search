How Can I send a direct message on twitter?
Can you do that if I am following them but they haven't sent me a message?

Hi Alex,

The person you want to Direct Message must be following you. You can reply to a post and ask them to DM you.
You can only send direct message to person who follows you. 

You can send a direct message simply by adding the character ¡°d¡± before the user name.

Example; direct message to Alex
d Alex Saints win the Superbowl!

Only the person you are directing this message to will see it.
