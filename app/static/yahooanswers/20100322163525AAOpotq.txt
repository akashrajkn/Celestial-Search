It's the same for everyone. At least in France (I'm French, and by the way, sorry for my bad English)... Today, after they upgraded their website, it becomes slow. 

slippery has nothing to do with your magnificient Mac PowerPc G4 !! I have 4 gb of  Ram and it's still stuck and frozen for me either.
