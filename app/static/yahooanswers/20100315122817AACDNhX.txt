Questions about Lockerz?
Well, they're having a redemption to whoever gets the most points: the US versus everyone else.
So what do you do? On the date of the redemption do you just pick a prize and get it if there is stock left? Or is it you spend points and put your name into the possibility of getting the prize and it goes out to a random amount of people?

I'm basically asking that if you spend your points, are you guaranteed a prize?


BQ:  What's the chance of getting something like a Wii console or a iPod Touch? Should I just stick with getting a video game?
I know that... -.-

Will they say that the item is out of stock is what I'm asking. 
Of course they wouldn't give out thousands of Xbox 360's and computers just like that...

You are not guaranteed a prize, lockerz is basically a loterry, or a pyramid scheme at epic proportions. How do you think they'd make money if everyone was guaranteed a prize?
Considering how quickly everything goes out of stock, it seems likely that you're guaranteed a prize.
