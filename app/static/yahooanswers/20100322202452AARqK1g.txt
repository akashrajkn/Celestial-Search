i'm having problems with veoh?
i log on, i search for a video, i try to play it, then it takes me to a screen that says "Server cannot be found".  it usually happens to the long videos but what does that mean? is it saying that they cant play the video or do i have to download a newer version of the veoh web player?

someone help me please! it's been bugging me for the past couple of weeks that i can't watch these videos

Veoh has filed for bankruptcy (back in February), this means they will have got rid of their staff, it also means they will problably not work either, with or  without newer software. The site is probably not being maintained either.
