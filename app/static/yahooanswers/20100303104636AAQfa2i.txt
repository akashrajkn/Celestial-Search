firefox doesnt play videos but IE does?
i just downloaded firefox.it doesn't play any videos on youtube.
youtube says either my javascript is didabled or i have older version of flash player.
i checked and found my javascript is enabled.
but the same video works perfectly well on Internet Explorer.
pls. help i wanna use firefox.

you just need to go to firefox and install https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7
You need to upgrade your Flash player - You can do this by going to this link & installing the plugin:
http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
I hope this helped!

Hi Chirag j


For what I've found it appears you need to uninstall then re-install the Adobe Flash plugin.
flash isnt enabled/installed
