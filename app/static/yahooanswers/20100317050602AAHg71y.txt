What operating system do you have? In Windows 7, sound that coming from your browser can be turn on and off or change the volume from your sound settings in your task bar beside the clock. Click it then click the mixer and see if the volume from your browser are turned up all the way.

I am not sure in XP because I haven't use XP in a while.
maybe you can try using antoher browser, like firefox or google chrome... If that doesn't work you might want to reinstall your flash player.

sorry for my bad english
