Would you Buy Stuff on Ebay for 1 pence?
Would you buy things, say, a mobile phone or something expensive, off the website Ebay? Do you think its safe, and that the item will work properly?


HELP!
Thanks in advance.

Ebay is fine, it's dodgey sellers you need to watch out for, look for good feedback and make sure the item has no faults and you will be fine.

Have purchased plenty of electronics off ebay, and they have all been fine so far.
Common sense applies. I've bought things from ebay over the years (not a lot, but enough). I would be suspect of an expensive item going for so cheap. Send emails to the seller asking why it is so cheap, if there is anything wrong with it, why they are getting rid of it. If you are still leary, stay away.
You can buy some very good bargains on ebay, you just have to be careful who you buy off, I've have bought a lot of ebay and they have been alright, last week I bought a DVD recorder it was new I got it for ?75, but don't buy anything with out using pay-pal.
Why not? I sold an electronic Yamaha organ on Ebay for 1p. There was nothing wrong with it. I would have had to pay to have it taken away!
