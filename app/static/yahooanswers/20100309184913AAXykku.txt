Where can I watch free movies online?
Recently my computer had a virus so my mother had to get it fixed so she went to Best Buy and they gave her this Trend-micro security crap and now loads of websites are blocked so the website also has to be legal and possibly ad. free. Please help me out.

watch-movies.net  best website to watch movies/tv/ ufc fights :D

this is the #1 free movie watching website.
http://www.hulu.com/
http://www.fancast.com/
No free website would be add free as this is partly how they pay for the website.
Type free movies into search and take a look.
http://www.hulu.com
http://entertainment.att.net/movies

The only *legal* site to watch free movies online is Hulu.com

The other sights are still active only because they are located outside of the US and so the US can't force them to shut down due to copyright infringement (...well youtube is slightly different, that more of them activly trying to enforce copyright laws, but they can't be peanilized if a few videos slip through the cracks).

I'm sure you want to watch movies legally so as not to cheat the video companies of their hard earned royalties.  Just like you never pirate songs or drive over the speed limit.  Right!?
I had trend micro a few years ago and you can go in to an area and set it to block or not to block.Cannot remember exactly how. On your trend micro main box check internet security settings. Personally i got rid of trend and have had Avast for the last couple of years and never had a virus get through.

You can watch free movies online from http://lanjut.in/9051
Best site I have found this far. It is absolutely free.
A lot of new movies are on this site but you can also find all the classics. Also many movies that are now airing in theaters, can be found here. You can watch different TV shows as well on the same website for free. Movies are full length and high quality. You have the option to just watch them or if you want, download them. Hope this helps you! Enjoy!
