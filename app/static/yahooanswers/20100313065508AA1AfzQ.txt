How to stop Firefox download window from popping up in Mac?
I have a Mac and use the latest version of Firefox. I want the download window to stop popping up every time i save like a picture or something. For instance when i save a picture i see in firefox, the download window pops up saying what i've downloaded and stuff. How do i get that pop up window to stop popping up everytime i save something to my computer (like a picture) in Firefox? I can't find anything in preferences in firefox either. PLEASE HELP!

I hated that too.

I use Windows, but as far as I know, the extensions work in both operating systems. I use an extension called Download Statusbar. Instead of using the downloads window, it puts all the downloads on a little strip at the bottom of the screen. It's far less intrusive, and it looks pretty nice too.

Good luck!

In the location field of Firefox, type:
about:config

Press Return.

You will see a long list of parameters. In the "Filter" field at top, type:
browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting
(That is "browser. download. manager. showWhenStarting" but without the spaces. Yahoo Answers is wacky about not allowing long "words")

Where you see "true", double-click to change it to "false".

(By the way, this isn't a Mac thing. You need to do the exact same thing in Firefox for Windows or Linux.)
