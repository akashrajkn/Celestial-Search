Is there a firefox add on that can download a full episode of something from ABC.com?
They have full episodes and I was just wondering if there was a program or firefox add on that can download it onto my computer, thanks!

Consequently there is no "LEGAL" add on because all episodes are copyright protected. Although there may be an "ILLEGAL" add on out there but I would not recommend trying to find one because you can go to Federal Prison. Hope this helped
