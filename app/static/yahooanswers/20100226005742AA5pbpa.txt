What should I name my personal website?
So, I have to make a personal website for my IT course.
It basically just has to give information on ourselves, our lives, our interests etc.

I'd like a creative name for it that will make it stand out from the crowd, but I can't think of anything.
And I don't want the title to have my name in it.
Any ideas?

scratch your mind then you get answer.
"everyone has a site", is a lil long but it suits you
You ask, we answer.
usually if its a personal website then your name or nickname should figure in. you don't want that, then ok! try this name: itcoursesforyou / ithelp / ...
I can't really choose your site name for you, but try to keep the name 3 words or less preferably 2 or less. Make the title flow and make it unique. If you don't want your name in it then use a nickname or something you're good at. Maybe something that interests you like a hobby. Since we don't know any of those things we really can't help but hopefully I gave you a push in the right direction. =]
The course tutor might actually be expecting the website to feature your name as a random name you believe to be "cool" might not be considered appropriate in this situation
