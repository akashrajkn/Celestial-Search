Does this happen to any of y'all?
Okay i've been using yahoo answers for a while now.
On my profile I made it to where people may instant message me or email me if they like.Usually to contact eachother about yahoo answer questions or just to have a nice chat.But i've been getting these instant messages from these sluts who want me to see there cam or these horny ass guys who just talk about sex. i'm engaged and everything and my man wouldn't like that shit...ya know?
Then when i tell them off they say your problem is..is that your a virgin.I'm like for 1.... i have a STD which would make it impossible for me to be a virgin.2 i'm faithful in my relationships. So does any of this every happen to any of you. thanks.I will vote for best answer. Sorry i don't think i put it in the right category.
Okay i do have an STD but that doesn't mean that I'm unfaithful in the past relationships that I've had.Just means that someone i was dating 2 years ago told me that he was clean when he wasn't....Sad thing was...after i got an outbreak he still didn't know that he had it. lol.I found out from his ex girlfriend lol

It's good that you're faithful in your relationships.  A key point is to have just one relationship at a time.  And if you're faithful, how do you get a STD?
The internet is turning bad....there is probably an option to block these people.  If not, then deselect the option of  people being able to IM you or email you.  : )


Such a sad thing that the internet is full of such discusting people...I pray for them.
Rename yourself Mrs.STD, they might stop then.
I would be true faith to god and make sure no one can message me
but thats me and if my g/f was doing this I would give her away because to me thats cheating

once a cheater always a cheater
i will suggest u that change your yahoo profile picture first that will help you a lot... coz u added a bad picture... that cozed u this problems...
