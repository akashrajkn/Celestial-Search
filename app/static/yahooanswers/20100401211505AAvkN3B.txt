What is the name of a website where people are actively posting songs?
Sometime last year, I discovered a website in which people are constantly posting songs, like their favorite songs or just songs they're interested in. I believe it was live or actively being done. In other words, the web-page was constantly being reloaded with songs that people were actively posting. I vaguely remember you can create a profile, and like i said post songs. It seemed like a mix of social networking with music and internet radio. 

I cannot remember much else. Thank you very much for any feedback.
