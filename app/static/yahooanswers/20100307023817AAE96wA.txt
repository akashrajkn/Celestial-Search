Do any of you use the website Forcespenpals.co.uk?
I'm thinking of signing up to it and I was wondering what the sites like? I really just want to meet new people who are living different kinds of lives to me..I feel I need some enrichment!

I don't know many people who are on this site, but you can give it a go!

also try swagbucks, its like you earn points which can go towards free stuff, it might be a useful thing for you to go on, http://swagbucks.com/refer/MissHannahx
