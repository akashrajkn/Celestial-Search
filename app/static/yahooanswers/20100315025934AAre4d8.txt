question about photobucket's album privacy?
if i upload a photo to an album which is set to private, and i post that picture to a forum, will others on the forum be able to see the picture?

If you can see it so can they. If they are two separate sites, then your browser won't know that only you have permission to view the photo on photobucket.

On photobucket, private albums can't be viewed, but if they know the link then they can see the pic, so yeah you can still show images from a private album.
