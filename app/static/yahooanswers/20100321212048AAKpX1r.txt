Is there any way you can tell where a picture came from online?
If someone sent me a random picture in an email, is there any way I can trace it to where it originated? Like someone else's myspace, or etc.

http://www.tineye.com/ is about as close as you're going to get. I don't think it has every picture published on there though, so it may be a hit or miss whether you get results on it or not. It's still an interesting site to use, though.
