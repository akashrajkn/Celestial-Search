What can't I register for a Hotmail account?
So today, I was trying to sign-up for my very first Hotmail account, but eventually I was not able to. While I was on my way filling up the necessary details, I am now on the final step, which is to type down the code which they gave. I do not know how to enter it, is there and "enter" button there that I did not find? I am sure I typed it correctly, but they keep making me repeat it. In the end, I was not successful; they told me to wait for another day. How come? But I was not even able register for one and they are telling me I have reached the maximum limit of signing-up for a day. All help would be appreciated. Thank you.

Hotmail accounts will only cause you trouble.  Make one at gmail.
Try for the next day or contact their support. You may have simply entered the code wrongly. Try an audio code if you are having trouble.
Try audio code
I agree, gmail is the best
Make sure you are indeed typing it correctly. If it does not auto-cap letters, make sure you make them the appropriate capitalization. Make sure to tell the difference from, for example, 1, and I. Listen to it by sound (like others suggested). Or try a different mail:
http://mail.yahoo.com
http://mail.google.com/mail/signup

[Finally, your ISP may provide E-mail accounts, (providers such as comcast, etc)
