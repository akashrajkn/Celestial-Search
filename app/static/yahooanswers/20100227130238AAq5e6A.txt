How does twitter work?
I was just wondering about sending messages to people. I don't have a twitter myself but when you look at someones twitter and a tweet has someone else's name at the start is that from that person or to the person who's twitter you're on?
So who is sending the message to who?

It means the person is sending an ' at reply ' to them, so it's like a message.
The @ is from the person sending the message. The @name is included as part of the message length and twitter only allows 140 characters, so the longer the name, the less room left for a message.
