What happens if customers download illegally on our Wi-Fi?
The British government has proposed a bill that will allow internet connections to be slowed, or even temporarily cut, if illegal downloads have been performed using that connection.

Our family business is about to start providing free Wi-Fi as a service to customers, but our home uses the same connection - if customers illegally download music, movies etc on our connection, will it be possible to prove that it was not us and/or take measures to stop customers from doing so?

You can block internet traffic similar to how schools and businesses do.  I am not familiar with how this is done, but it involves buying an expensive router that can be customized to block ports, programs, and .exe's like BitTorrent and LimeWire.
Yes. It will be very possible to prove it.

BUT, the legal bill will be paid by you to prove your innocence.
