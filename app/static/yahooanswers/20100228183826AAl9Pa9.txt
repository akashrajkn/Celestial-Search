Is there really prepaid internet?
I was watching HSN the other day and they were showing a Virgin Mobile Broadband USB Flash drive like device. They said also something about Sprint and its network.

If you can prepay for minutes to talk on a phone why not prepay for internet. on the other hand, software typically checks for updates from it's website automatically  which would use your prepaid minutes every time you'd start an application.
It probably exist, but it's up there with paying for radio like Sirius.
In a word, yes.

Since lots of people are moving away from the idea of contract mobile broadband for 2 years, there's been a surge of prepaid mobile broadband providers such as Virgin Mobile moving in to fill the gap.

Most of them simply lease the service of a larger provider (Virgin leases Sprint's network as you heard) and then repackage/resell it as their own. The upside to this is the service is solid and not a garbage like connection.

Since their are 2 types of prepaid providers (occasional use and regular use), it also depends on how often you plan to use the internet.
