Do you know a site that pays you to bring new members?
Do you know any sites that pay well for recruiting and finding people to join them.Thanks!

I did back in 1999 when the venture capital was flowing like champaign at the end of the Daytona 500, but these days I'd be surprised to hear of anyone doing that.
People would just use referral getting sites if no participation was needed
the legit sites require the people you get to participate but some sites which do  offer that are
cash-crate,pretty much every PTC,swag-bucks.
