Should my username be my company's name?
I am signing up for article submission sites, forums, and other online discussion boards to post info to help market my company. Should I use my company name as the username or have something a bit more unique?

no don't use your company name for online stuff unless its legal and you have too..   I did that with my business at first, all sorts of headaches came from it.
