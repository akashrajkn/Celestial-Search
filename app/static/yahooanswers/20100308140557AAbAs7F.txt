Which one do you prefer ? Facebook or Twitter ?
or Google Buzz ?
Try to give some arguments.
Thanks.

None? I must admit I keep Facebook tabbed but I often wonder why. Lots of people I haven't spoken to in ten years tagging photos of people that I don't know... Twitter seems so low attention span I can;t get myself to spend more than five minutes on it at a time. I have never even seen Google Buzz. I actually spend most of my time here, for some unknowable reason.
Face Book. I hate twitter.
