Upgrading to Firefox 3.6 from 3.5.8 and keeping the Settings & Bookmarks. Do I need to uninstall first ?
hi.

I wanted to keep my bookmarks & settings etc.
Are they gonna be automatically stored ?
I think they are gonna be stored in firefox setting folder... right ? then be used/updated by the new firefox ..?

And Do I need to uninstall my firefox 3.5.8 first before installing the update ???
or is it automatic

I ran Vista 64

thanks

Just do the upgrade, everything will be kept intact.
The new version will automatically get the configurations and setting from the older one, so no worries go ahead.

Regards
