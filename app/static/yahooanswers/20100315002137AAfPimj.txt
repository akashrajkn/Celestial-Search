**Twitter question!!*** SHOULD I GO ON THOSE "GET MORE FOLLOWERS SITES" ?
im new to Twitter. loving it so far. just wondering any1s opinion on those "get more followers" sites. just wondering if they're worth trying??, OR not. anything helpz!

No, no, no, no, no and NO.

Against Twitters' terms of service, not worth doing because it could get you banned. And they won't be 'true' followers, just fake accounts made to follow you.

(I am assuming you're talking about the sites where you 'buy' followers)
To be honest, a lot, if not ALL,  of those sites are spaming. They'll just hack your account and try to advertise something. It's not a good idea whatsoever. Even if you only have 1 or 2 followers, it's better than nothing.
