Is there an internet provider with unlimited access that is at a fairly reasonable price?
We have verizon wireless right now and we go over sometimes, is there an internet provider like that, or one that has a lot of GB usage

Time Warner doesn't have any limitation!
they undoubtedly have an unlimited package, as does every provider... sprint for instance is $69 last time i checked... unlimited phone service w/ unlimited data...
