How to do I keep that menu bars at the top and at the bottom, stay in it's place?
I use Internet Explorer and on any site that I go on, the bar at the top and the bottom of my screen (I think they are called status bars) are not visible unless I put my mouse on it. I want it visible all the time. How do I change this?

Click on the Menu item View and in Toolbars check the items you want to see.

If your browser in in full screen mode, press F11 to restore it.
If you don't see the menu, press Alt to make it appear.
