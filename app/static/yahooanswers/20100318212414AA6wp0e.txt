Go to your facebook page, then click the letters in the web adress once and it should highlight blue.
 (The web adress is the letters up top in that rectangle that normally began with "www." or "http://", here's a picture http://www.freemarketmediagroup.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/web-address.jpg ) 

Then, right click and go done to "copy"

Then, go to where ever you want it

Find someplace to type, you should have that flickering type bar

right click again and go down to "paste"
go to your profile and hit the info thing and then in one of the things theres a place to put your URL of the web and that will make the link on your profile(=
