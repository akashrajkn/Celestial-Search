Streaming Video Problem?
When i try to view a video from websites like youtube, a warning comes up saying that I do not have the latest Adobe's Flash Player and must download it for me to be able to watch the video. However when i do click the link to download and install Adobe, a virus threat pops out saying that the installer has viruses. Does any one have a virus free solution?

instead of clicking the link (often a dangerous thing to do) go to google and key in adobe flash player from there and then you will know you have gone into the right website before downloading.
Hello my friend,

Go here to download Adobe Flash: 

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
 
A lot of times however, its not the case, and it may just be a virus. Try running an antivirus, like Malwarebytes (http://www.malwarebytes.org/)

Also, try using a different internet explorer. Try using Google Chrome, my personal favorite after moving from Firefox, has a lot less issues like this.

Good luck my friend, hopefully I helped!
true you should download the flash player from a legit site but your antivirus may still pose as a problem and may stop your videos from streaming ( kaspersky has done this before). so if your videos still arent working go to your anti virus and disable the web antivirus (only. do not touch your virus scanners)
