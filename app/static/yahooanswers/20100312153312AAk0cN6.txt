How about some site where I can stream my favorite tv shows?
Anything will help. Thanks for your time!

Try Hulu.com  You can watch NBC shows like The Office, Community, 30 Rock, SNL, there's a lot more, too.

Really good site how it works is 

type in the box a show that you like if its on there it will show click on it than click on the episode that you wanna watch click on the link to it 

and enjoy
