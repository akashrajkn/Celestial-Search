Everytime I try to exit out of a tab a little thing pops up and says "Internet explorer has stopped working"?
I seriously think I totally screwed up my laptop. I downloaded Firefox and like a bunch of crap came with it and now whenever I turn on my laptop a bunch of little things pop up, telling my about the weather and virus scans and stuff. I don't want that! I am not very expirenced with computers, I'm only 14 so someone please help!

This could be an automatic virus scanner affecting your internet explorer (AVG Internet security does this). It will go away with time, but it could slow down the browser.
Sometimes a program can just be corrupted leading to malfunctions like this.

If this is the case your best bet is to uninstall internet explorer and then reinstall it.

You should be able to get internet explorer from the microsoft website again after you install it, just like you did with firefox.
Leave internet explorer and start using firefox or better google chrome
