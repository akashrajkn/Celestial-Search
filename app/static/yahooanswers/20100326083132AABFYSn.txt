In Amazon.com do I Have to pay shipping and handling no matter what?
cause i bought a ipod case and i dont know if i have to pay shipping and handling...cause i want to buy a game and im not sure if i have to pay...
Item(s) Subtotal:  $2.22
Shipping & Handling: $0.00
  
So does this mean that it doesnt cost anything

Depends if it is directly from Amazon or another seller.  It is always clearly marked.  If it is from Amazon and is over $25, it is free shipping.
