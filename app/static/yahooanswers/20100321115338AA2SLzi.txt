Thanks for joining Swaptree! 

The reason some trades will not set up for you is likely due to the account status of the other user, for instance they may have paused their account or reached their trade limit. Therefore they are not currently available for any trades. 

We have over 5 million items in our trade database. Trades are matched, initiated, accepted or rejected constantly. As these trades change status so does the status of the items. In addition traders add and remove items constantly. One trader pausing their account effectively removes all that traders items from the active trade pool, another trader coming back from vacation and un-pausing their account effectively adds all that traders items back to the trade pool. All this constant and simultaneous activity makes the database extremely dynamic. 

It is not unusual to see an item come and go and to see your own ¡°get now¡± selections change quickly. We reviewed your account and see you have items on both your want list and your have list. Swaptree will find trades for you and when we do we will send you an e-mail which allows you to accept or reject the trade. 

Thank you again for using Swaptree, and if you have any other questions or need any more assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know.
