How much is adultfriendfinder and virtuagirlhd making and why are its ads everywhere? I see it on almost every gaming website except the big ones like gamefaqs, gamestop, gamespot etc. its very annoying. im 17. it doesnt bother me at all whatsoever but i was just asking out of pure curiousity why its ads are everywhere and how their stock is doing. how many adults pay for that stuff a year and how much does the porn industry make a year? I just installed a firefox extension called "noscript" since the ads tend to slow the webpage from loading fast. if the porn ads or whatever were loaded later and not first on the page, i wouldn't have installed noscript but yeah... thanks!
