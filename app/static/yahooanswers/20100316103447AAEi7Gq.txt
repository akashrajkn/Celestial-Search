Is weebly or worpress better?
I need to create my own website and i need a little more info

Weebly and Webs.com is really good. Wordpress is also good and Blogger is my recommendation. I use it and I'm very glad of it. It's good and I always find myself using it very easily.
wordpress is the best one with millions templates and scripts, even if you are going to setup a blog they will give you free host to not in .org, go to wordpress.com
