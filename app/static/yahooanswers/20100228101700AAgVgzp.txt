My firefox got stuck please help quickly!!!!?
I was on youtube and clicked on a new video when it just stopped and it started loading with that circle thingy and I don't know what to do. I can't turn off the computer because we hve stuff that needs to be saved in other windows up. How do I get the page to go away? PLEASE HELP BEFORE MY DAD GETS HOME

You obviously unfroze it in order to be able to post this
Hmmm.  Were you looking at something that you shouldn't have been?  Maybe take this as a lesson learned?

Anyway, you didn't say if this was a Mac or a Windows machine.  Here's what I'd do for each (sorry, I don't know Vista or Windows 7):

WindowsXP:
Hit control-alt-delete to bring up the Windows Task Manager.  
Click on the "Applications" button.
Highlight Firefox
Hit the "End Task" button

Mac:
Click on the Firefox icon
Hit apple-Q to force-quit FF

If none of that works and your computer isn't completely hung, another option is to go save the other stuff and simply reboot the machine.
