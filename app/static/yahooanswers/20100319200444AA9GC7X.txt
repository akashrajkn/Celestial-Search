Where in **** can I enter Bakugan's DNA code?
I want on the site "www.bakugan.com" and I got absolutly not a clue where to enter the code!! 
(P.S.: I just want to help my brother with his heum... Bakugan passion..)

The codes are for a new Bakugan game that is coming soon. The website does not give a date for the launch, so keep checking back.
bakugan dimensions are not online yet but it will be online on april 5th
It's true what they say.  The game is not available as of right now.  I have heard from their community website that the game will become available on April 4th.  I check everyday just to make sure the game isn't there yet.  I have already about 8 new Bakugans with 8 different codes that I also want to enter on the game.  I can't hardly wait!!!
