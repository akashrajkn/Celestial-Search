What does "Like New" mean on Ebay?
on ebay there is the condition thingy and it says like: brand new, like new, etc.

does like new mean brand new not out of the box but had it for a while, used but not for long, or what??

Thanks for your help!

Means that it's not new but in top condition, e.g. like new.
like new is the better side of used
