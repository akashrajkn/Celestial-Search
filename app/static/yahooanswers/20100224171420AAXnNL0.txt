Do you trust the website beast kicks?
On the site shoes are really cheap, but can i trust the site with my credit card.
Has any one ever purchased from here? If so how did it go? here is the link

I HAVE ORDERED ONCE FROM THEM, IN JANUARY, AND GOT MY SHOES IN 6 DAYS.  I ORDERED THE ROYAL BLUE FOAMPOSITES.  A COUPLE OF MY BUDDIES HAVE ORDERED AND GOT THEIR SHOES IN ABOUT 7 DAYS.  THE SHOE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD!  I WILL BE ORDERING THE EGGPLANT & BLACK FOAMPOSITES TODAY!  I WILL POST A NOTE WHEN I GET THEM.
