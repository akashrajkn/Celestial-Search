my laptop won't let me on twitter anymore. why?
every time i try to go to twitter's website, firefox closes on me and asks to restore my session.
this onnnnly happens with twitter.

anybody have a clue as to why?

a. An add-on being accessed by Twitter's web might be crashing or is already corrupted
Try to re-install the plug-ins/add-ons.
b. Your parents installed a special software that restricts your system to browse in Twitter
Give mommy a kiss and give daddy a big hug.
c. Something is wrong with FireFox's "cookies" and/or "cache" files
Clear FireFox's history (open FireFox, select 'History' from menu then 'Show all...', click 'Organize' then 'Delete')
d. Twitter's script is bugged?
Try again sometime.
shut it down turn it back on hit F10 and restore it to an earlier date there is probably a setting that got adjusted and you can back it up to reinstall the old settings just follow the prompts :)
