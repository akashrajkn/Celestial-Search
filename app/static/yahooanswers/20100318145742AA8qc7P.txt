How do you save a layout on pimp.myyearbook?
I sound like a total idiot because I've been doing these for a while but I made a layout it looks good and everything I just can't find the Save button or whatever button they use. This is the website: http://pimp.myyearbook.com/pimplayouteditor.php Thanks

Click (On Your Keyboard) Print Scrn and go to Paint.
Then click ctrl v (paste) and up will come that screen. 
Then take your mouse and box the area you need, new paint window, ctrl v, and save.
