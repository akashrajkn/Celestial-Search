What kind of punishment to inflict on people who write "LOL"?
We need not debate the appropriateness of using it, that's a moot point.
Simply give a creative suggestion of a suitable ordeal for them...
I thought of one too! Drop them out of a ROFLCOPTER (http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Roflcopter#Roflcopter)

A six hour English grammar lesson. LoL!
Castration

LOL
i say you put them through a nice dose of LMAO then kick it up a notch by LMAOing them and just to round it all off you LMFAO all night long
1- Type the following text in your response: "ROFL, LMAO, HAHAHAHA"
2- Select and Copy text in quotes above on the Clipboard (Ctrl-C)
3- Place cursor after the last A in HAHA...
4- Click Ctrl-V repeatedly until you get bleeding blisters on your index finger
5- Click the Send button...
LOL is the least of our worries - what about those who continually use text speak , e.g.  "gud 4 u"  or can't spell or use bad grammar ,  e.g. can't tell the difference between -  their , there and they're - or my particular hate -  use "could of " instead of "could've".
 - there I've got it out of my system at last .
Oh - I forgot your question - they should be made to attend English grammar lessons similar to the ones we had in the '50s complete with clause analysis etc.
Remove their computer for six months and take a lump hammer to it for a subsequent offence
Actually LOL stands for "Low on Learning" which usually reflects a low IQ, therefore one has to make allowances for their inadequacies to understand the question in hand.

Thus they write LOL in response as an answer because they have lent their single braincell to the dog therefore they are incapable of giving an intelligent answer.

This is a well known and established fact as dogs always look far more intelligent than some of their owners!
