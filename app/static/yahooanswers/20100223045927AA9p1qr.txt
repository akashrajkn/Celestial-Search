why is firefox so slow?
very annoying, i double click the icon and wait 2 minutes...nothing, then i double click and.. wait it remembered the 1st time so now i have 2 browsers loading up in slow motion. I go to x out one of the browsers but it doesnt budge so i x again and guess what! it remembered the first time so now both browsers are slowly going away before my eyes and i find myself in the same scenario i was in at the beginning... what causes this to be so slow and how can i fix it?
can i save my bookmarks?

that is the virus in your pc.
scan the pc and heal the virus and restart your computer. you can see more faster than before.
Completely remove firefox, delete your firefox profile and start anew.

To find your Firefox profile folder, press the Windows + R shortcut keys to bring up the RUN dialog box. You can also type the command directly into the Start search menu (for Vista and Win 7 users only)

Type in this command:

%appdata%

and then hit enter.

In the folders that appear, find one that is labelled "Mozilla", and delete all it's contents. (This forces Firefox to generate a new profile when it's installed again)

Once you've done that, re-download Firefox (the latest version) and install it again.
To save your bookmarks, open Firefox, go to Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks, click Import & Backup > Export HTML, navigate to location to save it, click Save. Once you've re-installed Firefox, do the same process except select Import HTML
