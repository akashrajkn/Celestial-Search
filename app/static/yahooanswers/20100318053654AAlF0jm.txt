Why do people prefer IE over Firefox?
I mean, IE is slower, makes that annoying "click" sound when you click on something (you know what I mean), has a confusing tab system, and crashes a lot more.

Uh, you answered the most yourself! :) But there's also one more thing: the add-ons. There are thousand extenes for firefox out there, which are very helpful. From quick translating to mini-games and information abour your PC. You can find many of them here: https://addons.mozilla.org . I hope it helped.
I think the majority of the reason is that it's what they know since it comes with Windows (except if you're in the EU, you get a choice there) and because they think there is ONE browser.

When I talk to my users about switching they seem unaware there IS a choice as they have been using IE so long or that it's what came with Windows.

It's basically akin to the saying 'you don' know what you're missing'. If you don't have anything for comparison you don't know how bad your existing option(s) are.
I think it is because most people don't want to have to learn a new program, and because IE comes with all Windows computers, they use that.
I use  google chrome and so far its the fastest of the 3 so I like it more.
No one preffers IE, if they use IE is because they don't know about Firefox.
IE sucks... Render issue, Security issue, Stability issue, Speed issue, etc.

Also updates are released after long periods.
