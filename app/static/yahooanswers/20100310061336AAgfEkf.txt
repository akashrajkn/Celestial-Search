What is the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web?


Nothing they are the same thing - Think the world wide web was just a user friendly term to sell itself
Nothing except the name.

The world wide web is the framework of the internet....well thats the way i see it anyways?

Internet is the content....the world wide web is the framework

The world wide web is newer than the internet.  Email is sent over the internet.  Colleges had email from the early 90s.  The web came around 95.
internet is a network of networks...all "networks" in the world connected to each other...

WWW is simply the content..
Nada!
