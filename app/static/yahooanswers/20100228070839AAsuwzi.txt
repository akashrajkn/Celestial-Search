Calling all swag bucks users(read below)?
im a user as well, do u think with SwagBucks new update of each 1sb being worth 10sb now that they are ripping us off. because before when they gave us swagcodes it was worth like 1 or 2 swag bucks now they are worth only like 5 which is'nt even 1 original sb. 
so im pretty sure they are ripping us off now cause now its gonna take longer to get prizes because the swagcodes dont really help anymore

Yeah thats what i thought the first day but not now. Its still all free so just be happy or don't use it anymore. We still get swagbucks even if they are not what the used to be worth. And not necessarily to taking longer to win prizes. Referrals are the easiest way to help get extra swagbucks.
Hi, they are not ripping us off. Yes, they are giving swagcodes that are worth at least 5, but they are giving more than 1 swagbuck each day. This is worth more than 10 swagbucks (1 swagbuck)

Even though I do not like the new swagbucks, we must live with it.
