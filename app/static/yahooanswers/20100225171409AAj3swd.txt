How do you put a link for a download on your blog?
I see people who put links on their blog, and if you click on it, you can download music and such...I think you know what I mean. Like this : http://blog.akutoulovesyou.com/2010/02/dont-cross-streams.html  see the link?

You have to upload the music or video to your hosting account.  There is a way to upload in wordpress admin but I prefer just to use FTP.  Once it is uploaded to your site, then you just post a link to it so others can grab it.
