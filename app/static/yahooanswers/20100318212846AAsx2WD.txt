Can you receive payments on paypal if you dont have a bank account listed?
I have a paypal account but dont intend on buying anything, so I dont have a payment option listed.  I am using this just for receiving payments.  Can I still get the payment credited to my account? What will happen if someone makes a payment to me but I dont have a credit card or bank account on the paypal account? Thanks

The money goes in to your PayPal account, it comes from their bank account or credit card!
You can have a check mailed to you from paypal for a fee (limited to $500 withdrawn per month.)  You can also just keep the money in your paypal account to use to pay things.  From paypal's website "Withdraw Funds by Check A fee of $1.50 USD will be applied to each check withdrawal. To receive your money faster, you may transfer funds electronically to your bank account."
It sits in the Paypal account forever.  You have to action to get it out yourself, even if you have submitted your bank acc to them.
money go on your account.
