Is there any company who will redirect my ONLINE SHOPPING?
So im trying to buy clothes from riverisland.com and they ONLY ship to the UK, I live in USA and dont know if there are any storage/shipping companies who can ship my purchases from the UK to the US?

I'm an American expat in Germany, and I know how hard it is to find advice!  The only thing that I can say is that the company will not help you (tax, legal and liability reasons).  I'd suggest asking any friends you have in the UK to recieve the package for you and then to ship it to you privately.  Good luck!
