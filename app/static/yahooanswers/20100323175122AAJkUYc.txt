Craigslist issues????
So a friend of mine and I have, I guess you could call it a  ''Handy Jobs Service''
I was needing to post in ''Household services'' to advertise our services.
For some reason Craiglist is asking for a -PHONE NUMBER VERIFICATION-
To ensure that a phone is working in case of contact needs I guess.

So is craigslist suppost to be doing that, I mean I've never really had a craigslist account, flyers are for me.

Thanks alot in advance

Yes that is normal. They don't use it to allow people to call, they use it so that if they ban you for some reason, you won't be able to use the same number again.
