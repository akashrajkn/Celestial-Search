Ebay Question! can someone help me?
So i am trying to sell some more items on ebay, i have sold 5 items in the past, i always have 1 photo, so that it is free, i put in a description, and shipping...etc, i ALWAYS do whatever it would take to keep it free. but for some reason its coming up as it is a 35cent fee. SO, my question is, can you only sell a certain number of items for free? thanks! PLEASE HELP

the only thing that is free is the first pic on you ad any other pic is $0.35 each but if you want to redo your ad the first pic will be free on each ad
Usually the insertion fee depends on the starting bid, have you made the starting bid higher on this listing than previous ones?

There should be no reason why you are being charged unless you are asking a higher starting bid. When you put the starting bid in the box click on the hyperlink to the right that says "listing fees" and scroll down, that should tell you the threshold for free listings my guess you are just over the limit so drop your starting bid to whatever is the limit for free insertions if you don't want to pay. 

In Ireland where I live its not very high so I guess that might be your problem also certain categories have higher fees than others.  Message Ebay via their help pages if this isn't the reason.  

I usually add 50 cent on the P&P to help cover Ebay/Pay pal fees. I'm registered as a business seller so I don't get free listings at all any more at all and pay for every item I sell.
Here is the Ebay fee schedule:

BTW each additional picture hosted by Ebay is .15 cents

It sounds to me like you are doing BIN's. Those are .35 cents until March 30th. Then they go up to .50 cents.
