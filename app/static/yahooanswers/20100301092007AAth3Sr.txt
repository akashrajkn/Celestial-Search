What are some low cost ( under $20.00 a month), internet service providers?
DSL internet service provider, under $20.00 a month, reliable, and not too slow.
I live in Florida.

I would begin by going to google and putting in lowcost dsl internet providers.  I looked it up and Cox was 19.95 in Florida but their maybe lower cost services.
