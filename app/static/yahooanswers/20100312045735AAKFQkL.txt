Where are these re:tweets comming from?
Some times when I tweet on Twitter, my tweets are retweeted by users who are not following me.

How do they find my tweets lol?

Everybody's Tweets are show on the public timeline so the people retweeting may be searching that for, say, "bananas" and you've tweeted something about bananas that they think is worth repeating.

See http://twitter.com/public_timeline
Anyone can see your tweets (unless you've protected them). They might have been retweeted by one of your followers, and then one of THEIR followers retweeted... and so on.

The thing to remember with Twitter is that it's a bit like having a private conversation in a crowded bar. You might only be talking to your friends, but anyone can listen in!
