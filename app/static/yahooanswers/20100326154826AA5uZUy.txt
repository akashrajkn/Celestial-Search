What are good picture-sharing websites for kids?
I'm ten years old, and I have a really professional camera. It can take focus pictures, it can edit pictures, so, that means it's totally awesome. I would really like picture-sharing websites that I can share professional-looking pictures on. I need a website that allows ten year-olds. Can you help me?

While most photo-sharing sites will allow kids, a lot of creeps are on those sites as well. (By creeps, I mean people who take rather.. er.. non-child-friendly photos.)

I do generally wind up using photobucket, though. Nicer community than most of the other ones I've tried.
I've been on Flickr since I was 10!
