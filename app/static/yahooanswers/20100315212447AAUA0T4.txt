help with eBay?? Quick Pleasee?
well this is like my first time using eBay. and i want to buy this poster. so if i press "buy now" does that mean that its mine and it will be shipped to me? or can other people still bid on it? I dont want to be spending more money than i should be. or be owing somebody money that i don't know.

thanks in advance.

If you Buy It Now, then pay, its all yours.
If you "buy it now", then you are entering a contract, you have to pay the "buy it now" price +
 the shipping and the article is yours and should be shipped to you by the seller after you paid.
buy it now is exactly what it sounds like.  you are buying the item, therefore taking it off the market and other people cannot bid on it.
wow it's amazing i thought i was the only one who thought e bay was non user friendly. 
If you are not careful you can lose all your money there are a lot of scammers on there read carefully and always use the pay pal even thats not safe..


good luck.
