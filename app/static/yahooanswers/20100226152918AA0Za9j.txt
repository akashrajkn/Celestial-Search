i sent out an email about a teacher being a creep but now i'm worried?
could i get in trouble if a principal got it from my school? he really is a creep last year they had to give him a warning for something he said to one of his classes and the email i sent is just about getting him fired.

What done is done. Now wait and see
you could get in trouble, but it depends what the school's policies are.
such as at my old school you could get in trouble for having "bad stuff" on your facebook profile.
but outside of the school i dont think that they should be able to get you in trouble- but thats an opinion
I don't believe so. The teacher may get mad, but they can't do much about it anyways, so I wouldn't worry to much about itt.
