Return Policy on Amazon UK?
I got the product wrapped in bubble wrap in an envelope and I want to return it (it has corrupt data) but the Amazon return policy says that it must be returned in the packaging it came in. Of course, I threw recycled the envelope and threw away the bubble wrap as I thought they were rubbish. Will I have to sift through my rubbish to re-wrap it in the bubble wrap/envelope it came in?

Thanks ?

yes. and "threw recycled"?. methinks you tried to re-write that. get your hands in that bin Jackman
