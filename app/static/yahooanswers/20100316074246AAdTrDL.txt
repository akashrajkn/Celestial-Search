who do you host with in the UK and who is the best host for my small website idea?


I host my sites with FutureServers (futureservers.net), I've had no problems over the past 5 years and have more than one site hosted with them.

If you asked people with different hosts I'm sure they'd recommend the company they're with (if the support and services have been good), so really it's down to personal preference along with what services you require and how much you're willing to spend.
There are some good web hosting comparison sites around, we generally use http://www.hosting-picks.com/ before advising our clients on new hosting - they also have free SEO resources - good for kick starting your new website. From a quick look, Just Host currently seems to be the cheapest and from personal experience, they offer great service.
I suggest you this website http://www.tenhostingreviews.com where you can find a list of the Top 10 Web hosting companies with the best features, support and pricing. You can get everything you need and it's very easy. Hope this could help you.
Take into consideration that web hosting is a global service. It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or India. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
