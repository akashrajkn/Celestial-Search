Would someone tell me if they're able to view my broadcast?
I'm using an iPhone app called UStream that basically turns your iPhone into a webcam. I'm just curious to see if this even works. Could you go to http://www.ustream.tv/channel/brandonkmccleney and tell me if it's broadcasting? Thanks!

yes i can. congratulations
