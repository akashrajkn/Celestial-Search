Why does IE freeze up every time I close it?
I have IE 6.0 on my work computer and it runs fine. But when I close the window, it freezes up and I have to force it to close every time? Can someone help me fix this problem? Thank you.

Because IE6 is a horrible, horrible browser and one of the worst ever made. 

I know you probably don't have a choice, being at work and all. But since you are at work, why don't you ask their tech support guys to help you?
