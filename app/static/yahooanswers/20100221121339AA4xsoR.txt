How do I email Frank Warren?
I never understood how people comment on others' secrets, and sometimes, I want to say something too, but I don't understand where I email my message to? Does anyone know?
Frank Warren is the guy who created Postsecret by the way

Who the heck is Frank Warren?
Dear person who answered before me,
Who doesn't know who Frank Warren is?

To answer your question, I heard that his email is frank@docdel.com
I think you can also post threads on the post secret community board, but as far as his email, I think it is the one I just said. 
Hope this helps!
