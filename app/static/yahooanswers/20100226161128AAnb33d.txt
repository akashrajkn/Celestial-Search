Im having a problem logging into AOL right now, is anyone else?
it keeps saying the password is invalid, and when i click the forgot password button, the page wont load correctly... is anyone else having this problem or kno whats going on??

It's working for me.
I had the same problem, as well as many others.
You just have to wait around a bit, it's a problem with AOL.
Mine is finally up and running properly.
Good luck, and I hope it doesn't take too long for you.
:)
Ya me too! I have tried to log in various ways and it just say invalid password and username!
Same here too.

Noticed it late last night, and it's still the same this morning.

Grrrrr......AOHell....
