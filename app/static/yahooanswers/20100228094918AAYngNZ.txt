How do you apply the zoom effect on Glogster?

Zoom effect?... 

Well, if there's a video on the Glog, there's a button.. I can't remember what it looks like.. The button that's not the play/pause or the stop button. Click on that and the video will go full screen, and the Glog will still be behind it.

Also, if there's an image than was altered smaller, you can click it and the image will zoom to it's original size.


That's the only zooming I'm aware of.
