I'm looking for help creating my blog (blogspot.com)?
Alright. I started a blog a couple of days ago, and I'm really excited to get it started. Only problem is... I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've done all of the 'steps' blogger.com lays out for you (i.e. signing up, naming the blog, picking a template, etc) but... I want mine to look cool, like all of the other ones do.

So how do I go about making or finding a custom template? Please don't just say 'photoshop', because I don't know how to use that, either. Does the software come standard on computers, or do I need to download a certain program or something?

I'm also curious about how to make my own banner.

Thank you for your answers... I will definitely pick a best answer.
