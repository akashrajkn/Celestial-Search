Can the Magic Jack be used from outside the US? If yes, how?


Hi there.
I think you can make free calls in the US & Canada, outside you will pay international fees.
I recently wrote about this - http://nut.bz/1gho0w.k
Check it out, it has info which i pulled from the internet but things might have changed so your best bet will be to get into contact with the company that sell these.
Best off luck ;-)
