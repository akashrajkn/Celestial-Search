Selling broken items on E-bay?
I came across quite a strange seller, who's name was, sold_broken. Everything this seller sold was AS-IS. Lots of normally expensive stuff, marked way down. The thing is, I seen a buyer in the feedback, who'd bought like 50+ AS-IS items, alot of the items were the the same things to. Is this some kind of scam or system?

as-is doesn't mean it's broken... maybe it has a stain... or a tear.... or yeah maybe it's broken. but if it's cheaper ppl can fix it up
most likely a scam. sounds sketchy to me!
Most of these buyers are buying the for parts or think they can fix them.

So no, they are not scams.

Sometimes I look for broken laptops cause I need a few parts from them.
This is probably not a scam. Some people buy in bulk and get feedback on each item. That's why you see multiples of the same feedback. Plus, Ebay is VERY good at catching spammers.
That's just his name, it doesn't mean what he sells is broken.  Always read the description carefully!
Let's say you're making a custom device for tracking commercial trucks, and your design uses a certain cell phone to save engineering effort.  But you don't need the whole phone, just the circuit board with the main chips and transceiver.  Instead of spending $100 to buy a new cell phone with intact speaker, mic, LCD, keyboard, etc., you buy broken ones off eBay whenever they show up for $10, and probably 4 out of 5 work out for you.

After you get done with the parts you need from the phones, maybe 20% will have working screens and keyboards left over.  You put them up for sale on eBay and some guy who repairs phones for a living will snap them right up.

That's one of the (few) great reasons to use eBay -- your junk is literally someone else's treasure.
