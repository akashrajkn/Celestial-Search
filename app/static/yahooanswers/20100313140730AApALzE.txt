Sites similar to babblesex?
Does anyone know some?

http://www.literotica.com/  has an erotic chat and other things,but no profile pages,I'm upset about this as well,sure hope it comes back.A chat guy of mine was able to get in thru the way the first poster here has.He spoke to a chat mod and they told him the site was renewed and should be back up within 2 days.He copied and pasted the chat he had with the mod and showed me,so it's not just heresay.I added the copy and paste that worked from another similar question on here that my chat guy was able to get in thru and talk to the mod on.

there is no host for babblesex at the moment, it wont get up again ;(
