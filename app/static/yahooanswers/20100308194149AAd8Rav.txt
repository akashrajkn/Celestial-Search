When I open a case on eBay, how does eBay contact the seller?
I opened a case with a seller on eBay because I haven't received the item yet and he won't respond to my messages. I was just wondering how eBay contacts them. Do they call the person or what?

Probably email...
They send them a message.(actually its more like an alert) 
If you paid with paypal open a item not received dispute with them, wait a couple of days for a response & if the seller doesnt reply or refuses to help escalate to a claim.
