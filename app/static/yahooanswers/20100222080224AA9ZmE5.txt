Can anyone answer this please? about internet copyright...?
If there's a video of me online and i don't want anyone to see it, am i allowed to report and ask for it to be deleted... thanks

not unless you have a copyright on it
google copyright> and find the laws
yes potentially. Contact the hosting company or owners of the website and tell them the video is there without your permission and they may remove it,but the law is not clear about information in the public domain
