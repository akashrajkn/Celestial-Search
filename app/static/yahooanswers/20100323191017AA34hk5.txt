You're also supposed to be 14 years old.
Nope. neither is Chatroullete(just a heads up)
Nope, definitely not. I had one since I was 13 and nearly every single video chat room I entered was hosted by someone weird, someone quiet, sleeping, or invisible. If the host was not wacko, then someone else in the room was. Some people are so weird, they just... My point is, I should have not gone there. Unless! For serious business (i.e. Dating, playing music live online, DJ, meetings, etc). It is a great tool used by mostly unusual people. If you get addicted to it, you will probably be staying up 24/7. I know I did.
No, it has an age limit for a reason.
