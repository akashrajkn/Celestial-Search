Can someone help me find this site?
Ok im looking for this one site that I went on last year. I forgot the name, it was really confusing like something french but, im not too sure. It started with an o and I think the second letter was a u. in the website you could make a picture out of symmetrical lines and it was not very colorful. Fancy site with a sleek design. Has a black background. Oh and you could put the design you made in the gallery and people could rate it out of 5 stars. Please help. Such a fun site :)
Ok its not really a math site its an art site lol

hmmmmmm.tough one
