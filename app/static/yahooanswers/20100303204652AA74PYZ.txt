is 16 m bps is the greatest speed of internet isn't...if yes then ok...if not then waht is it?
somebody ask me that waht is the..............???so please help me...

mine is 100mbps
16mbps is nothing compared to backbone speeds.
54MBS for wifi, 100MBS for LAN. 

With a T1 line etc. it gets a lot higher.
i have a wired modem with 100mpbs and 20/40mpbs wireless router . and yet the wireless gives more speed.. or is it just that my comp is old... lol oh well
I believe the highest internet speed is 1gigabyte per second. It was used by researchers in January 17 2008
There are two kinds of speed. One is called maximum speed which a wire or connection can support.
FYI a broadband can support a maximum speed of 100 mbps. But it works normally on 256 kbps.
which is downloading speed.So it depends on plan. If your scheme says You will get a speed of 16 mbps then it is so good. But don't get confused 100 mbps which is wire speed.
GRID system is the fastest
you cn download a movie in just 3 seconds......yes dats right just 3 sec ... imagine
