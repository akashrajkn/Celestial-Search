what is a good site that is free and dose not give a computer a virus to put music on your laptop?
please tell me i don't want to beg...PLEASE!!!...and please if you can list two... but if you only know one then list it please

limewire frostwire either wya you have to no what your looking for there isnt any sites without virus's these days
a legitimate website that'll probably charge you to download it.  viruses are the chance you take when you download music without paying...i guess nothing in life is truly free.
Limewire is crap.

Of course, you should not download music illegally, but in case you were writing a novel about a misleaded individual who might do so, here is what that individual would do:

1. Download a bittorrent downloader.  uTorrent is the best, it's free, very fast, very small, and contains absolutely no bloatware or advertisements.
2. Find torrents online.  One of the best websites to use for searching is www.thepiratebay.org
3. Be respectful to others, if you download 10MB, keep your uTorrent open until you've uploaded 10MB as well.
I recommend you a music site, it is easy to download and I can find almost all the music I want, you can have a try with it
