is poc mania a legit site?
someone just posted a question about and i clicked on it, so i was wondering if its legit and can you actually get prizes and how long will it take to get enough points for prizes? can you just tell me about it and if you have used it and what its like? i have wanted a laptop for a while and i saw that you can get one so i was wondering.
thanks in advance!

Yes it's legit, all you need other people to do is click on your link( It would be really helpful if you did below! Please and thanks) then you will gain 1 points every person that clicks. You can then earn a $20 gift card of your choice for 320 points, and $50+ cards. Also prizes
