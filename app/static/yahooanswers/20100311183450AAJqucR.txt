Crazy guy on eBay hints at hurting me, in my house. Advice/comments?
I bought a watch on eBay, it shipped and I got in time and everything, and I paid for it. However, I didnt give the guy feedback right away when I got it. He said that hurt his rep, and he will do something ''bad to you''(me). I didnt even talk to this dude, only bid, I left positive feedback about 9 hours later. Then he sent me crap about rep. Would you be scared, and why did I deserve this?
I left him positive feedback before he even sent this crap. He knew the local beach and roads, said he would use a golf club. I didnt even know he was crazy until this.

I personally think he's just trying to scare you. But if he DOES come to your house then of coarse you'll know what to do, call the cops!
Report him to ebay immediately! This is abuse whether he means it or not. Was this through your ebay messages or regular email? If it was through ebays messages I think there is a report button on that or contact ebays live help for assistance. 
You dont deserve this feedback is voluntary, not compulsory. I would not of let him intimidate me into leaving feedback. I would have reported him & eventually would have left him a negative FB for abuse.
Wonder how many others he has done this to?
