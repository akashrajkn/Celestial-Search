I am new to ebay. I found a deal that really does just seem far to good to be true. Please look (not spam!)?
first and formost, this is ***not*** something i'm selling; this is somthing i'm looking at buying. 99 times out of 100 when something is too good to be true, that is usually the case, and I just want to double check to see if that is the case here. Please see the link below

So far then no-one has bid on the item, and there's still 3 days left to go. What will almost certainly happen is there will be a large number of bids in the last day, and the eventual selling price will end up fairly normal.
There are 3 days left the price will go up, you can get ipod shuffle cheap on ebay
I buy a lot on ebay and have not had a bad experance. this is the bid price and you have to bid what you want to pay and hope nobody out bids you. Was that a help
Looks legit...I know it says "No Returns Accepted" but if it isn't a real Ipod when you get it then you can tell Ebay because the seller is advertising it as an actual Ipod. For example, my friend Justin once bought what was said to be a "real" Megan Fox full size...um...doll...but then all he got was a cardboard cut out. He told Ebay and they made the seller give him his money back. I think it really is legit though...go for it.
Well there can be chances on ebay and maybe the sellers new as well, but if it is only 99p you might as well buy it you never know!
Yes you are new to ebay.
This is an auction.
You will bid, others will bid, the highest bidder wins.
The bidding ends in on March 10, the auction closes and the highest bidder pays and receives.

Hey, look I am now the highest bidder at $0.99 + $4.99 Shipping for a total of $5.98.
If no one else bids, I win auction and pay $5.98.

Always look at the Shipping cost, always.
Shipping cost is one of the dirty little ebay secrets.
