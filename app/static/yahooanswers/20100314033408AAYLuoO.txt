How does one register for demonoid?


One gets invited.
You'll need to get invited. Google a bit for Demonoid invites or just search on YouTube. They often give away invites really fast
Demonoid is now open to the public for registrations so be quick.
If you're lucky enough to get in then you'll have to look out for an activation email that will be from gate_keeper and NOT Demonoid.
This can sometimes end up in your Spam folder so be sure to check there if you don't see it.
Please try and give back at least as much as you take so anything above 1.1 is always appreciated.
