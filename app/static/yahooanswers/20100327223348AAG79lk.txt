does chatroulette use a lot of internet?
just wondering how much internet it eats up.

Haha..um..what?
Internet is a renewable resource so I'm sure we have nothing to worry about...ha

Really, do you mean the bandwidth it takes? Because it has video, you'll probably want more than dial-up.
It uses a boat load of internet.
It uses hardly any bandwidth because it uses the latest adobe flash technology and since it's a p2p connection the only bandwidth is on initial site connections. There so keeping costs minimal.
