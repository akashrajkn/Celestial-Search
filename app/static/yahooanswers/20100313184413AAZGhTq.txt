I have Internet explorer 8 as a browser, and I am very satisfied with it, but flickr says I should try Mozilla?
Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing.  Hope someone who does can help me.
Is there any way I can keep my present browser and also have Mozilla?  Can I switch back and forth?  Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing, so I hope someone who does can help me.

Yeah. Mozilla Firefox is god compared to Internet Explorer.
Yep, Mozilla or Google Chrome. Internet Explorer is like using wadded up Kleenex inside Scotch Tape for Band-Aids.
Well, that's just an ad that FireFox (Mozilla) payed Filckr to say. But, you should be using Google Chrome because it's much faster than both of those on the exact same internet connection (proven fact).

edit:
If you install one, Internet Explorer will still be on your computer and you can still use it.
I'm a big fan of Mozilla Firefox.  I used Internet Explorer for years and now I can't imagine ever going back to it.

A general consensus is that when you take the step up from an internet tourist to someone who is actually an experienced internet user, you switch to Firefox.

When I worked in internet sales, I could immediately know if someone was an experienced internet user if I saw Firefox on their computer.

It's just more customizable and more user friendly in my opinion.  There are thousands of addons, some really good stuff like adblock, ways to customize how certain web pages show up for you, batches of tools for certain internet games if you play those, and I even have a news ticker at the top of my browser where current top news headlines scroll across the top of my screen.
You should give Firefox a try.
