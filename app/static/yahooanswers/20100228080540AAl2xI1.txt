How to fix this Internet Explorer issue?
Okay, so I downloaded Safari, when I used Internet Explorer. I didn't like Safari so I deleted it. When I reopened Internet Explorer, I had no add ons.There is still an annoying notice every time I open the internet telling me this. I just went on Youtube and I need something I had already installed a long time ago...well, I tried to but something is blocking the pop up to install it..so I can't download it. I also had tons of add ons that I really need...what to do :(

Firefox is loads better.  Free to download as well.
hold down the ctrl key when clicking on the download, this will unblock the popup
If you can restore back to a day before you installed safari, it might solve your problem. It depends on how long ago you installed safari.
