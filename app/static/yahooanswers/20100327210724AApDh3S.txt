How would I go about getting a business license for my website?
To be a little more specific, are there requirements, costs, and if I wanted to get one how would I do so.

contact your local court house they should be able to point you in the right direction.
Jordan,

Your state, county and borough websites will have the answer to this question.

In my state, the state requires a business license, and my city just requires that I register my business name with them.

Let me know if you need any more specifics.
