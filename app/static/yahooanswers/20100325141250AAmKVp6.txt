Does anyone know a way to get help paying for prescription meds?
Ok so I have great insurance right now but it is going to run out in a few months. I'm currently a military spouse but unfortunately my husband and I have grown apart and are in an unhealthy relationship; we have decided to get a divorce. I have about 5 months left on his insurance but after that, I don't know how I'm going to afford dr. visits or prescription meds. The main problem is that I'm Bipolar. I know there are ways people with behavioral health problems get help paying for meds but I can't find out where they're getting help. My meds (without insurance) are about $700-$800/month and if I can't pay for the meds I'm going to become really sick. Does anyone have any suggestions about cheap health insurance or a way to get help paying for my meds?
