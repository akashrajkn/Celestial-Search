Is there anyway to limit searches (trending topics,etc.) to just followers instead of ALL of Twitter users?
Every time I type something into the search box on Twitter, ALL of Twitter users come up talking about that something where I just want to see what my friends (followers) think. It gets annoying really. 

Is it possible?
