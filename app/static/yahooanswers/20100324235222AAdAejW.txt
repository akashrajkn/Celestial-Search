Is anyone here using jumbofiles.com to host files?
I came across this file hosting website called jumbofiles which is similar to rapidshare. It has no such download restrictions as rapidshare and allows you to upload upto 500GB with a single free account with a maximum of 1GB per file. 

That's just incredible compared to other file hosting websites but there is very little information on this website on the internet. Is it reliable? How long has it been operating? Does it go down often?

Any information will be helpful. Thank You.

I like Live Drive better. http://bestfilehosting.org says that it gives unlimited space.
