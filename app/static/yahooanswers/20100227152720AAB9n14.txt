Is downloading a Windows torrent very dangerous?
I know the dangers of Viruses ect.
But legally is downloading Windows very risky?
One time I downloaded Windows XP, and then got a letter in the mail from my ISP, have me call, they said to remove it from my computer. That's it though.
Because I reallyyyy need to recover my computer's Windows Vista!

Stay away from torrents. They are extremely dangerous. Anything that has to do with P2P is unsafe.
That's a really bad idea.

It's one thing to illegally download an Atari 2600 game; you're unlikely to anger anybody by doing that (of course, you still shouldn't do it though). It's yet another thing to download something that's actually still commercially available *today*. Moreover, Windows is the most popular OS in the world, so that's a really bad choice of software to illegally download. 

You can actually walk into some stores and buy Windows Vista today. That's a really bad sign. You can't walk into a store and buy Windows 3.1. If you were asking about the safety of illegally downloading Windows 3.1, I would say that it's probably low (still inadvisable though, of course).
Go get PeerBlock or PeerGuardian. Those will block your IP number so there will be less of a chance of you getting into trouble. If your ISP has to keep sending you emails or letters, then you might get your internet account suspended.
who said so it's leagal
