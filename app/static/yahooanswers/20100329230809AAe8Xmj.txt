Did you know Snapvine is shutting down on march 31st?
and how the hell am I going to save my sh*t?
*sighs* this is coming from half a lounge act../

Hi 
how about skype its only a software program according to the information, like Myspace.
Snapvine??? Didn't that go out with Windows 95 and parachute pants?  

I bet you still listen to MC Hammer and drive a Trans Am, don't you?
I feel weird answering a question. Not sure I know how to anymore....

ummm

um

no. I didnt know.  But now I do
Yay,  It's Nubsy on an Irky Q and welcome to answers UK, we can say SHlT all day long here on Answers UK
Seems logical to save it in a nappy bag then!
I agree with Nubs.
She ain't no ninja Answerer anymore, that's for darn sure!

*runs away and hides from the ninja*
wtf is snapvine? Does it have anything to do with the emancipation of negros?
aw... i wouln't say it was ALL sh*t, 'Irked One'!!

Just ask Lu... she knows about these things :)
I did and you can only save your voice blog. The only way to save the messages is to play them while having a sound recorder program running. That would take forever.
Yes i do :( of course you abounded mulity so you didn't see my post  :P

Sil is saving our stuff..
Well I didn't know it before, but I do now.  Now I'm going to lose all those snappies that you sent to me.......oh wait, you never cared enough to send me any.   :(
hmmm ... I fear it may be too late ... I heard all that Snapvine 
stuff is going to the big mulch pile in the corner.
NO
You should have looked on the site, it told you how to save voice blogs. But it's too late now, sorry.
