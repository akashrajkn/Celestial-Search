Is there a program that will let me update my MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter?
I have accounts with all of them and I normally update my statuses via mobile phone. I just wanted to know if there was a program that will let me do that via computer :D 

I heard about TweetDeck but I haven't tried it yet. Any ideas :) Thanks!

Try going to the websites and doing it that way.... If youre at school/work and you need to get around a firewall blocker then you should try www.atproxy.net or www.camolist.com
