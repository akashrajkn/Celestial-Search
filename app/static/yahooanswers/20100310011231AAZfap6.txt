Does anyone know a blogging site similar to windows live?
On windows live you can do a blog. Somehow. I am not sure how exactly it works, and I don't particularly want to know. What I do want to know is if anyone knows a (writing) blog space with a similar format to that? I can't do it on windows live because...well, people know me on there.

Wordpress

I suggest you blogspote.com site.
I think rather than windows live, you should consider blogger.com. For the following reasons:

If begin a beginner to blogging your idea is to decide which blogging platform you should use; so that you don't have to be disappointed with your platform choice; Then let I assure you, Blogger.com, a blogging platform by Google is by far the best.

Blogger.com is the best platform for all bloggers, irrespective of their tech expertise. In addition, another benefit of using blogger is that you get traffic from Google search as well. 

Google's blogger.com is a pretty versatile blogging platform. The url format of your new blog will be xyz.blogspot.com, where xyz represents your name. But if you want to make the url look xyz.com, blogger allows you to do that as well. You can tweak the looks of your blog, from 1 percent to 100 percent and add much functionality to it as well.

For beginner, getting started is quite easy too, just three steps:

Create an account (if you have an existing gmail account, then you can use that too)
Name your blog
Choose a template

For the time being you just create a new blogger blog and get started.
