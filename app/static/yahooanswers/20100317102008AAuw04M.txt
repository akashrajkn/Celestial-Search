what policy did ebay make that drove away a lot of their users?
i just read this in the youtube forum on the subject of the unpopular new format changes on youtube ,  this guy  mentioned   this in passing  about ebay :


''  I used to spend a lot of time on Ebay... in their desperate search for more money they made policy changes that drove away huge amounts of their CORE users. I guess GoogleTube wants to make that exact same mistake    ''


as an ebay member i just want to know.  what were the details of  these unpopular policy changes  that  drove  away a lot of ebay users ?


ive not visited ebay for a long time, this is why im asking.

the most unpopular in the last few years was taking away the ability of sellers to leave feedback for buyers. Many folks felt betrayed by this as buyers can take much more advantage of sellers than they used to and hold feedback over their head.

the other was an inconsistency in valuing auction style listings over store listings and going back and forth. They have changed up and down which gets better placement on the site as well as what the costs are. At one point they took store listings out of search so those folks with huge stores got really angry and left either for Amazon or their own sites. 

I will stay with ebay as I like it and enjoy my customers.
EBay works on a flat rate, plus a percentage of the sale.

A few years ago, eBay squeezed their 'store owners' with higher listing fees. Some of them were already working on small profit margins and the additional 4$ in shipping fees per order took thousands away from some people.
