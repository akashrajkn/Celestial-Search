why does my internet keep opening new windows?
I will just be sitting on the internet then all these internets start popping up and its sooo annoying!
does anyone know what it could be?
I am mostly on myspace could that be related to it?

thankyou if anyone can help it will mean so much :)

Sound like pop-ups. Could have gotten a simple ad-ware where it just keep showing up ads. Do a simple virus scan.
It could either be that your pop-up blocker is disabled, or you may have a virus or trojan on your machine. Download MalWareBytes:

Because some of those windows has been closed.
maybe since ur on myspace they usually have a lot of ads so maybe they pop up and are blank sometimes that happens and if that's not the case then u have a virus in your computer.hope this helped:)god bless and good luck!:D
