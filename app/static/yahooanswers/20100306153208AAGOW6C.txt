Why do all of the Lockerz prizes say "More Soon?"?
I am curious to why this is. It is not because the lack of points. I currently have 16 PTZ and a prize that is 15 PTZ still says "More Soon." What does that mean?

I am a member of lockerz and this is because they have redemptions.. redemptions and days when they restock. They restock usually twice a month. When they restock they will notify you. Warning: The site may be very laggy during redemptions.
Lockerz is a scam...
It means that lockerz is a scam.  Nobody ever gets redemptions.  Some of my friends have been waiting months with tonnes of points and they went through several redemptions and never got anything.  They said stuff would show up as available and then suddenly be out of stock, but that no one ever got anything.

That site is a scam.
Unlike what other people said, the site ISN'T a scam, you just have to be smart and you have to be there at the right time. If you want to get an item, you have to constantly refresh a page during on of the redemption days until the thing that you want becomes available. As soon as it does, just click "Redeem Now", and you will receive an email as soon as they ship it out. 

I repeat again that this isn't a scam. There are just a lot of idiots using the website that don't know s*** about it!
Items run out of stock real quick. They choose a random date for the redemption's I suggest you to use LockerzAlerts - http://www.lockerzalerts.com  service , they will send you text message to your mobile phone when the redemption occurs ! its also FREE !
