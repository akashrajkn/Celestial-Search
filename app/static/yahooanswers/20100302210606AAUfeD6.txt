Legitimate screen-saver sites?
Legitimate screen-saver sites? I don't care if they are ones you pay for as long as they have a good selection. Like 3D fishes, hot air balloons, running waterfalls or I donno, anything but the boring windows ones xp, vista and 7 all suck. Need to find a good site without viruses and a ton of malware.

visit ...www.likediss.blogspot.com  really it is a good site for free
Webshots, Fun Utilities, Desktop Nexus
They have some free ones here. Not the best ones I've seen, but they have no malware or other junk in them.
