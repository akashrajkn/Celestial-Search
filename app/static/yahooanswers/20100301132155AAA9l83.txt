What's the best? Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or IE?
I was just wondering, I used to be a firefox user, now I have become pretty fond of Google Chrome, and I was just wondering, whats the most used, fastest, and all around best?

im using safari never had a single problem
Chrome Chrome Chrome Chrome Chrome Chrome.
Chrome
FIREFOX 4 LIFE
IE is the most used and the best, being as its written for windows. FireFox closely follows. I have never had a problem with then new IE8, (or IE7 for that matter.) I would say safari is the worst browser out there, for the simple reason of it was written by a company who don't understand windows, and leave a dozen security holes in there own OS, so why wouldn't they with there Internet browser. 

If you're after the fastest, chromes meant to be that, but I've always found IE adequte enough for my needs.
i love google chrome. its faster than the rest of them, im my opinon
