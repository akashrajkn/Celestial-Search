Is there anyway I can earn money on the internet and get it payed into my paypal?
I'm only 15 and I want some money in my paypal.

Sell stuff or make up a crazy story into conning people to use your "donate" button.
Try getting into web design, or getting good with GIMP or Photoshop and making banners and other graphics.
If you have a credit card, you could try setting up a website and placing ads. If you don't have one, try talking with your parents about money from your site getting transferred into your bank.
If you have products that are legal to sell there is ebay & ioffer, and kijijii
It is called file hosting. Have files that people want. They download them and you get payed for each download. It is only a few cents a download but if you have enough people downloading it then it adds up. The various sites are http://www.hotfile.com     http://www.rapidshare.com   http://www.depositfiles.com   etc.

The trick is finding files that people want to download and finding those files.
Go to affiliates.amazon.com
sign up or sign in with ur amazon.com account
put ads onto ur website
when people buy from the Ads you get 4-6% of the cost of the product
OR you can put a search box on your website and ask relatives to search for their products their and u also get 4% but more people buy

The fastest and easiest way to get money for your paypal is to start doing market research, which means becoming a consumer consultant and getting paid for your opinions. Many market research companies have panels specifically for teens, and you fit right into that category. So, on my blog, I have a list of market research companies that I am a member of, and all have paid me very nicely, I also have tips that others are scared to give. These are legit companies that will pay you, either via check or paypal. I make anywhere from $150 to $300 plus a month for just a few hours of my time. Just check it out for yourself and then decide. I have done all the work, research, checked them out with the BBB, read reviews before joining, and they are all legit. Here is a link to my blog, and best of luck to you. http://piper-of-pipers-lair-blog.blogspot.com/
