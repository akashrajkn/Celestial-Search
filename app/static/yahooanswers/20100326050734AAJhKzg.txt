Why are torrents legal?
What use is there of torrents that is actually legal?

You can get Public Domain torrents (legal) but copyrighted Music/Movies/Software are illegal yes.  You can find some cool stuff on Public Domain torrent sites.
People can use these to share documents and the like.  Even Microsoft used torrents to get some their beta's to the public.
Torrents are just a technology.  You might as well ask why email or browsers are legal.

It's what people do with the technology that may or may not be legal.  There are lots of legitimate reasons for moving large amounts of data around.
It is not why, it is when.

Torrents can be legal if they are used to share public domain items - this is software, pictures, music, movies, etc. that are not protected by copyrights. They can be legal when used to share items that you download and then pay to use.

Problem is that much of torrent use is to provide access to non-public domain items and the downloaders don't pay anything for them. Basically, stealing electronically.

On their own, torrents are not illegal. It is what is put in the torrent and how the end user consumes the torrent that makes the action illegal.
