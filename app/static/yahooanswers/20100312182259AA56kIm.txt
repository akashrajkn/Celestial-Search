If my landlord has Direct TV/AT&T can I get Time Warner Cable internet?
So basically, the house I'm renting a room in has DirecTV cable and AT&T for an internet service provider.  But, I want to get Time Warner Cable internet in my room.  Would this be at all possible? Thanks for any help!

If the service is available there, technically you could. But if they have to do any additional line installation, the owner may not approve.
Check your lease and ask the landlord. We can't give you more advice than that.

Hope that helps.
