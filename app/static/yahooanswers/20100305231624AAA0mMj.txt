if you use a psp for the internet using your home wireless internet....?
would your parents be able to find out any of your internet history?? if you have only used it on your psp but through your family wireless router?/?

Nope. My brother uses his psp all the time and I can never see his history. And he uses the family wireless router as wll. You kno you can also set up a password for your internet, so no one can go on it and check your history. Hope I helped ;)
