Getting a PSP Wireless Connection?
Is there anyway i can get a wireless connection at my home on my PSP, if i don't have a router?

You need a wireless internet connection to access the net on your PSP.
yeah....sure but u must have wifi connceions...in your nearby area....if ur neighbours have wifi conncetion u ask dem for it .......or u have to hack it.......


nearby offices will most probably havin wifi conncetions try hacking dat

first of all turn on your psp and scan for wifi connections
