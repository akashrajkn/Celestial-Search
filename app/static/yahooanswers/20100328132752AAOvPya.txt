Here is a free movie website - en.3ds3ds.com
Hi,

You can try http://www.clicktomore.info/movies

This site is legal, quick, has no bandwidth restrictions and hosts movies on its own server (not p2p). It is quite a good movie site IMO. The one great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of movies you get, so you essentially can grow a ravenous movie collection if you want! (=

Hope This helps!

Its not free though, but considering the great number of movies you can get from the site, if you divide the cost to the number of movies you can get there, it really feels as though all you get there is free! Maybe its like 3 cents per movie or something?
