Alternative browsers other than the IE or Firefox ?
I have been using Firefox about 90% of the time...within the last 3 days I have had alot of trouble getting this browser to come up on the screen..or it would say...the page is just been reset...try again ....now when i do get on Firefox and try to go back to the home page...it won't do it...so i end up clicking off...and then clicking back on.....I have done scans of all folders with Anti-virus, anti-malware and Spyware...and they all come up clean.....Need a suggestion on a Browser comprable to Firefox which is just as safe ......and please don't tell me to uninstall and re-install...all files and folders are working fine....just need another Browser to work with....Any Suggestions ??

Google Chrome
Google Chrome, Opera, Safari (For Mac & PC)
FireFox is under constant maintenance....that is the reason why all you listed problems are coming up...
Anyways....browsers like Opera and Chrome are good...Safari has also been a good option...After IE and Firefox..Opera Chrome and Safari are the best remaining options...
Still firefox is under way...once the maintenance part is over it will regain its glory.....and ya in some time IE 9 is also coming up..do check that out too!!!
