I NEED HELP ON FORMSPRING?
Okay, so yesterday i made a formspring account but i've gone and aleady forgetten my password!!
I tried guessing it then clicked reset and then i typed in my name and it said they have sent me an email so i can reset it.

Tried AGAIN.
No email.
I checked my junk, no email.
What do you think is wrongg?

The same thing happened to me, but I had set it up with Face book as well, So if you go onto the log in page, you can hit sign in with face book and if that helps I hope it does.
