Chat Roulette Website Down?
Anyone else having problems using www.chatroulette.com I know the site now has around 50,000 online, or has the website crashed due to high demand?

PING says that it is up, they may possibly be doing maintenance or your comp may be screwing up.
it was working for me like 30 mins ago now its down
Down for me too.
http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ confirms it's down for everyone.

I have no idea why; I just found out about it and tried to see what this is. Is it down frequently?
Yea its down today for me to it also says on the site that their replacing servers and it says it will all be fixed in 20 hours
Someone mentioned downforev... But that's a heck of a lot to type each time you want to see if a website is down.

The short version is http://checkw.com/

In this particular case, use the link http://checkw.com/www.chatroulette.com or go to the main page and type in www.chatroulette.com

CheckW says its online now, and I can see it is up myself, so it is accurate.

Good luck ;)
