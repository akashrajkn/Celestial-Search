why does Firefox keep redirecting me to myspace or facebook?
everytime i open a new tab from google search, it leads to myspace of facebook or something else and i have to close it and re-open the link 

is it a virus?

:/

Aww, poor Sora-chan. I had a similar problem recently, where I click a link and it redirects me to some other website. :-(
I found out that it was a hijacker virus. I was worried since it was my first time removing a virus all by myself. But I finally erased it!

In my case, it didn't redirect me to MySpace or Facebook, but just to some spam site. But I used this program called Malwarebytes. It really works when removing viruses and stuff. Here's the site to download it:
http://malwarebytes.org/
Just click "Download free version."

When you finish downloading it,

1) Open the program.
2) Click Perform Full Scan. It's best to close out all programs that are running, including this Firefox page.
3) Now wait... a very long time, sadly.
4) When it's finished, it should tell you how many objects are infected. Click Show Results, and it should lead you to the Quarantine tab.
5) Select them all (if they are not selected already), and click Delete All. All the viruses should be gone.

By the way, a notepad might pop up during the time. It's just a log, so don't worry about it.

If you don't have one already, I recommend you get a anti-virus software. I have McAfee now, and it's pretty good. But you have to pay for it... >_>

Well, I hope this helps! Sorry if I spoke too "technical." >.< 
If you need more help, just Email me! :D
Good luck!
