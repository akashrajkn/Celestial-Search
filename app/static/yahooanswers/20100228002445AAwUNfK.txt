I'm looking for a website where I can...?
I want to a scrapbook that I can make online, and have sent to me as a hard cover book. BUT  I want complete control over the background, where to put text and where to put my pictures. None of this pre-layout stuff that most sites have that come up on google. I'd really appreciate if anyone knows of a site like this. Thanks!

Try Shutterfly. You have to sign up but it looks fairly easy to use and has more options than your usual Custom Creators.

This website provides a pretty good software for "make wonderful digital scrapbook" (but it is a downlad tool), which i have used for a long time, and it always works great~~ 
And you can free use for 30 days!
Hope it helps x.
