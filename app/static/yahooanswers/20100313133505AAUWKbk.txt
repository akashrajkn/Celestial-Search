twitter or face book?
my sister wants to know which is better
i also forgot to mention what about myspace

facebook. i have both and i think twitter is a bit silly unless you NEED to know what a celebrity is doing every second of the day. otherwise you can just text your friends instead of tweet.
Facebook because it has the status updates of twitter+the groups, apps, etc.  Facebook is also better because a lot more people use it.  One thing that makes twitter better is that you can get mobile text message updates from your friends.
