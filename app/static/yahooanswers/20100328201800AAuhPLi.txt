How can i find my internet history?
Can you find your internet history, on a windows pc using internet explorer, after the history was cleared, cookies were deleted, and temp folders were removed? if you can, is it possible to completely clear it? thanks

go here download and install the recovery software
If you're leaving your current workplace, the only other thing you could do(just to be safe side that all your files have been deleted) is to kill all the dudes in the i.t dept. (tape them up , chuck them in the car boot and drive car over cliff)
If you're paranoid that your partner might find something that you don't want them to find out, tape em up and bury em alive, under the house.
Once the temporary folders are deleted, it's nearly impossible to find the prior web sites. The authorities can do it with their software, but unless you have a few grand to drop for this type of software, you're out of luck. There is one software you can try, but it usually doesn't work for temps. Good luck!
