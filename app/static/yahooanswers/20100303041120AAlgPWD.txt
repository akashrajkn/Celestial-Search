Websites often have 'assets' that are delivered using unencrypted techniques.
Quite often, they are advertising, from 3rd parties not related directly to the site you've asked your browser to go to.
Not a real big issue, but your browser is notifying you that the condition exists.
This mild warning can be disabled in browser tools, security warnings, if you feel comfortable using 'https' and all it implies.
do you have ssl 2.0 or ssl 3.0 enabled
