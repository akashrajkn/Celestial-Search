why was my Twitter account deleted? any ideas?
i do spout out my fair share of rude opinions, but it's not like i was a porn bot or anything ... i just tried to log on today and it was gone ... no explanation, no email, no nothing ... i've been on for a long time with over 3500 tweets ... will they respond to my emails to even tell me why they did that?

They're deleting all accounts of people who say "I'm cooking food in the microwave." *tweet* "There are three seconds left." *tweet* "Now one..." *tweet* "I am taking my first bite." *tweet* etc.
If you violated the rules, your account is gone, period!
