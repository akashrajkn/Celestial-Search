How to disable downloading from email?
Ok... so i have this picture of my gf and her best friend kissing... and the best friend contacted me to send her the picture.. but i think the reason for her asking is to show someone else the picture, although she says it isn't. I believe that since its mine no one else but us 3 should see it. and since she is in the picture im thinking about giving her a copy as long as she doesn't show it to her boyfriend. and to be sure she doesn'tt do that i was wondering if its possible to block the picture from being downloaded if i send it to her through email? i know you can disable the right click but is it possible to disable it on email? oh yeah and you know how Gmail has a download link on emails containing pictures, is it possible to disable that link also?

If you don't want them having them the picture, then don't send it.
