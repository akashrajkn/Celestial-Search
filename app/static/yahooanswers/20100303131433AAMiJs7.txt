Why does the last update in firefox read from 1969?
shows dec 31 1060 when I check the update status in tools>options>advanced>show update history for updates 16,17 and 18. Is this Firefox or windows XP fault?

January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UDT (the time in London) is the time many computer dates are calculated from, where a number is the number of seconds from this time. So this particular time is the timestamp 0.

So December 31, 1969 is what day it was for time 0 in timezones west of London. Because of this, if software uses a date that is not defined, it is interpreted as 0, and therefor shown as December 31, 1969.

So basically, the Firefox update didn't specify the timestamp correctly, and so the time showed up way in the past.
