I accidentally downloaded a toolbar for Safari that I don't want. How do I delete it?


use firefox, it pwnes safari big-time, otherwise, google it!
If you are useing firefox you can go to "tools" then click "add=ons" then find the safari add on in the Extensions or plugins tab, and just uninstall it. Safari can not be much different. also switch to Firefox.. much better
if you have windows then go to windows defender, then go to tools, then click on software explorer, and look for the toolbar and uninstall it.
Firefox is much better and much safer.  Uninstall safari
To simply hide it from view, go to the top of the page and click on "View."  On the drop-down menu, click on "Toolbars."  Uncheck the ones you don't want to see by clicking on the checkmark beside them.
