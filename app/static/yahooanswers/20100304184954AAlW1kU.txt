It's really better to post your own content to get a feel for what it's like.

That way when your outsourcers has a question you can answer it with authority.

...don't be so lazy and blog for yourself for awhile first...

I agree with Lisa, outsourcing comes much later. First you must create useful content yourself. If your current blog is about something you're not passionate about then choose some other topic you have passion for. Try to focus on spreading the word first, the more people know about your blog better, and don't be bothered about revenue. In a blog's life cycle, revenue from ads comes after a readership is created. Use Traffic Exchangers to spread the word. Work actively on Social networking too.
