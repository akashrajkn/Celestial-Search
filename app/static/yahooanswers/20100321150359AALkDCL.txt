Should I stick to firefox or switch to chrome?


I'm a personal fan or firefox so firefox all the way :)
I would say switch to Internet Explorer. Lot's of people say Internet Explorer is awful, but version 8 actually has a lot of features, is faster, and even one first place in a NSS lab study on security! http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Internet+Explorer+8+NSS&l=1

For more information on what people say that's bad about Internet Explorer 8, check this out: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/get-the-facts/mythbusting.aspx

If you don't know if you have Internet Explorer 8, watch my how-to video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3mA3esXZg&fmt=18
I Have The Main 3 Internets - I Never Use INTERNET Exsplour - I Always Use GOOGLE Chrome - Its Better, It Opens Faster, Has Options To Open The Tabs You Closed Last, Easy Bookmark Under Search And Its Simple To use, And Search Faster, Firefox is slow for me, and i dont like it at all
