Have you ever made a really good friend on Omegle?
Like you talked to them for ages and then you added them on facebook or MSN and now you're really good friends.

Just curious :)

I've talked to a couple on msn. But only once have I added them on Facebook. Then it was funny because it turns out they live only 20 minutes from me haha.
