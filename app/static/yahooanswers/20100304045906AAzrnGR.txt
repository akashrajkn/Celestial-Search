I have found the Google Translator to work very well:
http://translate.google.com/#

It offers a large number of languages and for the languages that I know, the translation are quite accurate. I love their swap languages feature. If you are trying to get Spanish to English translation, keep 'from' as English, choose 'into' as Spanish and click on the swap button.

The best part is that it translates while you type. Of course, you can cut and paste a large block of text and get the whole thing translated in one shot.

You can use the babylon for this purpose. It's the best translator in my opinion:
