how can I retrieve deleted email?
my provider is yahoo and I accidentally deleted an email I wanted to save which is very important for my work,,,help please!

You can see that in ur Trash
If you deleted it completely, including from the trash, then you can't retrieve it again. You need to have the e-mail sent to you again. Sorry.
look in your trash, or MAYBE your my computer, you might get from " Rover " the search dog, at search on your start up page.
