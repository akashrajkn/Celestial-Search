Is redtube a safe virus free site?
if i were to just watch videos will i get a virus/spyware
thanks for not being rude i appreciate it

You won't get viruses, but pornhub is way better.
Aslong as you dont download anything, then any website is pretty much safe.
Yup perfectly safe. Have a happy "personal time"
it great has no virus 
just don't go all crazy clicking on the ads
yes it is, yes it is...
You can use SpywareNoMore. 
As we all know Computer hackers seeking financial gain rather than thrills or notoriety are increasingly flooding the Internet with malicious software code (spyware, adware, key loggers, trojans). They are infecting computers with highly sophisticated programs that record surfing habits, bank passwords and other key financial data and send them to crooks over the Internet. These programs can be hard to spot, disguised in downloads such as toolbars, search engines, browser accessories, screen savers and other seemingly helpful utilities.

SpyNoMore anti-spyware safeguards your identity and restores system performance through fast, smart and powerful spyware protection.
