How can I find my downloads in Internet Explorer 8?
I need to find the website where I downloaded something from and I can't find the download tab/window in Internet Explorer 8.

Websites you've visited are usually stored in History, unless you're paranoid and delete it every time you log off.

Otherwise, IE8 doesn't keep track of downloads like Firefox and some other browsers do. You might as well just ask where to find what you downloaded before.
unless you or your settings ran a cleanup you can open (click the star) favorites under History (Tab).
