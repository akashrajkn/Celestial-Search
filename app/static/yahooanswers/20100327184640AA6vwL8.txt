How do i Access my Router through a web browser? (it doesn't load)?
Yesterday, i could easily go onto my web browser and type my IP address into the URL bar and i could access my ports and other details (i have linksys router). but today, everytime i try to go on it through my browser it says "Problem Loading page" another detail i ahve to add is that when i logged onto my computer this morning, it gave me a message saying "another computer has the same IP address as you" and other things. after that i couldn't get on. is there anyway to fix that?

This can happen because of too much trafficking through the router. Resetting the router is your best option. (On the back there should be a little hole with "reset" next to it. Press that and hold it down for 10 seconds.) If you don't already have a password on it, put one on. Some outsider might be accessing it. Hope you problem is solved!
Power cycle your router. Unplug the power from the router and wait 2 mins. Plug it back in and wait 1 min. Reconnect computers. Mines does the same thing from time to time.
