How long would the internet continue to work if everyone died?
Just wondering if most or all of the people in the world died how long would the internet continue to work?
Its for a short story I'm writing I was just curious cuz I have no idea. Also an unrelated note: Thank you very much mike, the world needs its assholes who make unneeded comments like that. What would we do without you ;)

The internet is eternal.
It will still work till the power goes out
Well..... considering the internet doesn't technically need people to run, it would probably last a long long long time. Although, if no one was alive, the internet would run into many problems and bugs, but no one would be here to fix them. Also, no one would know how long it would last b/c no one is alive. Btw, i like the question, very deep...
interesting question.  The answer is we can never know, because there wouldnt be anyone in the world to check.
If everyone in the world died. I wonder then who would pay our internet service provider. But, wait, if that were to happen there wouldn't be no need for internet.
The better question to ask is how long would the power stations run without human supervision?

The internet would stop the instant everyone on the Earth died. The internet is more an idea than an electronic network. Without people to produce, surf, write email, and answer Yahoo questions, the internet would instantly pause forever till the power went out and then it would be gone forever.

This was a pretty depressing question, you want someone to talk to Gabe? Email me.
Without people, the internet would cease working immediately.
this is just a variation on the old "if a tree falls in the forest ..." question.

Jared has it right, It will work until all the power goes out
