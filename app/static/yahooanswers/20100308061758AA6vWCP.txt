Is it possible on aol mail to set it up so that you have a copy of sent e-mails like you can in Yahoo?
I don't see that as an option when I go to settings.
keeping tabs.

My friend with all due respect AOL still uses mail AOL is still around i bet u have alot of ad aware. Please upgrade ur service use GMAIL so much better then yahoo or AOL.
