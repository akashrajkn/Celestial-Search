I am missing a back button on firefox.How can i get it back?
I seem to be missing some sort of toolbar on firefox.I might have turned it off by accident.I dont have a back button on display on firefox.How do i get it back?

either hit F11 or reinstall firefox, i suggest using google chrome though
Go to View/Toolbars and make sure "Navigation Toolbar" is selected.

If there is still no back button....right click on one of the other buttons, choose "Customise", find the back button, drag and drop it to the navigation toolbar then click "Done".
Try looking under Tools: Options to see if theres anything there.  Or try downloading it again.
Follow the instructions Arther gives. His is the correct answer. Also, Chrome sucks! lol
