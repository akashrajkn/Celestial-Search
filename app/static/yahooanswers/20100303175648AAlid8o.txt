Question about finding music online?
Hi! 
What's a website where you can find music (legally) and download it to an iPod?
A website where people can also upload their own music for others to download, as well. 

Thanks!

iTunes music store lets you buy music if you have a credit card number. It's legal but costs money, and the musicians see some of the money which is good.
