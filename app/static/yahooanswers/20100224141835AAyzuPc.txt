Is there a website where you can get a penpal?
It has to safe and it has to be by email any websites??????? Thanks :)

The term penpal generally refers to communication by actual mail rather than e-mail.
I communicate with a dozen or so of my MySpace friends by e-mail and another half dozen or so by phone.  These are people I did not know prior to MySpace
