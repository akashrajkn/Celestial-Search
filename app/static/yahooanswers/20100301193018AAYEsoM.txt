question about twitter?
is it just like myspace and facebook? e.g.  can you add your friends, join groups, play games etc?

No. It's just like status updates.
Nope, you can only follow people, befriend them and micro-blog.
Only 140 characters to update your status in short sentence. You can follow some friends but there are not groups.
No. You can follow people which is almost like add friends. You can post videos, photos, its specially fun when you have a mobile because you can take pictures and tell people where you are. 
I do it on my Sidekick. You just have to have a good modern pgone like blackberry, iPhone, Sidekick, etc.
I like it.
