selling tobacco online...?!?!?!?!?
ok so I am thinking of opening a hookah/shisha website to sell my hookahs. I also want to sell flavored tobacco for the hookahs.. i just don't know what kind of license i would need.. do i need 1 license? or a license for each state???

Yes, I 'm pretty sure you need a license because a police could put you in jail!
You would need a federal tax id number to be registered as a business entity. You would only need a license for each state if you wholesale your hookahs to companies/other businesses, but to sell to an individual or the in-user you will only need a business license for your state.
