Internet help!!?? How do i.....?
Kay so i have Windows nternet Explorer and every time i type in a address it shows the history of that site and is there any way to stop that cuz i don't want it to show the history??!!

That's an easy one lol well... when you open up internet explorer go to tools, then internet options. After internet options click on the content tab. Then you will see a section that says autocomplete. Click the settings button within that section. From there you can check and uncheck what every you like lol

Breakdown:
internet explorer>tools>internet options>content tab>autocomplete(settings)>uncheck like crazy.
