It is so difficult that many early players would defy death, leaping from the 4th rock and hoping to land on the 6th! But when you are on the 5th rock, wait until both the 5th and 6th are moving down quickly. When you jump, the 6th rock will fall under you!
Wiki!
On the Fire Planet, jump from rock to rock as they are lifted and dropped by the geysers. Jump when the next rock is below you, even when you can't see it. For the 6th rock, jump when both rocks are moving downward.
