if you know someon's twitter name can you know their email?
Sorry if this is a stupid question. Just curious

Usually it's just a screenname, not necessarily their email address. Twitter has options specifically to hide your email address, so it's doubtful you can find it out through there.
no.email will not be publicly displayed.they mention it under email address on the settings.
Nope. unless they tell u "hey my twitter username and email are the same"
