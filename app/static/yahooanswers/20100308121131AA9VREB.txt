how to get rid of comcast navigation toolbar from my mac firefox?
because their navigation toolbar really sucks and never return anything searchable at all.

Look at the main menu. Click View. There should be a toolbar selection there. Click that and deselect the toolbar you don't want to see. If you click add-ons on the tools menu, you should find a way to remove it.
