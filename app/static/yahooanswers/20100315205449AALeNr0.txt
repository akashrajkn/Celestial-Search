How can I get more followers on Tumblr?
I just made my Tumblr blog and I'm still trying to get how to use everything. I'm posting pictures and reblogging like crazy, and I'm following a lot of people, but I still have only 10 followers. Any tips on how I can get more? Plz and thanks! :D

Follow for a Follow... If you post enough of these questions on the net you'll get people like me that Follow for a Follow.
if you follow people, a lot of them will follow back
and you have to post stuff that would be interesting to your followers so they'll reblog it.

follow me, reblog me

I think it just depends on your posts. if people liked it, im sure they will follow you.
