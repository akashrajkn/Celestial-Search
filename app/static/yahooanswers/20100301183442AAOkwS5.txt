what about twitter...?
do you like? i have one with my friend. mostly we spam it with song and movie quotes. and the only people we really follow are people in bands and some others. i don't really get what makes it so amazing, but its fun.
so why do you like twitter?
i so totally agree! i don't give a sh*t what your doing. i like it to be worth while. at least quotes make you look something up if you want to have an idea what they are talking about

personally i don't like twitter, because noone what your  doing or what im doing. I mean its like, im eating cereal, im hacking your moms myspace, seriously i dont really care what your doing (not you personally).
