Does .info domains matter in Search engine rankings? (SEO)?
I plan to buy several .info domains because it is on sale on Godaddy for only $1.. Will it matter on my search engine? Is it really advantageous to use .coms or .info is fine.. I am hoping for some answers..i would appreciate it a lot..

Ill be honest. It ALL depends on content and SEO you apply. If Google likes your page and is relevant to your SEO keyword, it is the same thing. 

Some people will say that its better to buy com. And well, they might be right. 

But the fact that I can go out and do the same thing with 1$ .info domain than a 14$ .com domain, well you see my point. Its all about your work in the end. Now think what you want:
.com= true, this normally means higher chances to rank good
.info=WAY cheaper and if you know how to do it, its the same as a .com
Don¡¯t trust any cheap service, many of them don¡¯t allow you to have full control on your domain name. If you¡¯re going to buy domain names,  refer to:

As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com).  To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
