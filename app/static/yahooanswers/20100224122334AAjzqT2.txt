A question about lockerz!! go on click if you think you're hard enough !?
well i just wanna ask to anyone who might know. i have made it to z lister but i was just wondering since about 9 of the emails i used i made myself. will i still get the t-shirt even though they're all from the same ip adress

idk but i have sent 80 fake email and the points are there =P so they should send the shirt though i am preety sure they have stopped sending them out due to the amount of people joining
