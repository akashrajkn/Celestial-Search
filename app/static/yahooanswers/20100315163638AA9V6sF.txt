why does my search engine go to a different website everytime i click on a link after a search?
Example.
I go to google.com and search say yahoo answers.com. when the search results appear i find the link i want, click on it but it goes to something completely different that is some sort of add?? It always does this anytime i search so i have click back and click on the link another time before it actually goes to the webpage i want. whats going on with my computer? Please help its very annoying!
well unless my boyfriend has been searching porn on my laptop thats not the problem. they arent dirty adds just adds in general

that happened to my brothers computer around the same time he started watching porn
