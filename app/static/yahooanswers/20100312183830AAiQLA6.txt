How to get online fonts into Paint?
How do I take online text fonts into Word and Paint

Just install the fonts normally and they should show up.
What should happen is when you download them (you need admin rights) and save them into your win32 or win64 it should automatically work for all windows based programs
Install/copy them to appropriate location.  In XP (classic view of control panel) there is a fonts icon you can copy/paste them right there (also works with Windows 7).
You can go to www.dafont.com download any font you wish to have.
after downloading it. Extract it with WinRAR.
go to your control panel and look for the file where it says "fonts"
open the folder up and drag the font file into it.
Then you'll have the font's for paint, microsoft word and any other program that include text.
