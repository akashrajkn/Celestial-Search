Applying for PayPal Debit Card?
I don't see the link to apply for a PayPal debit card on the products and service tab.
I reside in UAE (Middle East).
And my account is a premier one.

Because there are so many email phising going on, I would manually type in the URL address. www.paypal.com and apply from that site.
