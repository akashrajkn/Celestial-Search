Does amazon.com exist in Spain or Scotland?
I am wondering if people who live in Spain and people who live in England, Scotland and Wales can access amazon.com? or is it only in the US?

hey everybody watch out for this chick she is on SUPER CRACK

WHAT KIND OF COKED UP WOMAN ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AMAZON.COM!

Seriously.
MILFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
i swear. here is my ultimate fantasy:you with an asian midget. the asian midget is giving me mild buttsex while u blow me. 
BYEEEEE
p.s. they have it in spain, but not scotland.
In the Uk we have Amazon.co.uk. We can still use Amazon.com but it means paying in dollars and a fortune for delivery.

Dunno about spain but I'm assuming they have amazon.esp or something like that.
Not quite sure what the Asian midgets have to do with anything, but sounds interesting. Anyway, You can still use Amazon.com in Spain ( or Scotland ) if you choose, but it would be be wiser to use Amazon.co.uk.
    Spain does not yet have an Amazon.es  but almost all .co.uk   products are available for delivery overseas at a reasonable cost.
Yes we can access the .com domain but it is not really necessary. The .uk domain is for Scotland.

Amazon also have at least two distribution warehouses in Scotland serving all of UK and beyond.

Also, the Amazon Development Centre is actually based in Scotland. They develop new features and functionality for all Amazon's global websites.
