amazon.com or ebay.com?
Where would you shop online?  amazon or ebay?

ebay
Amazon
ebay.com
Depends on what I wanted & where I could find the best price.  A lot of the dvds I want are expensive on ebay, Amazon wins hand down in that category (I can save anything up to 60%)
For everything else, ebay gets my business.
So if I had to pick a 'winner" it would be ebay.
