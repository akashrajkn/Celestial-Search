Does anyone see the cycle?
Whenever youtube/facebook/twitter releases a new layout,every teen complains about it,but when they release the next layout,everybody says that the old one(which they hated when it came out) was better.
Any thoughts?

Most people don't like change especially when they are comfortable with a layout or in general. They'll complain at first, but once they get used to it, they are able to compare and contrast.
It's because they got used to the old new/old one. Plus its probably not only teens who get annoyed from it.
Teens complain about everything!
Personally, I don't like change in sites like those. Especially when the one that is up at the time is perfectly fine. But you get used to the new one then it changes again and here we go again!!
The site people just wanna keep it interesting, modern and up to date.
I've noticed that over the last year or so YouTube has COMPLETELY changed the whole layout. I hated that they'd changed it so dramatically so quickly but looking back at the old layout it was very bulking and I wouldn't like it to be changed back! 
They just want to improve and make the time spent on the site more interesting and make you want to come back.
