how can I meet someone twice on chatroulette or got my conversations back ?
On a friday night I had a wonderful conversation me Sultan with Chloe ( or Chole ) on Chatroulette . It was the first one I had and the last because we agreed not to back to that bad chat again . It was full of naked and sick old men . Unfortunately I went out without recalling saving" Chole" skype . Now I have nothing to contact her again . May be this is stupid but is there anyway to get your conversation back ?.. Many thanks

if you cleared it there is no way... you could look through your flash cookies if they are still there although very unlucky.. sorry.

http://camstumble.com has ways of getting back in touch which chat roulette doesn't.
