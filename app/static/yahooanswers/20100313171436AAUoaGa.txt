Internet explorer 8 problem?
Please help.

I tried downloading Internet Explorer 8  to my computer.   Now when I try to open Internet Explorer it goes on for a split second and closes again.   Just a flash on the screen with no error message. 

I tried running it without add-ons.   I went in and fixed corrupt files in my system.   Nothing works.

Itunes can connect to the Internet ok.

I have a netbook and can only access the computer via the Internet or USB.   I do not have any other browsers installed.

Help!

Run the FixIE utility.  It re-registers alot of the .dll's IE uses.
