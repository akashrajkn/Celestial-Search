Hi

I seem to have similar problem and for me closing the browser then reopen sometimes works or reload password or repair option gets things working.But have not found a fix but on one restart microsoft pop up said known fault but no fix yet?So I'm hoping they get back with a fix soon.
Its happening to me too! Its really annoying I have a coursework deadline for tomorrow. I live in Norfolk and near Norwich and I know its not happening to everyone. Im not getting any errors when I go online its just my Home Hub 2.0 keeps getting and Orange light on the broadband section!

If anyone knows whats happening, it may be they're doing some works but I thought that would be notified beefore it happened, please let me know thanks.
