How do sites know when a person has multiple accounts?


IP address.
Usually by IP address.

By your ISP or Internet Service Provider signature code.
of course, through your IP address, but i have got a browser which opens with a different Ip address each time you open it, so this browser can also solve your rapidshare problem, for details visit
