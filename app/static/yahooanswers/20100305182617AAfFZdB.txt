URL doesn't work in firefox?
My URL bar no longer works in firefox. When I type in a URL or select one of the saved sites nothing happens. My web connection is fine, I tried downloading the latest version (3.5.8) but no luck.
Please help!
thx

You have a proxy server enabled in the firefox settings. go to tools, options, advanced, network, settings, then NO PROXY..
3.6 is the latest version of Firefox. Try clearing ALL history.
If that doesn't work, find the preferences file for Firefox and trash it, when Firefox is started again it will make a new preferences file.
