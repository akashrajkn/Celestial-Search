Is firefox 3.6 not compatible with realplayer11gold? Or I should go to 3.5.2?


go to the newer firefox. firefox is good for your computer.
Consider tiring a different browser. Ive been using Google Chrome for years and i have never had a compatibility problem.

I believe it is. However, RealPlayer is not very good software, there are a lot of good alternatives to it. Also, Google Chrome is a very good browser choice, as someone in this question has stated.
