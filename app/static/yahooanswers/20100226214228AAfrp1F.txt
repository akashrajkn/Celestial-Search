My Firefox Add-Ons disappeared and some websites won't work either after laptop shutdown failure!?
After my stupid laptop battery fell off my laptop, I insert it back in and turned back on. All of a sudden, when Firefox appeared on start-up, All of my Add-ons disappeared and websites like last.fm won't work when I click the "Add To My Library Button". Does anybody know the solution to this issue? My computer is a Windows Vista 7 and I also tried finding files:extensions.ini, extensions.cache and extensions.rdf, but they are nowhere in my Firefox directory. Especially with Hidden Files and Folders enabled. I am also too lazy to reinstall my add-ons and extensions.

if your still not sure on what to do
then go to your local computer store and get them to look at it and fix it for you
