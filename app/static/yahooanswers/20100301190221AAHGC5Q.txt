What is the best FREE, ONLINE video converter that actually works?
I want to convert a "video file" (windows media player) into "mpeg4" for my iPod.
The file is rather big, the video is about 40 minutes long. 
What's a good video converter I can find online (requires no downloading) that's free? Thanks
When I try to play the video in Windows Real Media, it says I need a "CODEC", what is this and how do I get one? I can't watch the video, but there's audio and the file is in "video file" format so it should open with sound & visual?

I dont know if there is a free only video converter. however, you can download a free converter: youtube downloader. it really works:)
any video converter

it requires downloading but u won't find one that doesn't

Yes, you need a "Codec" for your video player, I think you need to install the latest version Windows Real Media, or another Player to play the video.

Gooood luck
