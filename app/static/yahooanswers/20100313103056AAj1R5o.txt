Whats up with babblesex.com?
Every time I try to go to babblesex.com, it directs me to godaddy.com.... why? I was on the website a few days ago.

maybe the domain name expired.
yea i know it totaly sucks this happened last year it lasted for like a whole week i hope it comes back soon!!
Add these three lines temporarily to your 'hosts' file under C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\

174.37.22.18 www.babblesex.com
174.36.228.186 babblesex.com
174.36.228.186 livehubs.com

Reboot to have this take effect.

Edit: If you're having trouble saving the file (in Vista), you should be able to "Run as Administrator"

*Start | All Programs | Accessories
*right-click (NOT left-click) on "Notepad"
*select "Run as Administrator"

... and make the changes shown above.

Some "security" programs will set the 'hosts' file to read-only. Before editing the file, you should be able to right-click on it in the File | Open dialog, select Properties, and clear the "Read-Only" checkbox. "Apply" the change; click "OK" to close the Properties page. You should be back at the File | Open dialog. Select the 'hosts' file as normal and add the lines.
Sat, unfortunately my dear, that doesn't work for those of us using Vista. It won't allow us to Save the file. :(
Thanks Satyr.... it works... i m now connected
Satyr, with what program should I open the "hosts" file?
I do not want to screw up system files and the whole computer, so I want to know exactly what I am doing.

Thanks;

Derek.
the page is down, and dont get up again.
the site will be up and running again soon enough, sides if it stopped working for any length of time all the poor cam girls would be in trouble
