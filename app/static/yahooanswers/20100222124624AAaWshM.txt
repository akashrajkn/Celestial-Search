I REALLY NEED HELP! Please! Quick answers really needed :(?
well, in my house we have a wireless router, that all our laptops etc are connected to, 4 laptops 1 comp. Recently, and this has only been happening to my laptop. . After about 2-5 mins it disconnects from the internet for no reason, and i really need to fix it for work purposes! Please somebody help! I have no idea what it is, i have already tried to back state it from a previous save incase it was software but it doesn't seemed t have worked and i'm having to do this on my phone. . Please, somebody, help? ='(
for a year now it's worked ok, just recently has it decide to disconnect me. . I don't get it?

Have you tried disconnecting one or two of the computers because 5 systems running off of one router can cause it to disconnect and crash alot...
