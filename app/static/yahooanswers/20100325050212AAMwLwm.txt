my sky broadband is active as of wednesday and therefore bt will disappear.?
i desperately need to save some emails from my bt account. i normally access them through yahoo mail. how do i save them or move them? 
now you may think cause i'm on here i know my way around a computer. wrong i know far more about the internals of a farm animal than you'll ever need to know. so if you answer this please put it in english and not computer speak. cheers

why dont you press send on the emails and sent them to your yahoo account. this a very easy way, all you need to know is how to send an email lol. goodluck anyway with that.
you need'nt worry. I am on Sky but I can still access my e-mails in my yahoo account and my wife still uses her btinternet e-mail account. My children still use their yahoo accounts as well. So as I said don't worry as everything will carry on as normal. It will only be your internet provider that changes. I think you have made a good choice with Sky by the way. Good luck.
