It seems as if you're either visiting sites not supported by internet explorer or your browser isn't functioning well...

Either:

1) Upgrade Internet Explorer if you don't have the newest version.
Or...
2) Get a new browser like Firefox.
try deleting all your browsing history and cookies and temporary internet files. everything
Change the browser
