Can't even find wireless networks.?
Alright.My iPhone, Xbox, and 3 other laptops can detect and connect wirelessly to my wireless modem. Yet one can't. I've made sure the WLAN switch is on and indicated by a blue light. I've even tried connecting with the ethernet cable directly to the modem but it still can't detect. Any ideas?

Well you didn't state WHICH ONE... but i'm going to assume the laptop .... lol  Any how, it's probably just the network controller is bad ( in other words your hardware adapter is bad if it's the Xbox or the Iphone ~ i believe thats low chance for those 2 ) 

In the laptop if i was correct, then it's a good chance that the Onboard Wifi is bad, so you may want to get a wireless internet card and try that, but first thing i would try is uninstalling the Networking drivers then reinstalling them.. 

Uninstalling Network device

In windows 7 or Vista Go to the Windows button ( formerly Start button ) Right click on "computer" click "properties" then on the left click "device manager"  ( might say manage devices ) Find the Networking group, and expand that. Find your Network cards or w/e and Uninstall that.. reboot then reinstall ~ then hope for the best~

If it IS your Xbox or Iphone... look into having the manafacturer take a look into it.
