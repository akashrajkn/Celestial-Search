Cheap web hosting.  What is a good cheap web hosting company to use to host a new web site?
I am wonting to lauch a web site and need good reliable cheap web hosting.  Any idea who the best hosting company is?

I, personally, like godaddy.
I'd recommend Fatcow. FatCow offers very fast and highest uptime website hosting deals. I've hosted a few websites on their servers, so far no problems at all. Their technical support at the server end is very prompt and they are quick in any resolution. Unlike many other big names who are expensive and at the same time their turn-around time for any issue is pretty longer. I'm happy with FatCow. >> http://www.webhostingbreak.com/fat-cow-support/
The cheapest hosting I've found is http://www.webhostingpad.com/5494.html offers free wordpress auto install. They have plans that start as low as $1.99 a month and offer a 30 day money back guarantee!! They have web designing programs that are easy to use and look very professional.

Free Domain name
24/7 security server monitoring 
Advanced Firewall 
OS Commerce Shopping Cart 
Password Protected Directories 
Open PGP/GPG Encryption

Go with the best in the business.  Use HostGator.  They have the absolute best customer service and it's easy to navigate and use.  You can try them for the first month for only 1 cent.  Go to http://hostgator-pro.com and follow the steps.  I mean why not try the best web host for only 1 cent and if you don't like it then simply cancel and no questions asked.  Hope this helps.
As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.

a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They're also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.

They include a free point & click online site builder so you can create a website without any programming (easily, just by drag and drop) or you could install Wordpress (they include easy, one click install from their control panel), choose a theme that you like, and start adding content.

They also have a great custom control panel with OneClick installs of all the popular software like Wordpress, Joomla, Forums, Chat, Galleries, Online stores and a lot more.

Also, they have a paid one, that includes .com .net and .org domains, that is around $5 a month, but, they are good.
Dont go for cheap ones. You will be very much disappointed due to loss of time and might be the loss of your data too.

I am happily enjoying BlueHost services since last 4 years and am very much satisfied. I transferred after test and try of several hosting companies but this one is The Best.

I have hosted many domains on 1 single account and have got no issues with them till now.

You can see that they are hosting over 1,000,000 domains which means ofcourse they are the best.

All the best
Hey Bo,

Both Hostgator and Dreamhost are good and are cheap if you use a coupon. The best deal you will probably get right now is the $65 off coupon dreamhost just came out with, which is 65OFFHOSTING. They have a 97 day money back guarantee so worst case if you dont like them you can cancel and get your money back. I have a joomla and wordpress site with them and so far they have been great to work with. If you decide you want to go with a different host, there are coupons for many of them here: http://internethostreviews.com/current-hosting-coupons.

Good luck in your decision.
From experience of various web hosting packages, I would have to say Justhost at the moment. I have now been using them for over a year with my website http://rinaldis.co.uk and there has been very little downtime if any.

Adding to that the unlimited storage and bandwidth along with one of the best prices I have seen so far, it is definitly worth it.

The best Justhost deals are available here: http://tinyurl.com/justhostdeals
Hello yes their is go on to www.publish-your-site.net23.net and click on one of the images, then you can sign up. You can buy a cheap domain or get a free one.  Hope this has helped.
Cheap is not cheap in long run. In fact choose a hosting company which allows "multiple" domain hosting in single account.
You check My Webbie Hosting. They have this Lite Plan, which costs only $3.95/month. The plan already consists of 1.5 G disk space, 150 G monthly data transfer, 50 secured email accounts, and a free domain name. They also assure their customers of 24/7 customer support, one-hour ticket response time, and 99.9% uptime.
