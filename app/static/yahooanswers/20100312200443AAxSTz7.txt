Is there something like this?
I forgot what the website was, where you can like type someones full name and then there will be their adress and number.
Does anyone know the website?
Please help, thaaaaanks! xx (:
But they come up with results from the United States? I need results from Australia, hahah.

You mean, like, you know, the phone book?
People search! Try http://people.yahoo.com/ and there's tons of these, so I don't know which specific one you're talking about. Yahoo is a good one to start with though.
Your a creeper.
