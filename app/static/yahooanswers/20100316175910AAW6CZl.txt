Need healp with polyvore account?
How can I make it so my sets come up on google or if I want to show someone my account without giving them my password?

Well to your first question:
I'm really not sure. It changes and it mostly won't show up, but you can try Google Images. Type Polyvore and then your screen name. e.g; My screen name is "Glamour Kitty" so I will type;
Glamour Kitty Polyvore
This doesn't always work, may I note.

Second question:
That's quite easy, just copy and paste the address (the bar with the website, e.g; http://answers.yahoo.com//www.yahoo.com) of your profile page like so;
http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/profile?id=1139442

Hope this helped!
xo, GK
