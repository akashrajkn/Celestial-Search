Why is my internet running so slowly?
I have wireless internet (my landlord's so I don't know the ISP or anything).  Usually it runs very quickly and I can easily stream videos online, etc.

For the past three days it's been running incredibly slowly, for example the google homepage takes 1-2 minutes to load instead of a few seconds.

The only thing that's changed is that my avast expired so I tried downloading a new one.  It's on my computer with a little stop sign by the icon and windows vista tells me I have no virus protection, though I ran avast last night and it worked fine.  Not sure if this is even related but I thought I'd mention it just in case.

Any advice on how to fix this is very appreciated!!!
OH - Avast tells me I have no viruses by the way.  I ran norton too and there's nothing wrong in that sense.

if you live in a place where it is overcrowded then it's most probably due to all the other people downloading files. And you could also try a disk cleanup. Just go to My Computer on your Start panel, right click properties and click disk clean up.
The all kind of softwares like avasti or norton always slow down ur pc and ur internet connection!!
so it would be nice if u uninstall all of them to get ur speed abck...
THANKS
Have you uninstalled the old avast? Maybe it is still installed. You need to uninstall the old one then the new one. And oh, by the way, never run 2 anti-virus at the same time it causes PC slowdown. Choose just 1 of it.

Also, clear your browsing history and cookies. Have a decent registry cleaner, maybe it needs clean-up.
