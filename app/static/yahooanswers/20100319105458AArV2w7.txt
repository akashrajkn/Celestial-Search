It would have been better if you have given your blog url as well. But going by your question and the details, i saw some issues regarding your approach to blogging. 

here are they:

1) Blogging for traffic is all about creating interesting,useful and unique content. A mere match between what you blog about and what people like reading, starts bringing traffic to a blog.So just focus on what you want to say, say that with conviction. Write for yourself, in all probability, it'll be useful, unique and interesting.

2) To succeed in blogging and reach the highest ranks, is like succeeding in any other profession. one needs conviction in one's talent/passion (talent/passion should be the category one blog's about) to succeed. So don't bother about big names, they were also novice at the beginning.

3) Blogging is all about study and keen observation. 

To promote your blog-- adopt the same approach which one adopts in his or her real life.In blogging context, this is, a) Search for information related to your own blogging category; b) show keen and genuine interest in other people's blog a) leave useful comments d) extend helping hand d) Don't hide information, be keen to share e) Keep learning.

Hope you find my answer useful.

Thanks
