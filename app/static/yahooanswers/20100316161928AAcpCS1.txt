i have just bought a samsung geino slide and i connected by wi-fi to my BT Home hub (my wireless router for my laptop) but now when i try to connect it its says no response from AP what does that mean and how do i fix it ?

It looks like there's a full user guide on the cd that came with your phone according to this video here:

Also, could you be more specific? Connection issues are a dime a dozen thousand. There are usually so many possibilities that without a good understanding of the problem (i.e. the step by step process it took to derive the problem) it becomes nearly impossible to offer a solution.
