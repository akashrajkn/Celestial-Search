Watch movies online free legal?
This is applying to the same question as before. where can i watch movies on the internet without paying.I also said the website should be legal and possibly ad-free. This is becausemy mother got trend micro security carp and it blocks a lot of websites.

Best site I have found this far. It is absolutely free.
A lot of new movies are on this site but you can also find all the classics. Also many movies that are now airing in theaters, can be found here. You can watch different TV shows as well on the same website for free. Movies are full length and high quality. You have the option to just watch them or if you want, download them. Hope this helps you! Enjoy!
