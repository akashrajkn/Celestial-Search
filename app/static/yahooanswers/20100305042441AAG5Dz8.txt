"Order taken" status on Play.com. How long can it last?
Hello. I have an order on Play.com whose status is stuck on "order taken" since almost 6 weeks now (ordered on January 24). It's not the first time this situation happens and usually I just give up after a month and a half and I buy somewhere else. But this time, I'd like to see how long it can stay that way. I just wondered if some users had some experience about this, did they have to wait a really long time (like 2 months or more) until their order finally got shipped?

Happened to me - I emailed them and asked what the hold up was, they sent me and email straight away and shipped the item
Hi
 I have ordered about 30 or more items from Play.com  If the Items have been in stock I  have usually received them within 3 days  If they are  pre-ordered I usually get themwithin two days of them becoming available.

When you first order you get an email telling you the item as gone for packing  then later you get a second email telling you that the order as been posted,
 You can also go to the site and track your order.  I suggest you contact Pay.pal and  sort your problem out   They do not  take the payment from your account until  it has been posted
