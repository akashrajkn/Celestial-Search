where can I do a reverse phone number look up that is 100% FREE and DISCREET?
I would like to perform a reverse phone number look up. I was wondering if there is a website that is 100% FREE, DISCREET and ACCURATE. Also, if you use a PC, is there anyway to totally get rid of the fact I did it? Thank you.

nowhere for free
Go to anywho.com for reverse number look-up.  As for getting rid of the evidence, I have no idea.
