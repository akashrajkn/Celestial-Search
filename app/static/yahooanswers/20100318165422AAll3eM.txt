If I protect my Tweets, does that mean that users who I 'reply' to who aren't following me can't reply to me?
..and if this is the case, how do I sort it out? I like writing on famous people's tweets but there's no point if they can't reply.

because your tweets are protected, anything you write won't be published in the trending topics and people who don't follow you can't see what you're written. so yeah, they won't see what you replied to them unless they follow you.
the only way, and the most obvious way, is to unprotect them (your tweets).
if your tweets are protected because you don't want a specific person on twitter to see them, just block that person. i don't think they'll be able to see them then.

good luck :)
