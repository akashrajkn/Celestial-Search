How do I get this magnification box to go away?
At the moment I'm staying at my cousins house and I'm the only one awake at the moment. I got online to check my stuff and I hit this button on the mouse and a little magnification box showed up on the computer around the mouse now i can't figure out how to get it to go away! I want to gone by the time anyone else wakes up so I don't feel like an idiot! Hurry please!

Try rebooting?
