How do I transfer a place I have previously made on Roblox that is saved on my computer, to Roblox?
I had just finished making a 'Place' on Roblox and I tried to exit and the save pop-up box came up saying whether i wanted to save. I clicked 'Save' and the Roblox programme froze for 5 minutes or so, the on the pop-up box it said 'Import failed please try again' but the 'Save' button had changed it now said 'Save local' I clicked that and saved it to my computer. Now I want to know how to transfer my work back to Roblox so 1. I can can get off my computer and 2. So people can play it because Roblox still had my unfinished version! Please help I need answers real fast! http"//www.roblox.com/

Just click the place in your computer (tools, file, open then it will load and come up!)
