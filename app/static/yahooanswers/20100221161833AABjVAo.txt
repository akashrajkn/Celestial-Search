Need simple internet help--Cannot display webpage?
Okay, I have an HP Pavilion Entertainment Laptop, 2009 bought..2007 Vista Home Premium 64 bit, and I upgraded from Internet Explorer 6 to 8. 

Since today, I have not been able to get on a few sites:
www.walmart.com
www.ebay.com

I can get on:
Facebook
barnesandnoble.com
Google
Yahoo

Phishing filter is off, firewall down, medium security. Connected thru spliter for phone line/Broadband, can use phone at the same time on internet.

when I type in the brower the websites, it will say, "this page cannot be displayed" tryed reloading, tried restarting, updates, intercnnection is fine.

What is wrong, and how can i fix it>>???

There are compatibility filters you can use in IE8, that may help
I tend to switch all the new 'features' off myself when installing it (for my daughter)

Try a different browser, it doesn't hurt to have several installed - just be careful of the new browser making itself the default when you first install it, there should be a ticked box you can untick.

Firefox, Opera and Chrome all have their good points. I prefer Firefox with adblockplus myself
i used to get this problem all the time with INTERNET EXPLORER so i just use GOOGLE CHROME now,it does everything the other one does but quicker and i never have that problem now
