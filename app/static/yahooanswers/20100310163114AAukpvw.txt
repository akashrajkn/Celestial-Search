How Do I make money from Hubpages.com?
Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I couldn't fit it anywhere else. 


I don't understand how I get paid for my writing. They said you have to set up an affiliate account and that is how you get paid. They say something about the ads on your page. It is up to google or amazon or ebay to pay for their ads? Do you write with Hubpages.com? How have you done this?

Hubpages shares 60% of the revenue from clicks on adsense ads and eBay, Amazon ads you select to place on the pages. They actually share raw clicks, you have to set up your account with each of the advertisers just like when running your own site, hubpages provides forms that make things a little easier.

You can go to myAccount/Affiliate Settings to request and enter the account codes you will get back in emails.

Serious hubbers have 100+ pages.  You can also add your own affiliate links for which you receive 100% of the revenues, you are limited to 2 links to any one site, and can't make blatantly commercial pages.

It's not a bad place to start generating income, it's easier to get hub pages indexed than a brand new private site. Be sure to back up your pages in case you account is suspended for who knows why.
Working from home means one of two things:
A) you have a good idea of the product or service you want to market and have the means to do market it with out much help.
B) you are in need of a business model that you can adapt and you wish to piggy back on the other companies expertise.
The first does not require that you pay a start up fee but the second does. So, if you don't have a business in mind that you can start right away from your home without anyone' help. You have to pay a start up fee.
