is there an eBay prepaid card?
I have an account on ebay and paypal but was curious if their was a prepaid card I could pay for an item with, A card I could put money on then pay?

Ebay does NOT offer any cards if that's what you are asking. But there are prepaid cards that work with PAYPAL.
And PAYPAL works with ebay.
