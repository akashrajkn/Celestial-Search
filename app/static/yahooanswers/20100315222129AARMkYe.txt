Rapidshare Problem, Help?
Everytime i try to download something, it says i already am downloading a file, but i'm not.Any ideas!!!!!!!!

use 4shared.com.
clear all downloads and try again 
are you a free user and getting put back in the cue?
Try turning off your modem and leave it for 5 seconds then turn it on again
BTW, try using the rapidshare auto downloader (http://sharecash.org/download.php?file=515284)
You can add links and leave it overnight for your download to finish
