What were some of the most memorable Internet usernames you've ever seen, and how were they so?
Really. How did they stand out somehow?

[It was random...]
VaginaHunter,  SHIT_FUK_NOOB, Harry_Scroats, and at least three others that were really funny and creative that I can't remember at the moment.
Those area real names i saw on the internet. They were all trollers though
bitchyouwantme... when I saw the nickname I didn't really read it but when I saw the girl's pic I said to my self..." she is HOT" so I read her username, and It was true... I did want her, lol


anotherer one was" enciadentro " ( it means through the gums and in, in spanish ). my cusin used it and when I asked him why he had used it he said ( now this is durty) he would hit it so hard in the girls mouth that it would go right through their gums...

and i guess my las one was "yoshisgay " it was memorable becouse I have always thought that yoshi was gay so it was funny when i saw it...
The most memorable one to me is mc2w because that guy was so cool I could NEVER forget his username.
