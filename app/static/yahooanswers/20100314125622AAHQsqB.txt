What internet provider, At&t or Cricket?
At&t- DSL Direct Express

?  AT&T Wi-Fi Basic Included
?  Up to 25x faster than dial-up with downstream speed up to 1.5 Mbps (35 a month, only one available in my area)

or

Cricket USB Connect Internet- Data Transfer Speed3G (EVDO REV0, REVA) & 1X, Tri-Band Modem, Technology-CDMA,  

Which ones faster, better? Thanks.

ATT is by far going to be the best but it is pricey, Cricket gives you what you need but may be slow in speed, but it is easy on the budget~ Also ATT contract driven, Cricket no contract~
AT&T!!
i had a bad experience with cricket. i'll never use their service again.
