Your ISP knows.

Yes, ISP can do that.
Although ISP normally don't bother monitoring user internet use unless they find something suspicious or are forced by some watchdog group looking for pirates..
You can reroute ur traffic thru Identity protector websites like www.ctunnel.com, www.anonymouse.com.

Instead of urs, their IPs will be visible.
