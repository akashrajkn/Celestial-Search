How do you recover your Login ID in your JobsDB account?
I forgot both my password and ID but I know there's a way of retrieving your password, but not your ID, can anybody help?

Go to the login page and look for 'Forget ID' button. If you register that account by another email, the system may send you account information to your registered email account.

Later, try some freeware like CyberDash (http://www.totoware.com) to manage your account.
