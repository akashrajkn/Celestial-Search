Whats the fastest internet you can get?
i have time warner cable and its to slow for me, is there internet that downloads faster than 236 kilobytes a second im hoping to get something that has around 4 or 5 mb a second or anything faster than what i have for under 200 dollars a month

yes, at&t uverse is 6mb
Cable gets up to 10mbs. You measure speed in bits, not bytes. If your download speed is 236 kilobytes, it's close to 2mbs.
 Verizon Fios is the only thing faster if it's available. Up to 50mbs.
