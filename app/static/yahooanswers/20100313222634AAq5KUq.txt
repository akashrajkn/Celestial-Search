extreme difficulty signing into dol website? (at least the one in CT)?
does anybody find it extremely difficult to sign into the dept of labor site, at least in CT? i repeatedly keep getting stupid messages like "timeout: your session has been at idle for 30 minutes" when it hasnt even been 10 seconds in between attempts to get through, also i keep getting "system only available during available times" and i would be trying to file unemployment during the available time. my login info is always correct. my question is this: are there any connecticut residents that have extreme difficulty logging into the dept of labor site, and are you getting those stupid messages just like me? and why is this? why is there a traffic limit to this stupid site? why would the webmaster do something so dumbassly stupid? (its now taken me 2hrs to try and file when it should only be a 15min task, if that.) anyways, any info is greatly appreciated. thx

that means their server needs rebooting or resetting. nothing you can do until monday.
