Can malware put porn on your computer?
If so, is it possible to tell whether said porn is actually malware or if it was actually watched by someone on your computer?

Yes, malware can put porn onto an infected computer. Determining if someone actually downloaded the porn or if it was installed by the malware would be more difficult.

See my source for an article about this type of malware:
Yes, it can put anything on your computer.

Even a webpage can put hidden pictures onto your computer. By resizing them as 1x1 pixels on your screen, but it's really a full-size pic in your cache (hard disk).

Can you tell if someone looked it it? That would be very difficult, and would have errors. So you could not tell for sure.
Malware sure can put porn and other things on your computer!
