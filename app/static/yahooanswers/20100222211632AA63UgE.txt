Does every computer has it's own IP address or does every net connection has its own IP address?
1) I want to know if every different computer has its own IP address or does every internet connection has its own IP address? For example, if we are 3 people using same internet connection at home, will the three computers have the same IP address?

2) Does the IP address change from internet connection to another one?

Thanks

dont know
Both.  Every computer has it's own IP on the local network, and the net connection has an IP that it shows to the internet at large.

To check the local IP (Windows): Start > Run > Type "cmd" > OK.
Type "ipconfig" (no quotes) > Press enter.

To check the net connection's IP:  Visit http://www.ip-adress.com/
That's a good question!  The answer is that your computer does NOT have an IP address, but your internet connection does..Computers on a network would use subnets of your main domain.
The answer is yes.

Your internet connection as a whole has an IP address. You can get this by going to http://www.ipchicken.com

In addition, your router assigns "internal" IPs to each computer that it sends data to. These are called your IPv4 Address and almost always start with 192.168.x.xx

Also, your router has it's own address which is called your Default Gateway. If you put your Gateway address into your web browser, it will open up your router settings menu.

You can find your internal number by opening your command prompt and typing in IPconfig

(access command prompt by doing start>>Run>>CMD)
I guest an IP address owned by every single modem, so if there are 3 computers with one modem, its surely have 1 IP adress.
