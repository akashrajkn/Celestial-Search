Weird thing that happened...did a virus copy my files?
I have Pest Patrol. I was using the internet and all of a sudden a message flashed up saying I have a virus and a box came up with a progress bar as if my E (flash drive) was being downloaded by someone. I unplugged my flash drive very quickly (before the progress bar finished) and x-ed out of internet. What are the odds that someone was actually able to copy my files?

that are fake sites dont trust them
dont trust a pop up
dont worry that was just a illustration
go to your control panel panel and check out your security out?go to your internet options and check that out?check out to see if you need to down-load any up-dates,up datr your viruses too?check out your favorities to see if what was going to be down-loading? good luck
Odds are minimal
