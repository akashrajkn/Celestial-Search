What happens if you get caught lying about your age on a website where you need to be at least 18?
just need answers. none of the "what were you doing on the website" or "you shouldn't lie"

If you mean the website catching you, then the worst they can do is to shut down your account and/or block you.
they probly couldnt be bothered to do anything ever. but if they do catch you theyll track your ip address and report it to the police - ending in probly a small fine. i wouldnt worry about it
Most likely, they won't catch you. But if they do, you could be taken to court and possibly fined for false identity and possibly illegal content.
They may ban and block you. But the worst thing they can due and is very rare is track your location via your IP address and report it to the police. Which may just end up in a warning or small fine. But it is very rare to ever get caught, so don't worry about it.
