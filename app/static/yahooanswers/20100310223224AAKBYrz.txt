Most of the sites are fraud. some ask you to pay some advance money. but not refundable. and after your work. they simply reply you rejected for errors. i have much experience. think of creating a website..
You can write articles for various blogs or you can create your own blog on a specific niche ( a blog can be easily created on www.blogspot.com )

After your blog is up you have to add original content every day and bring visitors. There are various method to boost your traffic ( http://www.techmazing.com/how-to/123-7-ways-to-use-twitter-to-boost-website-traffic/ ) , just make a search.

After you get some visitors you can monetize your blog with Google Adsense or Chikita

First you need to educate yourself on all that's available that you would be interested in doing. There are more ways to earn online than there stars in the sky. Well, maybe not that many but it can be over whelming.

I started by signing up for all the newsletters, mini-courses and such that I could find. You will filter throught them till you find the ones that appeal to you.

Once you find something you are interested in, you have to make a decision that will call you to action. If you can't do this, and you only wish and talk about wanting, then you will never have what you want.
