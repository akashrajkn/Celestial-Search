What does "Http/1.1 Service Unavailable" mean?
Keeps happening when I try to go to anything with youtube. I just cleared my cookies and still happening. Perhaps it'll go away eventually?

i'm having the same problem.
you know the same exact
thing is happening with me right now.
it means the website is down for maintence 
it usually fixes itself in about an hour or so. because no working website means no business and we know how YouTube is...:)
Yes, it is happening to me too. I believe it is down to maintence. Which sucks because I'm sick and bored today, wanted to watch some videos on my day off.
