Is Lockerz losing members?
I am asking this because Lockerz has quadrupled(x4) their prices recently. Are people still keeping faith in Lockerz or are they leaving? TEN POINTS for best answer!

yes they are, no one thrusts them anymore... although i don't :P
I pretty much gave up, kinda sad, the prices are too much for me. I'm doing the login and daily's, thats all. Don't even bother to watch the videos. I just switched to swagbucks, easier by far. Theres a refer link in my profile if your interested. Unless they get new ways to earn ptz, they'll lose all their members except for the Z-list ones. TRY TO MAKE ADVERTISING MONEY OFF THAT, LOCKERZ
no way lockerz has never been better hundres of people are joining lockerz everyday theres just so many people that why the prizes have quadrupled but the prices of the prizes are still extremely low compared to swagbucks on swag you get 10 points a day and a xbox 360 is like 60,000 points so lockerz all they way!!!
The first 3 months of lockerz was a trial period. Prices were so low as a "thank you to the first members". Now that there are more and more people joining they believe it is nessesary to up their prices to reduce competition. However, as a blog post by lockerz a few days ago they also said while although prices are 4x now they will also be comming out with more ways to earn points besides the 4 points daily.
