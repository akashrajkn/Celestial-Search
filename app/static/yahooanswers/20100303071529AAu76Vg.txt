Is the airtel broadband modem portable?
Plz help. Also, does the 256 kbps broadband unlimited plan really give 256 kbps or just 30kbps. If any of u have used it plz help.  I am from kolkata. So, any answer from kolkata would help even better.

256 kbps just gives you 28 to 30 kbps download. I upgraded to 512 unlimited, just 1100 + 10% tax. Modem is portable ,ofcourse these  days you dont get big modems mate. 512 unlimited is worth the price , you can download at speed of 55 to 60 kbps
