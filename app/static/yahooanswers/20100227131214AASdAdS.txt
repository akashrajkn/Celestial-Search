Is it 100% reliable?? Have you done anything on it?? Thanx...=)

seems phishy.
dont do it. 99% of them are fake, theres no real telling.
As the owner of windowspcsupport.webs I do advise you not to use such a site!  I would never trust anything which says free goods which are worth over ?10 are safe and reliable. It a company which uses there users to spam there friends to help them grow members on there site
Don't do it, its most probably a scam.
Its a way to get information off of you, so they can target you for selling stuff. They want your email address and home address. Your name will go into thousands of others and they may pull your name. If they even do that.  Stay away from it.  "good luck"
this site work for marketing companies, they collect personal info and sell them on, you will not get a thing of this site or any other site similar to it.
Don't do it.  It works as an affiliate marketing scheme, that is you only get gifts if you get other people to sign-up and take up "offers", and do some yourself.  These are very risky because they are "free trials" which people end up having to pay for if they do not cancel on the right date, and some are just reductions they have to pay for, or things like signing up for a bank account or car insurance, and lots of gambling sites are included.

A page here of the first set of offers you would need to choose from and the sort of things you would have to try to convince other people to sign up for:
