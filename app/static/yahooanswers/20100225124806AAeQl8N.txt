is cha cha completely free? or will they charge me some stupid fee?
i dont want to be screwed by cha cha. also, but i hear its a really useful and neat service. is it DEFINITELY FREE???? will they ask me for my info ever?

YES it is 100% free. *cha cha is payed for through advertisements. ill explain below.

YES they will ask you for your age, sex, and zip code. dont worry, this is so they know what types of advertisements to send you. zip code is so they know where you live, in case you ask them something about movie times, restaurant locations, ect.

You can either call or text cha cha. (in my experience calling works way better, as long as you speak clearly). 

*HOW IT WORKS:
Ask them a question.
You will be sent something along the lines of "cha cha got your question! check out walmart for blah blah!"
Then you will be sent a second text with the answer to your question.

cha cha, for the most part, is operated by guides. REAL PEOPLE that answer your questions.

text your question to cha cha at 242-242
call cha cha at 1-800-224-2242
