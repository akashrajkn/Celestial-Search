Is there a social networking site where everyone leaves me the hell alone?


I think that's what we call a Korean MMORPG. Nobody can afford to take a minute away from grinding to give you the time of day, let alone a chain letter.
TWITTER! No one knows you there and people don't follow unless they mysteriously find you. Go there, its your best bet. btw follow me! @MeanMuggah11
You need an anti social networking site.
