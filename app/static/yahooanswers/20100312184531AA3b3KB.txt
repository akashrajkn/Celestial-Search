My Internet Explorer Won't Work?
Well, whenever I open it up, it tries to load but then it opens another window and it would say "Would You Like to Run or Save This File?" and whenever i try run, it won't work and if i click save, it won't work either. I try it several times but still nothin. I need it to access other sites and my itunes store but can't.

your shortcut to internet explorer is corrupted use the all programs menu from the start button and see if that works
It sounds like you've become victim to a browser Hi-jack. Also for future
record don't click on 'run' when something like this happens. Basically
when the browser opened the Hi-jack tried to download/save a file. When
you click 'run' it automatically runs w/e the Hi-jacker wanted you to
download. If it was a virus then you're now even more heavily infected
then you were before.

If you're able to transfer any files onto the computer then you will need
to download and transfer the following files onto the machine. The links
are labeled with short details about each. They're all trusted and none
will harm your computer.

FireFox - A powerful web browser built on security and reliability in mind.
It's been nominated the best and most secure web browser for more than
4 years running. There's a lot of competition out there but FireFox still
stands as my personal favorite:

download after the page loads.

Keep in mind that with all of this security you will notice a small
to medium decrease in performance. If you feel your computer
is running too slow then feel free to disable the firewall by right
clicking on the 'Z' icon ( also looks like red/green bars ) on the
bottom right of your screen and click on 'Disable ZoneAlarm'.

All of the software is free and has proven to be the most effective
in the working environment. If you have any questions feel free
