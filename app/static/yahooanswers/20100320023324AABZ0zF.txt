better than way back machine archive.org?
so, i used to have a profile with blogs and videos and images that i would update often.
trying to look back and retrieve them, i used archive.org but found it only picked up about 4 'versions' and therefore am missing additional things i was forever changing on a weekly basis basically!

how can i get far more detailed and comprehensive views of my now non-existent web page profile?
thanks for the tip - i know sometimes Googling does work and you can just view the cached version.. but not always i guess :(

google it
