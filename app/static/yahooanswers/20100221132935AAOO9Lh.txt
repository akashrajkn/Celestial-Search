I don't remember this?
okay so I just remember something but I don't know the website anymore. this is what I remember was that its about fairies, and each of them had there own styles. like one was named diva and she had purple hair that was an afro and wore like some type of white 70's clothes and one was like a fire type who wore purple clothes that had fire on her pants, her hair was red in short pig-tails. and there was one guy who looked like a metal head, with a scorpion tattoo on his chest. and they where other characters but I dont want to describe them. but I remember how they look but I just don't know what's the website. please help me, thanks
