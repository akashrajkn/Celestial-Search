Facebook Chat Problem?
I cant chat to anyone on facebook! For example it will say 5 ppl are online and when I click on their name, It says they are offline, It has been going on for around a month now, And I know their online. What is this??

too bad
Maybe because Facebook chat does not update in real-time. Same with the live feed of status updates.They need to fix that.
