is it safe to sell on ebay?
If I want to keep my personal information (real name, address, etc) a secret on there, is that possible? Is it possible for some sicko to track me down through it?

No. 100% safe. They will have a easier time tracking you down using your Yahoo ID.
When you go on e-bay are you able to see personal info on the sellers?
In your case definitely not
Its safe. If you are not sure, don't use a return adress, subscribe to Ebay's new Security feature, and try to conseal your IP adress.
