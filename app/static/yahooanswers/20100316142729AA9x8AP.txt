Will we get charged extra on our Internet bill since we got a wifi box?
We recently got a wifi box to plug up to our normal broadband box. It didn't ask us to sign up for anything, but I wanted to make sure that all we pay is our normal Internet bill and that there are no additional charges.

There will not be any extra charges
google it before you ask next time. Please. This question has already been answered numerous times and it is the second time I answer it today

No you wont get charged extra
they only why you are to know is by calling them up and finding,or wait for the bill.
