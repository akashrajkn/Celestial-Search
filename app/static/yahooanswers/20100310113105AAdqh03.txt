Is firefox or safari better?


Firefox, No Doubt. Way more Secure and Ten times faster too. The Safari Browser was designed for the MAC PC's and just recently they have ported it over to Windows for use. Good Luck
Firefox definitely. I've done Firefox and Safari side by side, and Firefox is amazingly fast. It is the only browser I use, I will never switch back to a different web browser ever again... especially internet exploder...
GOOGLE CHROME!

Firefox most defintaly because firefox is more faster
