Hows long does lockerz redemption last?
How does does a general Lockerz redemption usually last? I've heard people saying it last like few seconds? Wtf. I've seen videos of people just scrolling down on the page and there are still a lot of good prizes and its redemable. So how long does it last? And how much of each stuff does lockerz have?

well, out of the two experiences i had, in December and January. They usually last like 5 minutes. Because every one comes when the store opens at the first minute.
