Spotify Waiting list?
Hey all, i am getting really pissed off now with Spotify. I put my name on the waiting list in September 2009 and i still have no invite code... My question is does anyone know how long it will take to get one. Of course someone sending an invite is welcome. Just send it to exterminater700@hotmail.com 
however i would be satisfied with an eta.

Thanks 
Adam
