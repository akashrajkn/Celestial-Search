How is anontalk.com a running website?
This website is horrible. I don't understand how it can be running?

What are you 12? there is nothing wrong with it. It is a simple website that allows people to anonymously talk about what ever they want.

This means that the web host can not be held accountable for what is placed on there. It is not like there is some organization regulating whether or not someone can have a website before it is put on the interwebs.
Lol, looks like Sysop deigned to answer your question.
The answer is simple: Anontalk is owned and operated by a Swedish man named "Kimmo Alm". You see, in Sweden, it's a common occurrence for an adult to get into a heavy petting session with a toddler. I'm sure if people read your question, visited the site in question, and returned to answer; they'd be dumbfounded to find any sort of reply. Except for that one guy, he's probably "SysOp", purveyor (more like perveyor, amirite? lol) of the child porns.

tl;dr The authorities in Sweden can't be bothered with things like child pornography, there are far more important things to handle, like the pirate bay.
