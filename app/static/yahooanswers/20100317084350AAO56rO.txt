Why does Verizon DSL not offer promotional discounts to current customers?
I'm stuck paying 29.99 for 1Mbps and they have promotions like 14.99 for life for new customers. If i ask to get in on the deal or any others, they never allow it..Is there some trick I am missing?

that is how it is with verizon? no offense intended.to them they may not think of you as a new member anymore?
These promotions are for attracting new customers, hence not having Verizon DSL is a requirement.
