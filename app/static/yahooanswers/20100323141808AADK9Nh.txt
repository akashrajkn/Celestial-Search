What is your favorite webcomic?
why?

Air Force Blues.  I like it because I'm in the Air Force and there's a lot of inside jokes.  Also, it has a very well developed plot / storyline, and it has a long history.  Since it's online I can read it for free and look up archived strips anywhere in the world.
