Some sites not working with FireFox why?
I am using FF 3.6 when i try to open some sites it wont open eg.Face book Orkut etc etc. And others some downloading sites if i click to download it dont show the download button.Iam also using GChrome it doesnt have this problem.But its been attacked by virus pleeessss help me to solve this problem?

Trust me,OPERA is the best browser.Its fast,has unique features and even when a website is very slow to load you just click turbo mode and it loads the website.Ive tried every browser and im most impressed with opera
