I use firefox but internet explorer still opens my hotmail and some other programs. How do i get to just firefox?

usually when you open firefox it should say make firefox your defult browser or somthing like that, and you have to click yes. hope it helped
You don't delete Internet Explorer, it is an integral component of the Windows Operating System.

Find the configuration settings in FireFox (something like Tools\Options) and set it as your default browser.
you dont delete you unistall
and you dont need to do that anyway
just change the default program to what you want, not IE
If you really don't like Windows Internet Explorer to disturb your Firefox browser then read on...

Windows Internet Explorer is Installed in your computer and you cannot delete it like a normal file but you can remove it or uninstall the program so that it may stop functioning with Firefox.

My way of doing it is like this:

1. Go to start and click control panel
2. There you'll see a list of categories, click on the Add or Remove Programs
3. After clicking the Add or Remove programs a new window appears showing all the programs installed. Just scroll down and you'll find Windows Internet Explorer and click on it.
4. At your right there's a Remove button, click this and it will remove windows internet explorer.
5. A dialogue box appears telling you to remove this program or not, by click the yes and no button. Click Yes to remove Windows Internet Explorer.

I hope this works.
