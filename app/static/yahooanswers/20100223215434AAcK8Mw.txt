Cha Cha account deactivation?
Your ChaCha account has been deactivated for 3 days for Guide Agreement Violation. This is due to violations of the guide agreement and was specifically highlighted in the KnowledgeBase under ChaCha's Infraction & Response Chart. Your account is under research and payment will be made within the next 45-60 days for outstanding balance less fraudulent searches.



Can someone please tell me what this means? If you have ever used cha cha?

Yeah they sent that to me once before too..then they sent me a notice a few hours later saying my account was activated again..lame. I hate ChaCha. I did it for maybe 3 days before I wanted to blow my brains out. Have you received the "what can I use around the house to masturbate with?" question yet? Sometimes the expediter answers are even worse than the questions....ChaCha lets their "employees" get away with murder. I went to KGB...Its much harder to get into ( you actually have to be somewhat intelligent) and they don't let you get away with anything..yeah...that was annoying so i quit that too. Good luck and don't worry im sure ChaCha will re-activate your account, its all just for appearances ...they really don't give a fuck.
