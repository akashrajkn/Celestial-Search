What happened to rsbot?
Yeah what happend to there website? I went there and its some german stuff.

With the information I know, it was shut down for legal issues. I'm looking further into it.
Its dutch not german, and i also see this as well duno what happened.

Someone on another forum said it got DDOS'D
No one knows exactly what happened, except for the admins.
Two possibilities:
1. They didn't pay their hosting bill.
2. Jagex shut it down.

The second possibility is the least likely because, the RSBot.org ToS states that any employee of Jagex cannot enter their site.
RsBot.org staff says its because of jagex, read their twitter page here: http://twitter.com/Rsbotorg
This the story im gettin out of it rsbot got sick of keep updating even the new lobby and stuff and they said that jagex found out but there going to make a way good one in a few months and probably going to use a differant website. unless rsbot actually got sue.
