does feboz toolbar or www.whosee.me have viruses?
i was on a facebook group and they said invite everyone to event and go on www.whosee.me in order to download feboz toolbar to see who looks at my profile. would i get viruses if i downloaded it ?

More than likely, yes. Facebook doesn't allow you to know who views your profile. Another website won't be able to tell.

Surf smart.
yes
no
i dont know
No. It will not tell you who views your facebook profile but if you signup for feboz then it works and tell you who views your feboz profile. Toolbar is for signup only. I m on feboz and its almost like facebook. If you wish to join a new social network then I think its a better option. Toolbar do not have virus because its an approved and safe toolbar. I am also using it.
