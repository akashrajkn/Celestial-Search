Any good websites for teens?
I need a good website to get on, computer is getting boring these days.  Suggest many if you wish.
Thanks:)

fukung.net, if you don't mind some nudity.
stumbleupon.com is also good.
teenmag.com
geekologie.com
omegle.com
youtube, you never know what youll find =]
Try the mmorpg browser games, I would say : www.prisonstruggle.com is the best but there are hundreds out there.
Why yes, try this website! I'm sure you will enjoy it!

http://www.teenhelp.org/ if you have issues in life...like alot of teens. 

If not...go browse amazon, start a wishlist, that keeps me entertained for a while. 
Start a blog. Start a website. That really does keep you entertained for hours, mostly trying to start the whole thing up, then you get obsessed with changing it every 10 seconds lol.

i have one website that i know you will love. it is slow right now because i am working on updates and looking for sponsors to help me with the site. if you want email me at letter966623@yahoo.com if you have any questions. the site is www.teenspacev2.com. when it is off maintenance it will be lots of fun. spread the word about the site so it becomes popular so i can add more things for people who request things. look for people who are having the same question and tell your schoolmates.
