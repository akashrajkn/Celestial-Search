How do I use the picture on the Bing homepage as my computer background?
I like the picture that Bing.com has as its background. I would like to put it as my computer's background. But I cannot figure out how to do it. Anyone know how?

Right click then click where it says Set As Background :D
right click on the picture and when the box pops up click on save as background!
You'll need to save the image, you can do this by using a browser such as firefox, right clicking and selecting "view page info", selecting the media tab and then scrolling through the images.
Alternatively, if you're looking for the tiger picture:
http://www.bing.com/fd/hpk2/BengalTiger_EN-US877040132.jpg
right click ang save image as then go 2 where you saved the bing pic and right click and set as background. u're all done
