Chatroulette won't let me type?
So my boyfriend and I were talking to people on Chatroulette and I noticed I'd be able to type for a little bit, but then the box would just go dark and it wouldn't let me type. Why is this?

Simple, bugs.

Just like the random disconnects while you're having a really good conversation. For now they are part and parcel of the website.
