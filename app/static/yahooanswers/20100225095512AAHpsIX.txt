can i use two sniping programs for ebay at once?
two different programs for 1 item. like if i set one to snipe at 10 seconds and the other at 5 seconds? i want to do this just in case there is another sniper.. but will the two programs cancel each other out or something? i desperately want what i'm bidding on!! 

also my laptop is brand new-i got it like 2-3 months ago. it has roadrunner wireless internet and has windows 7 and when ever i search something on google, the time(it tells you how many seconds it took in the upper rightish area) that it takes to search is always less that one second like 0.60 or less. so how many seconds would you recommend i set my AuctionSniper program at?

There really isn't any point, you just need to put as high a bid as you feel is worthwhile on the item about six seconds before the end. If someone snipes it at three seconds they will only win if they are bidding more than you are willing to pay. 

The thing about sniping is that no one really has time for a bidding war in the last ten seconds, you all just bid what you are willing to pay and the one with the highest wins. The main reason I snipe is because some idiot will do thirty bids to beat mine if they have time, but if they just bid without me they will only bid five dollars.
