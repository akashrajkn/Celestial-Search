Formspring quesiton..?
so i dont have a formspring, but i asked a question...i cant remember if i was logged in or out of facebook. im worried they will be able to figure out it's me through fb, even though i dont have a formspring account
can they?

No they can't see it if you don't have an account. Regardless of being logged in out of Facebook it doesn't matter because although the two sites are linked you need to create a formspring account before you can post the question and let them know who it's from. Yours will show up as anonymous.
