Can a public webpage be made into a copy?
I'm not sre if it was possible but a friend said they made one of their favorite websites by copying it and editing the pages in a different url leaving the original un harmed. She said that she was only using it with me and our group of friends only but I'm not sure. 

I have denied to register over and will tell her parents (yes we still have parents) if its illegal. 
She has in each page at least once " layout and graphics by www. (the website she copied) .com"  

I just don't want any one getting in trouble for participating in illegal act (if it is) so I'm keeping the url a secret

my question is: can someone legally copy a page and paste in in a secret url forever?

yes
