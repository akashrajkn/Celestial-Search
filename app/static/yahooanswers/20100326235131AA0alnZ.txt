When bidding on eBay?
If the item's end time is in (for example) five hours, and you place a bid on it, do you get it at the end time (if you are the winning bidder).
I'm very confused on how the bidding system works.

Help?

Yes it'll be yours at the end of the auction provided noone else bids higher then you.

You will if nobody else makes a bid higher than you within those 5 hours.

Thats why I bid within the last 5 minutes, if there are a lot of bidders. *wink*

Good luck.
