Any one use Ioffer.com?
Has any body had any good experiences with Ioffers.com and recommend me any good sellers? 
many thank
Jamie

i use it alot with no problems so far, but ive heard there is alot of scams on the site but aslong as you buy from a seller that has good feedback you should be fine. i normaly buy cheap copied movies and games from there, alot of other sites wont allow stuff like that. =)
