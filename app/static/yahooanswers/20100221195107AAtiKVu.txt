What else can I do online to keep from being bored?
I use twitter, facebook, myspace, youtube. I do my homework online. I shop and browse ebay and Amazon. I am running out of things to do help. O yea and listen to music and do yahoo answers. What do you do?

I play gamez. Newgrounds or.... playhub.
Play some online games, Pogo.com is my favorite place for games. It's free and once you create an account you rack up tokens and can enter daily, weeily, or monthly cash drawings. Their are many different types of games from puzzle to sports to cards and much more.

Maybe if you want to do something a little more productive you could read some blogs about whatever your interests are. I have an interest in design and it seems like their are millions of different design blogs out their, and I have really learned a lot from all of those free tutorials. I'm sure their are blogs out in the web about something you have an interest in learning more about.
If you want to join a website that lets you earn free amazon gift cards you could join through this link.

I've gotten $25 in gift cards and my boyfriend has gotten $25 too.
