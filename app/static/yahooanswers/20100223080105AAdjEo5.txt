The Spleak bots stopped working, Why?
I Heard About Spleak a few days ago, but then, i got to fact that ALL the Spleak bots Stopped Working, any idea why?
and is there any Chance they'll get to work again soon?

EDIT: 
"Spleak was an IM platform where users could publish and rate content. By the time it closed, it had existed in the form of six bots. It is currently not in use, and all of her bots are offline."
Operative words are: WAS & CLOSED, as in dead & gone. Has been for over a year.
