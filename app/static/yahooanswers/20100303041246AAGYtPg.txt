best sites to work as a webcam model/cam girl?
Hey I am working as a cam girl but the site i am now working with has a very low traffic so I need a better one.Thing is i don't get completely naked (just underwear) and don't show my face.Any sites you know that have high traffic and nonudity allowed? Thanks!

There are literally thousands of sites out there! And yea with your restrictions its hard. There are two things I would recommend.
1. Because of the non nude factor I would suggest you run a few smaller sites as they are less caring about the full nude factor you will deff want to note in your profile you don't do full nude. and use a program like split cam to work on multiple sites. One that i know of that permits this is www.iamacamgirl.com.
2. Work on Yahoo adult cam sites. These places work best for your situation. the customer contacts you on yahoo they purchase through the site and you can verify they got a block of time then you do the show on yahoo. you can normally customize your profile and state that you don't want to do nude or you only go to panties and you will be fine. The largest network I know of is www.yahoocamgirls.com they promote you over 10 sites at once so traffic is better then others. but not the same type of traffic, however they do have tools on how to get more traffic in the models area. which helps a lot!

Hope i helped :)
