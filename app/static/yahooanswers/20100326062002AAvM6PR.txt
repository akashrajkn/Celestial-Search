Why can't I log into lockerz?
I went to go login today and it said wrong email so after trying many times I changed my password and it's obviously in the system and I put the right password in. What's wrong?

why dont you ask them 
we dont know why a website didnt let you log in
It's a glorified pyramid scheme so it's bound to end in disaster. Most likely your user name and password has been removed off the server somehow, you will need to contact Lockerz directly.
