You shouldn't be asking strangers to follow you on Twitter; instead you should ask your friends and family to join and have them follow you.
Sorry but no.
You can get all the followers you want and make tons of money too with The Twitter Money Tree. Here's the link  http://bit.ly/avzs97 Go check it out!
