HELP! I Have Placed An Order On Amazon But I'm Not Sure How To Verify My Email Address?
And There Isn't A Link To Do So. Thank You In Advance To All Who Answer.

You should receive an email from Amazon with a link to click to verify your email address. If you haven't received the email, check your spam folder. If it's not in there, go to Amazon, look under account settings, find where you can change your email address. If you gave them the wrong address, change it and they'll resend the verification email. If they have the right address it will be marked unverified and there should be a link to resend the verification email.
usually u will receive a mail abt the product which u purchased, this will linked with a verfication mail... just clik that link to verify so simple, nothing to worry as well, if the server is down it might take 2-4hrs to receive the mail :)
