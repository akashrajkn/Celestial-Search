Safari,Opera or Chrome 

please tell why,please answer thank you

Safari or Chrome.

The WebKit core. Which one you choose is basically personal preference, as they'll keep taking from one another and getting faster at the same rate.

The Opera guys are tough, and they're good at making things fast, but there's really no marketshare. In four years, Chrome will supplant Internet Explorer as the most used browser, so I'd stick with a WebKit base (either Safari or Chrome) to ensure compatibility with emerging web standards.
Why is Firefox not on the list? For me, Firefox is the best. I've been using it since first version and I've seen how powerful it become. Try to see it yourself. It may not be the fastest but the most reliable and trusted to me. Just my opinion.
Firefox is the best browser, it's got tons of addons that add loads to the functionality to the browser.
Chrome crashes a lot (my experience!)
Opera is good too, you can give it a try too.
Safari too crashed a few times while i used it.
