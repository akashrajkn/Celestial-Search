What is the website where you can adopt a pet and put it in your signature on a forum?
I saw these on a forum a couple days ago but i forgot what website.  Its those things where you adopt an egg and people press to feed it and it eventually hatches etc...anyone know what the website to create one of those?

I don't know which one you're asking for specifically, but I know of something like it, and they're awfully adorable and fun :)

You can put them on a blog or website.  I'm not sure, but maybe you can put them in a signature as well!
