Can This Get Me In Real Trouble?
There is an internet forum that has abused me greatly and just to exact revenge, I'm going to spam in every single thread. Can this get me in trouble with the law or not? Thanks!

You may get banned .. Then you will want to get even for being banned.. Why not just stay away from that forum  ?     ~
i don't think it will get you in trouble with the law...
maybe you'll get banned from that website if you keep spamming
Of course not! But you will get banned, most likely.. Do a little extra payback incase they ban you...
