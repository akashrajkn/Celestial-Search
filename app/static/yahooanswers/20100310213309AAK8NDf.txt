Can intelius find someone from their past email address?
I have a friend I really want to find, and I only really know her past email address. I'm pretty sure she changed it but I put it into Intelius anyway and it came up with 3 results. Because it's a pay site i can't see it. I am willing to pay the money to get the information but can you find someone through their past email address or would I be wasting my money to get the information?

Intellius is a reliable site! Have you tried running the email address and their name through Google? What about through www.pipl.com
http://www.NonPublished.com is a better choice.

" Comments from one of our new customers"
Wow- thank you for your extremely quick and informative reply. I have to tell you that after dealing with other 'search' companies, you/your company are just unbelievably impressive when it comes to customer service. The fact that you have a telephone number that you actually answer right away. The fact that your services are really what they state that they are on the web site. I'm not sure how I found you but I'm sure glad that I did - just wish that I had found you sooner!

I recently had such a bad experience with http://www.Intelius.com that I actually filed a complaint with the BBB and their replies were so full of outright deception that the BBB ruled against them and my credit card company reversed the charge based on the same reason.

I have used several of the services and you go above and beyond. I am thoroughly thrilled with this service - it is so easy to use and has always worked great!

Once again, thank you for your fantastic customer service. I will make sure to spread the word about your site.

Thanks a bunch,

Trish
