Can i use my PayPal account to pay on eBay when...?
I've recently set up a paypal account which is linked with my debit card already and i decided to add funds into my paypal account by linking it with my bank account, although the verification hasnt gone through yet, can i use my paypal account whilst its at this stage and charge my debit card ? 


thanks

To make things easier, I always wait until one thing is paid in or out before doing anything else. That way you won't get overdrawn or have any other problems.
I'd wait for the bank verification, most merchants give you a few days after winning an auction to complete the purchase.  eBay/PayPal don't take long to verify yr acct.   That way the merchant knows you're exactly who you say you are.   It also gives you 2 ways to pay.   You can still use yr debit card, I use my visa debit card in preference to my verified bank acct.  If the funds aren't in yr debit card, then PP will use yr bank acct.   Ensure you press the debit card button whilst making purchases or PP automatically defaults to bank payments.  IDK whether you have debit fees fr yr bank acct?  Allow for those if you have them.  I choose my debit card as there are no 'direct debit fees' fr my banking institution.  Keep accurate records so you know exactly what you're spending.
Yes. I recently discovered a service that allows you to save 13% on your purchases on eBay. Visit this link
