What was the name of that site where you make those really cute asian photos?
My friend sent me a link of this site and it had all those asian pictures with decorative stuff around the frame/border of the pic. (It was a site mainly for girls) and my friend wants it, but i cant remember the site at all T_T. Basically, you would upload a photo and then add/edit stuff or decorations to your photo

Picnik, FotoFlexer or Lunapic are great all round web based and FREE editing tools. Adobe, makers of the expensive Photoshop, now has a free website version in Photoshop Express.  If you need/want more features downloading GIMP is a great options.  Still free, but you have to download the software. There are also free tools to add text blurbs, to make collages, to put your photo into other images. There are a number of tools that allow you to put the image of a face into other photos for some fun creations.  Check out the links below for more ideas.
