Why does Lisa Shea write so many reviews on Amazon?
I mean, it's like she's got a review listed on every single game and movie I look up. What's up with that? She's written over 1,600 reviews. I can't read about anything without seeing her name. What would possess a person to do that? 

She must spend every single waking moment playing video games and watching TV. Actually, I take that back. It's more like 90% of ther time is spent on the TV. The other 10% is spent writing reviews. WHY??? Is she trying to be the greatest, most popular reviewer in the universe or what? 

Also, how can she afford to buy all that stuff? In between all the TV and reviews, there's no way she has time to work!

Most of her reviews are not even very good, in terms of being entertaining. They're factual and accurately describe the product, but that's it. There's no passion, no excitement, no humor. I like to read reviews where people really go crazy. Why does she write? And why do I care?

Why, Lisa? Why???

Maybe it's her job.
