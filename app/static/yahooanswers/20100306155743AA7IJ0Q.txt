i just sold something on ebay and now im confused on what to do next?
Ok so someone bought something i was selling and now it says "Buyers have requested their payment total on 1item" im confused??? wht does this mean

Did you have the shipping in your listing? All they want is a invoice sent to them which you can generate from the item listing.
