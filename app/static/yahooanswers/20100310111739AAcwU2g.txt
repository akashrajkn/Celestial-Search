Has my IP address been found?
Some I'm being cyber stalked online by 3 nutjobs who are sending me death threats.  They are telling me they have found my IP address and home address through youtube.  Can they?
Tony, provided that information to who?

ip yes >home not unless you provided that information
yes, unless if you are using Proxy
I seriously doubt they can even get your IP address. Can you elaborate Tony?
