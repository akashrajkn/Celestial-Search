Does a person know if you download their pic of a social networking site such as bebo?
For example, if someone was to download a profile picture i uploaded, would i find out? Can i put a lock on it?

if its a download button then yes
right click save as then no
nope. u can't put a lock on it either.
if someone does copy and paste u will never know about it
unfortunately no and yes u can set ut profile to private so only the ppl u pick can see them
No. He or She doesn't find out.
