Can I use webcam with Skype if I'm not talking to anyone?
If I'm not talking to anyone I want to make sure I'm positioned right and i'm in the right angles and right light and to do my hair, lol. I want to do it before i video-call someone.


so how do i use webcam when i am not talking to anyone? thanks

There should be an option that allows you to test your webcam settings. It might be called Audio/Video settings or something of the sort.

It shows you what your webcam is picking up!
use a mirror lol

on on your computer you should have a program that runs your web cam don't know what kind you got so i can't help you much there

if you go into paint or yahoo messenger or msn you can open your web cam not talking to anyone and see your image and adjust the lighting and hair there.
if its logtech or Microsoft look for that in the programs 
otherwise thy paint and import image or yahoo messanger

The article from interVU.me called How To Use a Webcam (link below) answers these questions and more.  It tells you how to use the webcam to take pictures, make videos, and hold video chat.  It even recommends free software and a free webcam test site.
