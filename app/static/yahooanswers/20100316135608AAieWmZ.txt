I NEED A TON OF SWAGBUCKS!?
Help! Ahh! I want to get a big prize from there but it's practically impossible to get points. i have only gotten points for searching once. and i have had it for like a week. i dont know what to do, how do i get a BUNCH of points within a couple of months?? i cant do one of those hacks b/c i already have an account. is there anything else i could do to get thousands? help help help!

One little thing you can do is go to the special offers and then no obligation offers.  Just click skip until you are awarded some swagbucks.  Do this everyday.  Every little bit helps.  Also don't over search.  I find searching a few times every couple of hours is better.  Try to get as many referrals as you can get.  That is probably that fastest way to get swagbucks.

I know what you mean!
It's definitely hard to get a lot of points - I'm looking to get 7000 and I'm only at 700 :(
Good luck though - Make sure to refer people, check the "Special Offers", not search like crazy and look out for swag codes!

Also, REPLACE google and all those other search engines with SWAGBUCKS to make sure you make the most of the website.  Sometimes swagbucks doesn't have the best results so I'll search "google" in the swagbucks search engine just in case ;)  Little things help and will start to add up!
