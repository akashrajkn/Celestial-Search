Does it really work to forward an email to so many friends and receive a gift certificate to do so?
I receive an email from a friend for Applebee's that said I would be emailed a $50 gift certificate for forwarding the email to eight friends.  Is that possible?  How would it work and would it be safe?  I have my doubts, but how could anyone benefit from it?  Or it is just to make you look foolish. ;)

I doubt it's legitimate. But I wouldn't say it's to make people look "foolish." You ever go on a video site like Youtube and see all the people posting "Copy this to __ more videos or something bad will happen" and things similar to that? It's one person's way of getting on as many peoples' nerves as possible. 

Also, some advertisements like that are legit, you get what you're promised, but in exchange, they give your email, phone number, and address away to advertising companies, who FLOOD you with advertisements and spam.
IT"S NOT TRUE! Trust me!  First all, Applebee's didn't make it!  Second of all, even if they DID make it, they have NO way to track it to see how many times you forwarded it OR if you forwarded it at all.  It's just like those forward texts where it says "send this to 10 people then look at your wallpaper" nothing happens! Trust me! If you send it, nothing will happen. It was some dork who made it who was bored and had nothing better to do!
