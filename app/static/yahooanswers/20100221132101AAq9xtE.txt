What should I do? Ebay question need help?
Hey I bought something for my dad for his birthday on ebay. I talked to the seller and planned on paying with a money order. It has been over a week since I won the item and I have sent him several emails and have not received a response. His birthday is approaching and I'm not sure what to do. Is there a certain period in which the seller must give you the info to pay? I'm thinking of ordering one from someone else but what would happen with the one I already ordered? Could it be canceled or something since he never contacted me? I am also beginning to wonder if it would even be safe to send him a money order since he has not even responded to me yet. What do you suggest I do?
I haven't gotten his information from him and haven't sent the money order since I don't know where to send it.

Sorry but your on your own here. When buying from eBay you should ALWAYS use paypal because then you have a oney back guarantee for problems like this.Let's just hope you didnt pay TOO much.
I'm not sure what the period is that the seller has to send you the item but I do know it is much longer than a week. I think it might be like 2 weeks at the least. you have a while to go before you should worry that your not gonna get it. If you can and haven't sent the money order yet I'd highly suggest paying with pay pal so you can get your money back if he never sends it.
