On Chatroulette what are the forbidden words?
I typed in a word on Chatroulette and a message popped up saying that I typed a forbidden word and that I was not allowed to use the site for 10 minutes. It would be nice to have a list of words I can't type so I don't make the same mistake again.

Well, I just found out that c_ck is one of the forbidden words..  This is a new restriction just this evening (Sunday, Feb 28, 2010)  It sure would be nice if they would just keep the 9 year old kids out Chat Roulette.

Hint:  Just change browsers and you won't have to wait 10 minutes:  Use Internet Explorer or Mozilla FireFox or Safari or Chrome or Opera, etc.
add these:

ugly
boobs
b**bs
penises is a bad one.  As in I have seen way too many penises.
you can't say "penis"....i learned this the hard way as well.  it was kind of ironic considering i was saying "thank god you're not another penis"....haha oh well.
