From experience,which delivery service does Amazon Free Super Shipping use?
Ive never used Super Shipping before, do they ship fast and from which service UPS,USPS,FEDEX? Thank you in advance. =)

Usually the U. S. Postal Service, but mostly I've bought books. They might prefer FedEx for bigger items.
