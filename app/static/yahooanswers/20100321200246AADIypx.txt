Can't watch videos on Firefox?
I just installed Mozilla Firefox to my computer, and i cannot watch videos on it, or play flash games... I i can do those things on Internet Explorer, so i don't understand why i can't on Firefox.... please help
I know it's something with flashplayer, but i don't know what, i have it installed, and it works on internet explorer

you might not have flash installed.
install flash for firefox under firefox add on or go to adobe.com and download it from there
