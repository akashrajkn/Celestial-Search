How do I find every website I've ever signed up for?
I have been using the internet ever since 2000, signing up to sites and never ever going back to them again. I have also used other email accounts during the past which i were forgotten about. The problem is.... many sites usernames and email accounts etc have been forgotten, but is there a way i can somehow track all this down again? (I have used a number of different computers over the past).

I've heard of a website that can generate this list, but my google searches are not resulting in anything.

I never heard of anything like that, but sounds cool :D
You can always check your emails too
If you think about it, how would this so called website generate such a list if you can't even remember them?

Think just how many sites have come, gone and been taken over in the last 10 years for a start.

Most sites that have accounts with email addresses that have been dormant over specified time are just deleted. 

They don't keep them and waste space on their servers on the off chance that your going to come back after a year or two.
These sites will have left a cookie with you. Only way I can think of - however, I assume before your PC ground to a standstill, you deleted your browsing history. 

Your important sites you have probably added to your favourites/bookmarks - these would have been backed up if you changed hard drives.

Otherwise, keep an A-Z address book of your sites by your PC - note them down with passwords.
That would be handy... but a site like that would need your usernames and passwords which you said you forgot. ALSO it would be a virus looking to ruin your computer, or hack all your info.
