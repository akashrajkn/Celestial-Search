Will there eventually be 'Ad breaks' on the net, say two minutes before your chosen page appears?
Dismiss this lightly at your peril. Movies are already afoot to charge for online newspapers. 
Ad breaks are already first up on DVDs and in the cinema.

You already pay for internet use right? So to answer your question, NO.
some sites already have this and some on line videos  featured in newspaper sites have this also.

Many sites have pop up ads that virtually obliterate the page - they are programmed so that the ads can stay a second or two after you click on the close box.
