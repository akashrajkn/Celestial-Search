I have a question using twitter?
Lets say I wanted to ask someone a question, would that person have to be following me to see that question?

Just put @whomever and theyll see the question
No, the person does not need to be following you.  As long as you put the "@" in front of the persons twitter name. For instance, if you wanted to send me a question you would start the twitter with @carlt.  Then I would see the twitter.  But don't forget anyone following you will see the twitter you send as well.
no, just click on their name, but if you want to send Private Messages, then yes.

Worse case scenario, if the person your sending your question too, may have loads of followers. So there's every chance they may not have the time to respond to your question, as lots of other people may also be asking them questions.

Twitter should be seen more as a place to stick up notices to divert people to news stories or your site like YOU TUBE when you stick up a new vid you want your followers to see. Twitter only gives you 140 characters to write with & a URL can be huge.... ;) Though PM may be longer i never use it?
hi yes i seen the best program you to see who can see your question it Twitter power tool's
