Does it keep telling you that firefox is unsafe and that it is running a scan and finding viruses? It looks like a windows program. The only way to get rid of it is to buy, install and run malware. It costs about $50.00. I hated this virus as it's one of the most difficult to get rid of.
Is it Firefox that keeps popping up or a pop up Window. If it's a pop up Window, it probably isn't Firefox causing this. Scan for Malware, not virus scan.
