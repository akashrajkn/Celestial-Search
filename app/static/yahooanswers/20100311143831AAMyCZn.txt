Anyway to find my friends AIM screename?
My friends AIM screen name was his last name with 3 numbers in the end of his name. I deleted him by accident and were in a fight so i don't want to ask him. Plus non of my friends have his screen name. Is there a search engine that can find his screen name?

there is no search engine that can do that but you can search for a buddy by name or email if you press ctrl+s. 

also you can look at the recent people you IMed by click on a person's screename, then click on the little drop down arrow to see the recent sns you IMed or looked at a profile on.
there is one. its the add a contact button. It will tell you "if you do not now the full a.i.m name please put in the persons email. its on everything including skype ,myspace, aol yahoo and more but not written this specific way
