how do you send an email at a later time?
I am trying to send an email and have it delivered at a later time.
im looking for something more like if i write an email and send the message today. the email will get delivered at a specified date/time. i found one site which is www.timecave.com but I was looking to see if there were more sites out there that had more options.

you can save it in drafts and send it later
save it as a draft then send it later
I dont know of a way of doing that as it goes as soon as you click send.There are programs like e cards and happy birthday .com where you can send cards and add messages and type the date and time you want them to send it. Try this site~~
