Is there any were, on the internet I can download Beatles Mono Remastered Box Set for free.?
I have tried loads of torrent sites (like pirate bay and isohunt) but non of them have given me anything good. Just wondering if there was a place that was better or if I could directly download it form another site. I have heard the stereo versions and I really like them. But people have told me the mono versions are better. I just want to listen to the difference.

Try Spotify if that helps x
hey I've got an idea,  copy your stereo cd to mono in an audio transformation app, I use Mac so handbrake would be good for that.. 

for M$ google is your friend..
