What is that sound from the laptop when i click on my mozilla firefox icon too many times at one go?
sometimes, when i turn on my computer and then click on the Mozilla Firefox icon, in a rush i tend to click on it too many times at one time, then there would be that sound 'peeepp' or whatever sound that i cant describe which is quite loud. do u all get that too?
