how to promote my site£¿?
I made a site about learning Chinese, and now i want to do something to promote it. I just want to make more persons to know it, especially to the persons who want to learn Chinese. Is there anyone who knows about promoting a website? Please tell me the method. By the way, my site is www.mychineseol.com.

Make sure that the site is decent and that people will find it useful, that way when people do find it they will come back or recommend it.
also - ensure that the site is standards-compliant, then submit sitemaps to Google, Bing and Yahoo.
Use helpful titles and H1 tags and people will find the site via search engines.
also tell people you meet about the site, and mention it in a blog and facebook.  twittering about it wont do you any harm...
