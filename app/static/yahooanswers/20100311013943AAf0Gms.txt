How can I stop Internet Explorer displaying history in new tabs?
I know how to delete the history afterwards, but how do I prevent the history being shown in the first place? I have Internet Explorer 8 and whenever I open a new tab, the page always shows the history under the guise of: "View tabs that you've closed since starting Internet Explorer." Without even trying, anyone can see exactly what I've been looking at. How can I stop it showing a list or previously visited websites? The information is quite detailed; for example, it doesn't just show answers.yahoo.com; rather it shows the exact title of the question I was looking at. Bah, it's annoying the h*ll out of me. Thanks.
I tried browsing  using the "InPrivate" function but it doesn't solve the problem.
I don't have google toolbar; the problem is with internet explorer 8 itself.

use firefox instead. and choose to never remember history. nothing will ever be saved.
or look for a similar setting in internet explorer.
Open your internet explore, go to internet options in general tabs on browsing history click setting
Then set Temporary internet file to never and day to keep history set to 0
Go into Tools>Internet Options>Tabs>Settings
From there you can control what the new tab opens with.

For future reference, check out InPrivate Browsing, a feature that allows you to browse without leaving a trace:
