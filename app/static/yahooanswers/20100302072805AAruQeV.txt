I'm using PC but have no internet connection. I just want to know some sites which provide free downloads that i can use... For example, where can i download an entire novel free of cost & then can i study in home later ?
Or i even want to download study materials {I'm doing 2nd yr production engg.} in browsing center & then later i can study at home...

Also post links or sites that give free download of software, playstation games, PC applications etc. or whatever, i just want sites or links giving me free download stuffs....
Please post me whatever you know !!!
{ mainly i want links for study materials, novels, softwares & games}

In scribd,you've to register to download materials.
Free S/W and games are generally available through torrents.Or even you can search rapidshare search engines like http://megadownload.net,but they provide slow downloads.Better use torrents.
