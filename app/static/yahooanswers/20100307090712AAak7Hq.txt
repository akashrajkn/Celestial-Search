Should I use internet explorer 8, mozilla firefox 3.6, google chrome, or opera 10.50?
Which internet browser should I use?
which one is the fastest?
Which one is the most secure.

Use Safari. Failing that, Chrome.
Safari probably. Don't use internet explorer, it's slow. Firefox is ok. I haven't tried Chrome or opera. I would go with safari for sure.
