Is there a UK version of Etsy?
www.etsy.com

Is there a UK verson, or any similar website based in the UK?
(they sell handmade goods, etc, from lots of different sellers)

Thankyou

I don't know of any, but the US-based etsy site IS international. There are seller's there from all over the world -- and buyers as well. My very first sale was to a person in Spain -- and I'm in the US.
