How do you chat to people on Twitter?


why bother?
you need to build a friends base.. 

or make new friends on a internet community . take a look here http:///torrentzone.net
I found Twitter a bit crap at first and hard to use. If you want to improve your Twitter experience don't use the website, but download a Twitter client like Tweetdeck. This will cut out all the crap on there you don't want, like foreign messages you can't understand. Use it to filter messages for the content you want, and build a list of followers and people you follow. You can send someone a message by putting there name "@name" in your tweet. It can come in useful. Lots of universities now make announcements on Twitter, so put the site on your phone to stay up to date.
