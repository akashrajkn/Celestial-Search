idea for my website, i need your opinion please?
I am making a social networking/chatscript and i had a small idea about how to get people to join and would like your opinion on this

I was thinking about giving every member a trial membership for lets say 30 days
in those 30 days you will have to invite atleast 5 people and 1 of them has to join atleast

otherwise your account will be suspended..

do you think this wil work?
its not really a trick to make ppl to join but more a way of advertising
to phil, you dont pay for it, you just contribute by advertising

I have a question: why would people want to join your website?  What does it have that others don't?
not if you make them invite 5 people and have one have to join >if the site is good people will join
I don't think it will work. People prefer choice rathr than being told what to do and face a consequence if they fail to do so.
Forget it theres too many high profile sites doint it already your site will go nowhere
I think thats a great idea but there are an awful lot of social networking sites out there that are free already. What makes yours so special that people would want to pay for it??
Okay men. I think this will not work. It's not a good plan, brother. 1st of all, even you or me doesn't  want a kind of social network. Just invite others to join the social network. Just let them decide and it's there own if they want or not. Or if you really want try to advertise with some advertising website. Hope it helps.
