U SHOULD OF SOLD IT ONCE YOU GOT CLEAR PAYMENT
                                                                           ----------
                                                                           ----------
Just hope you haven't sent the IPod yet? It will probably be in your bank early next week.
Once shipment has been confirmed amazon make you wait 14 days if you are a new seller (to make sure you are not ripping people off) before they send the money to your bank account. You will receive an email from them telling you how much is being sent to your account and then it takes 3 or 4 days to arrive depending upon which bank you are with. More details on link:
