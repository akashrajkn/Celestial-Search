Use Firefox.
Use whatever else than IE, there are so many possibilieties and they are much better in all ways...

Try out Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome... I am sure that you will find something that fits you best. I prefer Firefox for security and friendly GUI.
If you want to open the link on a new tab, press the Ctrl key while you click on the link.
stop using IE 
Install Apple Safari,it rules!! It's much faster than Firefox.
P.S don't use Chrome,its all hype and it lacks security!!
I'm a browser expert,so you can count on me :)
Use Safari
