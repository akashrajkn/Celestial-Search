Download suddenly freezes?
i am downloading then it freezes. i have to start the download again. why is that?

1.Are you using any proxy services?
2.is your connection Clean?i mean check that it doesn't have noises.
3.it might be from the site that you're downloading from, check if it happens in every downloading.
4.you can use softwares like Flash Get that you can pause/ start / stop and do whatever you wanna do, and disconnections, delays, and other staffs wont make the download crashed!
;)
try downloading the file with IDM download manager it may prevent the download freezing have fun
