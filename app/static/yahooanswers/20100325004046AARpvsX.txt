What is a good site to find people with little information?
I am trying to find someone but I have very little info about this person.  I have tried all the social networking sites, the free people search sites but have come up empty.  I'm pretty sure she got married but I have no idea what her married name is.  I know the state and county she lived in and wondered if there was a site that I could go into that would give me information on residents of that county.  I don't mind paying for a site if it REALLY works.  Does anyone have any suggestions of where I could look?  Also, have you tried the site you are suggesting and what did you think of the site? Thx.
Yohan - I have already done this but thanks.

it works
very simple, go to integrascan.com first and search under her maiden name. In the results Look for an old address that you remember for her.....It may reveal her new name....next you can go to whitepages.com and find all kinds of info
