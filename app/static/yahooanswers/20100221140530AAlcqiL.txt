Swagbucks Referral question?
On Swagbucks, If i referred a friend, and they referred other people, would I get the swagbucks they made for referring those people

no you wont, i use to use swagbucks but it takes so dang long, so i went to this news site where all you do is watch videos answer daily polls, and you get points for that. you also get points for inviting people and just for logging in to the site. on swagbucks you get lik 1-2 points daily on this site you get 4-8 daily. heres a video with a better description check it out. if u become interested email me with your email and ill invite you to the site since you can only join if you get invited.

Nope, sorry. Only the people who use YOUR referral link give your their first 100 bucks.
