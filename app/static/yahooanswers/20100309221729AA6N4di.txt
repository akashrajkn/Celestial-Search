Computer shows that internet is working but get DNS failure on every website I try?
I can get my internet icon to indicate that I have an internet signal. It even says that I am online when I go into network properties, but if I try to open a web page it tells me that there was a DNS failure indicating that it could not find the DNS server. How do I fix this? Thank you.

If you have Norton - try to turn it on or uninstall it. In another case - contact you Internet Service Provider.
sounds like everything is working but your not contacting your service provider, try running your internet cd again, they could just be down too, someone near me took out a phone pole i had no internet a few days
1. Try power cycling your modem (and router), or use the reset button.

2. Call your ISP to see if there is a service disruption.

3. Check for viruses. The newer ones can disrupt your Internet settings.
