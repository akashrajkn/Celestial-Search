Why won't Peggle online work on my computer?
Last Saturday, Popcap's version of Peggle stopped working. It hasn't worked since. Help?

Two possible reasons:

1. Are you running a new firewall or port blocker like Peer Guardian or Peer Blocker? I know I can't run MapleStory with Peer Blocker running.

2. Did you recently update Flash? I've had a few older Flash based games bookmarked that don't work anymore with newer versions of Flash.

Hope that helps!
