Firefox and CPU spike.?
Firefox is a decent browser to use but I've come to the point where I can't really use it anymore because it spikes my CPU up to 100% and stays there for quite a while. When it's not at 100% it's around like 80% or so. It's really annoying especially when I am just browsing sites or trying to watch a video and everything just locks up. Once I close Firefox my CPU will come right back down. Anyone have any insight? And please don't tell me to download another browser. Been there, done that.

Perhaps maybe your internet router is slow.
