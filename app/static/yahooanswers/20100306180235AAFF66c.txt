Why Is my Internet Explorer Toolbar Gone?
The toolbar where you put in internet addresses is gone, my little cuz started smashing my keyboard, now its gone. I fixed it before but now i dont remember. When I roll my mouse over it a mini version appears, how do I get it to stay. Im using Internet Explorer 8, on a Toshiba Satalitte Laptop

go where it say's view at the top then click toolbars and it should be in there.
Try "F11". Hitting "F11" can get rid of the bars at the top and bottom of your screen, allowing for a fullscreen view of your internet browser. Simple fix.
An easy fix this is to right click the area where your navigation bar (the technical term for it) should be. Just right click and click on Navigation toolbar. 
There you go!
