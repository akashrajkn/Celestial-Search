Is buying from users on Amazon reliable?
if i wanted to buy a 'new' item from a user, is it really new? like it hasn't been opened new? i know you can get used in 'like new' condition according to the users, but is it really reliable?

amazon is very reliable
Ive had good luck so far with books.
stop worrying lol, its fine for me and the other million people who've done it
Don't know what you mean by a "user" on Amazon.  Amazon sells both directly and through "associated" retailers.  I buy from Amazon regularly and have never had problems.
Yes, they're reliable, and if you get stung in a user deal, just report it to Amazon's management and they'll refund your money.

The only problem I've had over there is that Amazon's private user sellers often list their merchandise on several websites, like eBay and others, and then, if the item sells somewhere else, they don't bother to remove the listing from Amazon, so on several occasions I've had my order cancelled because the item is no longer available, which is very annoying and frustrating and a total waste of time, too!

Good luck!...
Amazon is usually pretty good at using reputable companies. Now I have heard of bad business being done as well. Amazon does its best to make good on the situation though. 

If you are not trusting enough to do business online, then I would recommend purchasing the item directly from a retail store. You may pay a few more dollars but you will have the satisfaction of being able to take it right back to the store if it doesn't work.
