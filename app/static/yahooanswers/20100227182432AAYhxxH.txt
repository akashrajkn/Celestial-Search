Formspring Question, Important!!?
If someone posts a link to their formspring account on their facebook, and I click on that link and ask them a question, do they know it's me if I don't have a formspring account?
That One Girl, THANK GOD, I asked some awkward questions that I'm hoping were definitely anonymous.

Nope. If you don't have a formspring account, regardless of facebook, it's completely anonymous. (:
