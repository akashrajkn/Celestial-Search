If I click on a bit.ly link, am I being tracked?
A few of my friends have been posting "bit.ly" links on Facebook. Will my friends know when I've clicked on the link? I know that bit.ly tracks the number of clicks, but will my friends know WHO is clicking the links?
I understand that bit.ly or some other 3rd party could be tracking me... that's a whole different issue. I also understand the danger of internet hackers--though I seriously doubt any of my friends are one. My question is in reference to bit.ly itself-- is this site designed to help people track who is clicking their links?????

Your friends probably won't, but SOMEbody will.
Maybe yes if they're clever 'crackers'
