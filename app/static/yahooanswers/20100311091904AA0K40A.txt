For web hosting that includes the domain name (for free), do I still own the name and can I transfer it later?


yes
Yes, hosting and domain name service are two different things. You need to know if the domain is actually registered to you, or to your hosting company. Many hosting companies will register the domain to themselves, and if you ever want to transfer it you will need to contact your hosting provider (and possibly pay them) to get them to transfer it into your name, then you can do whatever you want with it. If it is registered in your name, you can do what you want with it but you will need to pay the domain service provider when it's time to renew.
Yeah I just love when you talk all hot and bothered.
Yes.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Hope this helps.
The webhosting is much more expensive than the domain name, but it is the domain name that has the traffic value further down the track. 
Sometimes you will own the domain name, other times you will not - check the terms and conditions
If you just buy your own domain name (or even get a free one) you can then get it hosted for free.

As far as I can tell, it depends on the agreement. From all I have researched about domains, in my opinion, you're better off paying for a domain name of your own. 
Domains aren't that expensive... honest.
You should be able to but be careful and read the terms and conditions.
