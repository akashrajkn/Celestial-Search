What can we do to make our connection better?
Im not sure what type of connection we have but it has a cable that plugs into a router. My brothers and I would like to play Xbox live with each other but each time one us receives 'Cannot connect' or ' Lost connection'. I was thinking about maybe a better router will make it better but I don't know. What can we do to make our connection better?

Better router, get a netgear g-max router they work good, or you can also buy the new upgraded wifi-adaptor for the 360 (it has 2 antenas and it is black i think)
