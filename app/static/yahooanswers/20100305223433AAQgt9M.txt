Amazon issue, can anyone help?
ok so i was ordering something from "Amazon"(duh) and when i clicked place order on the next page there was a "important message" saying the price of (blank) has changed since it was added to my 
cart (down 86 cents wow) and on the side of the screen it was saying "ready to order?" with "my" order in "shopping cart items--to buy now. i got curies and checked "my account/your orders" and it said ... (suspense)  NOTHING it said there no orders placed. so is this a glitch? did the order not get placed? did the order get placed? WHAT HAPPENED??? >.<
if i buy something online i usually get it off amazon and when ordering i did what i have done countless times added the item(s) to my cart clicked proceed to checkout checked credit card info selected the shipping style that i wanted looked over the ALL the info clicked "place order" then the message popped up i checked "my" shipping records and nothing  
P.S. if you don't like the question then... DON'T ANSWER IT

amazon can suck ma nutz
Stupid question.. but did follow thru with ordering or just go directly to "My orders". It sounds like you didn't finish checking out.
