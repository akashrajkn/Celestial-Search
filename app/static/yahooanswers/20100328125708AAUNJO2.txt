Bad idea: Downloading music on the web

''Its called the Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, and it sets out to enforce intellectual property rights across the world. If you download music, movies, books or anything else copyrighted, ACTA will provide the legal framework to go after internet service providers and potentially shut off your internet connection. The agreement is shrouded in secrecy, but James Love, Director of Knowledge Ecology International is with Alyona to provide details. ''

in this interview by russia today the guy is saying that america is going to enforce a world wide law , even in europe - of if you get caught downloading anything illegally like film or music , your ISP ( internet service provider ) will cut you off from the internet forever.

this news headline depressed me quite a bit as i am from england .

any comments ? 


and what would the people do that have material already on their computer, like music, films etc ?

do i face being cut off from the net ?
and:

have all british ISPS agreed to this law ,  to cut people off from the internet ?

USA is trying to be a world bully again.

China and Russia will simply ignore it.  And most other countries, except other USA toadies (unfortunately Canada is one) will also ignore it or publically denounce it.

I can see Venezuela telling the USA to screw off.
These so called recording companies, film distribution companies are blowing trumpets since a few years about piracy and still they could not do an inch about anything.

which means ppl will upload stuff illegally and ppl will download stuff illegally.

make sure u never ever upload anything so that others can download...ppl who upload are the targets for piracy
