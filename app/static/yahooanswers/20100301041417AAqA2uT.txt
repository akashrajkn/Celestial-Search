how do you know if your twitter account is being block?


By simple reasoning ~
If they have blocked you , the best course of action is to just deal with it.
It is up to them who to have on their account and if they don't want you then they are not a very good friend.
Move on lots of other good people in the world.

I was once told

I can't make people like you but i can ask them to tolerate you
