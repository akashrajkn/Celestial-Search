Can I run 2 anti-virus programs on the same PC?
My internet provider offers anti-virus protection that I will need to download soon if I want it for free. I already have a professional grade program that I do not want to remove. Can I also install the free one as a backup until my professional grade program expires and run both in the mean time?

No, as they could conflict and cause BSoD's/slowdowns etc
idoobackup software have a free version.
