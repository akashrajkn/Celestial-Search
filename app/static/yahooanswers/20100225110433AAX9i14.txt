Do you think this Orange wireless internet is a fair price...?
Im switching phones to Orange anyway....so it would cost ?4.89 a month...

Do you think thats a fair price to pay...?
Does anyone else have it....what do you think?
I spend about 5hrs a day on the internet...so would that cover it..

the most would be 5hrs...monday-friday about 3hrs.

LOL....500MB for a Fiver and you want to spend 5 hours a day on the internet ...you have no chance !!!

  Mobile Broadband is a rip off ....With most Mobile Broadband it comes with at least 1GB per month but be warned , go over that limit each month and it will end up costing you a pretty penny ...
