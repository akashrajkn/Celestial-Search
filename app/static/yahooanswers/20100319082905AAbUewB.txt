More Funny than Wrong or More Wrong than Funny?
Just for kicks, I'm thinking about creating a fake dating profile and uploading some pics of a really hot male model just to see what kind of responses I get from women.  I woudn't respond or lead them on or anything.  I'm not that cruel.  Would this be funny as hell or over the line, or both, or neither?
Mind you, I would not solicit any contact or respond to any contacts.  So, there no playing with emotions going on here.

Neither ?_?
funny lol tell us how it goes!!!!!!!!1
I guess you are a young man. For a matured netizen, or as a man/woman of sense, all that on the internet are jokes, chances and pitfalls at the same time. And mostly jokes...
But to the less experenced...so, your way of response is what make things different...
