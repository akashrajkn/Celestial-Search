why do my web searched fail to load the first time; "server not found", but load the second time?
use win xp, firefox all updated avg antivirus. this issue usually happens to websites i haven't been too. ill click the site, takes awhile to load then the server not found message comes up

Try uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox again. get the latest version of Firefox from the website. lternatives.Does it only happen with firefox? IE 8 is good. And google chrome is also fast. for alternatives.
