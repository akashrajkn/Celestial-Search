How do you make these sort of website things?

My friend sent me that.
I see links like that all the time though.
With customized stuff when you click.
Where do you do that?

You need to learn HTML, Javascript, CSS, and a server-side programming language like PHP, Python, or Ruby. Once you know how to program, you just open up a text editor and write your code. There is no program that can do it for you.
