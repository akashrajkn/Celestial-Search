Weird Internet Problem?
I have Windows XP on my comp
but sometimes when I'm online XP will go away and it will switch back to an old version,

And no warning or window pops up saying anything
it'll just automatically change, then change back after a couple of mins

Anyone know whats wrong w/ it?
And how I should fix it?
Thanx :)
It changes from Windows XP to the old version of windows

What will switch to an old version of what? It's hard to understand your question.
