Does it cost anything to post a sale on ebay?
I have never sold on ebay and want to know if it costs anything to post a sale on ebay or if they charge once you've sold the item.

Thanks.

no it does not cost anything
Yes from about 50 - 75p I think, but if you want to add extras to the listing, such as more photos or better design it will be more. They charge you as soon as you put it on, whether or not you sold it.
No, no. Not at all, eBay get's their money from advertisers on the site, not commissions or royalties. I've sold on eBay 3 times before and never got charged. And anyways, eBay would tell you if they would charge you, it's against the law to charge a card without user's consent.
Yes it does.

They charge if you sell the item. No fees if you didn't sell it. To those that are saying it's free, then why do they send out billing statements?
Both,  you pay Ebay an insertion fee to put the auction on, this varies according to how much you set your starting bid and if its an auction or "buy it now". This has to be paid even if the item does not sell but you can relist your item and if it sells the 2nd time you don't pay the insertion fee again. 

If it sells then you also have to pay Ebay a Final Value fee which is a percentage of the selling price around 5%. If you accept Paypal payments you will pay a Paypal fee too, usually 4% of the sale price.  

The Ebay fees have to be paid once a month, they notify you when they are due, you don't pay each time you list an item its totalled up for the month and your credit/debit cards gets debited with the fees. 

For low price items its hardly worth bothering selling them once all the fees have been deducted.  Before you start selling read the help pages, it is not as simple as it looks.
