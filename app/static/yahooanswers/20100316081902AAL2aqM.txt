Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?
here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item, then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?
thanks for all the input. and no it is a 15000$ camera that are used at stadium football games. so 5000$ was a great buy.

5thou for a camera, why didn't u buy one at the store?
Contact ebay...isn't there buyer's insurance? Or even a guarantee on items that expensive?
go through the process of mailing e-bay about the problem they should have his name number and address and should fix it or send you the money back 
p.s. why would you buy a camera for 5k? when you could buy them for around 300
i'm so sorry that happened. You should contact ebay and tell them the story when you sign up for ebay you need alot of information so ebay could track the person down and eventually get your money back
With that much cash, you could have bought, that cam at any store!!!!!!!
But, just as the others said, just contact ebay, they might pay you back your cash!!!!!!!
