Why do people troll on the Internet?
Some people just say the stupidest stuff, what is the point?

they can't finish their money.
It's fun.
They hate their lives and they want you to hate yours too
lol they either are just doing it as a joke. a lot of times it's just because they think differently and feel that what they have to say is important. it's stupid, but it's true lol
sometime people will go on internet and complain about everthing 
sometime alot of people will take the internet wayyyy to seriously
