Is Clear any good? Is it any better than clearwire?
1.Can I play xbox live with clear?(they advertised gaming on the go on a laptop)

2. Is the whole wimax thing really much of an improvement from clearwire.

3. When will wimax(still dont understand what this is so someone please explain this to me.) come out in Jacksonville, FL.

4. Are there any extra fees if you switch from clearwire equipment to clear wimax equipment.

i thought clear and clearwire were the same thing  IT SUCKS
Don't get cleariwre. Their internet is really slow and i'm looking forward to their bankruptcy in 3 years.
