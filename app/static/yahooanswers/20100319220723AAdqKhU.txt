Why does everybody believe that you have wireless internet?
Whenever I post a question on any forum or question & answer site about my WIRED internet, I always get answers referring to WIRELESS internet. Why? Is WIRELESS internet used by absolutely everybody or something?

Because only a complete mongoloid would have issues with his wired connection.
yeah, wires are so yesterday,
i use wired >since it is more secure than wireless
On a site like this it's because you get responses from people like me who barely change even a single word from what I may have written ten minutes earlier in response to more or less the same question. It's out of the laziness or stupidity of the person answering your question, nothing more. In my case, I must emphasize, it's mostly the former, though perhaps a minimal bit of the latter must occasionally be thrown into the equation as well.

On a real tech support forum though, you should expect a higher level of expertise and attention to detail from the people responding to your question. At least as long as the answer to your question wasn't already in a sticky or FAQ somewhere, you really do deserve to be shown at least the courtesy of having people read your question and comprehend it properly before responding.
