can you safely delete internet explorer to use mozilla firefox?
a friend recommended firefox to me so i can use tor, i use internet explorer now, its there a safe way where i can delete internet explorer without messing up anything?

I would use something safer, and faster, such as Chrome or Safari.
download firefox, then drag IE into the trash.
Control panel will remove it, but you do not have to. I have both browser installed on my computer, so if it were me I would leave internet explorer on the computer. It doesn;t take up much room and certain sites will not work on firefox.
Depends on your OS...if it is Vista....you cant...I know you can do it for all earlier operating systems....Not sure with windows 7.
Just leave explorer on your pc and use explorer, it's not hurting anything.  I hated firefox after about a month.
Internet Explorer is integrated into the Window's operating system, so no you can't safely delete it.

You can set Firefox as your default browser so IE is basically hidden. On Windows 7 and I think Vista, click Start, and go to Default Programs. Then click set your default programs, select Firefox, and finally click Set this Program as Default.

Now every file that Firefox can open (like saved web pages) will open in Firefox automatically instead of IE
