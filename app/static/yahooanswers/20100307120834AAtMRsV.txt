When chatting with a stranger, how do you know if male or female?


you could ask them! thanks! hope i could help :)
Ask.
No. You can't possibly be that stupid. Your brain couldn't function elsewhere in society.

YOU ASK THEM. WHY NOT ASK. ASKING. TYPING WORDS IN A MANNER THAT WILL ELICT THE DESIRED RESPONSE.
well if its on yahoo look at there avatar pic if they dont have one then idk ask them?
Despite the obvious way and what everyone else said, you really don't. If you ask me what I am, and I say I'm a woman (which I'm not), how are you ever going to know unless you meet me? And if tell you that and we wind up meeting, then you have an ever bigger problem.
It can be hard to judge who is who online. Asking is not a 100% solution either.  For security purposes, a woman might pretend to be a male while online and next we have the freaks and or the Trolls. So, you are left with your native intuition which is reliable if you listen and use it...
ask or ask them a personal gender question
on chatroulette? or just generally?
asking helps.
