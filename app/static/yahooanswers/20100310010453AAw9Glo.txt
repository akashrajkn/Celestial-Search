TUMBLR!

or blogspot.
www.blogger.com. It's powered by google and also integrates with AdSense that allows you to earn money if blog is useful and attracts a lot of visitors. Good Luck!!
you can use the myspace, yahoo paid linking, facebook, dmoz, digg and propeller etc.
You can use google blogspot or wordpress.com to start your blog. These two are most popular at this time.
Depending on what you like,

Tumblr is great for blogging allowing you to do a lot and its easy to upload photos etc.
It is more socially based and isn't taken as seriously (if that makes sense) and boy is it good looking. With Tumblr you get hits all at one time then suddenly it can just die down.

Blogger is also great, harder to customise. Looks more professional but its harder to upload different media onto it and it plain doesn't look as good. Blogger usually gets a spaced out amount of hits, a few here and there and if people like your stuff more and more, views go up and stay up.

You could also use MySpace or others but those two are to me the best.

Personally I use Tumblr.
Blogspot is best. If u have a gmail id, go to ur account and select blogger create ur blog easily and put ads on ur blog to earn from them. For more details visit my site and blogs.
