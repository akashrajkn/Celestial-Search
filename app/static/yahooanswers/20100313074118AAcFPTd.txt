At the First a Virus could be found on your computer, but before it,
Need to check this options, then go for the antivirus program to install nd clean the virus, if problem remain on your compputer,

Please Click on Internet Explorer Icon PROPERTIES on your desktop without running it
then click on Connections see if any kind of seting are there before removing these check all these setting match with your internet Service provider setting, of IP Protocols and etc...
if all these settings are properly, then Delete History and Click the POPUP Blocker uncheck or OFF it.

If problem is there then contact with me.
