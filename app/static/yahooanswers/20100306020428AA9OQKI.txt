Easy Twitter question?
I'm new to Twitter, so I'm not familiar with much.
I was wondering, when someone talks to you, like "@[your username]" how can you tell?  Do you get notified somehow?
I never see that people are trying to talk to me until I search my username.
How can I tell when someones talking to me?

Sorry, I'm a newbie.

When you log in and your on the home page,
on the side bar you will see @[your username] 
click on that and all the people who are trying to
talk to you will be in there 
i hope i helped =)
