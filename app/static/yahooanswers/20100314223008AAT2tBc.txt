how do I do auto bidding on ebay?
I was going to buy a cell & started bidding when there was likem 5 min left against 1 other person, but every time I entered a bid it IMMEDIATELY out bid me- like at a pace that was too fast for a person to be doing
how do I set that up?

Bid the maximum amount you are willing to spend!
Check out bidslammer on google.
You pay a certain amount (cheap) and u'll always win. It can bid at the last 3 seconds. My dad always used to use it
The other person put in a "proxy bid", which is a hidden high bid.

Say he bid $10, but it only shows him at $2.

So you bid $3... and ebay instantly bumps him up to $4.

You bid $5, and ebay bumps him up to $6.

And so on until he is at his highest bid ($10 in this case).

So... it's ebay bumping up his bids. The other guy isn't sitting there doing it.
Bid your max bid in the last 10-15 seconds,   that's the  secret.
