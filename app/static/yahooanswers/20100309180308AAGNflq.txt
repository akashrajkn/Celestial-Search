Sometimes it just depends on your computer, try deleting your cookies. here's how:

1.) Open Internet Explorer and click on the "Tools" menu. 
2.) In the "Tools" menu, click on "Internet Options". 
3.) The Internet Options pop-up window appears. 
4.) Under the General Tab select the "Delete Cookies" button. 
5.) Delete cookies by clicking "OK".

And I think you should be at LEAST 13 years old. There are some nasty people on there lol ;D
