http://www.spicybids.com seems to be another pennyauction website. They have sprung up recent years and have become hugely popular. The key point of these types of auction sites is that you have to purchase bids before bidding and if you don¡¯t win the auction you will loose the money invested in bids. Therefore one should be aware of his bidding practices as the bids are not refundable. Money users spend on bids allows website owner to sell products under the recommended retail price.

I found an article in the web that sums it all up about this website: http://www.SpicyBidsScam.com
Ive won a few small things, freebids mostly, but I also won a iPhone. So it is real.
