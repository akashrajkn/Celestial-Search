can i change my account name on playlist.com?
my account name includes my ex bf's name and i want to change it (cuz he's a jerk)
anyone know way to change it?
ok so how do i change the display name?

No. You have to create an entirely new account, if you want a new username.
But I think you can change the display name.
The Way You Change Your Display Name Is By Going To Dashboard - Then Account - The First Line Is Username - Change It There Then Scroll All The Way to The Bottom and Save
