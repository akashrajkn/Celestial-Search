i have a question lets see if it makes sense.?
well i was copying something online and then all of a sudden i copied something else. and i totally forgot that i copied before and didnt paste it. so i go back and the document was now completely changed so i can't copy what i had before. is it possible that i can somehow get what i copied before by reversing something?

ps. i need a serious answer and no rude comments.

NO
Ctrl Z usually does the trick..
sorry, but no and it's not in your hard drive either :(
