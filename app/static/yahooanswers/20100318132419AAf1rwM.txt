I can't display my images as their real size on DeviantArt anymore!?
There used to be an option when you upload a artwork to DeviantArt where you could choose the size of the image when someone views it in fullview.

But now I don't see that option anymore, and I just submitted a tutorial that people need to read. Now the only way they can read it is by downloading it, but I just want to it to show the real size of the image in fullview, but I really can not find that option anymore!

Has it been removed? Or has it only been moved and I can not see it?

I would have to say that there is a VERY small amount of people on this site who even knows what DeviantArt is, let alone enough to know what the issue is with the image sizing.

You would be better served asking this question on the DeviantArt forums.
That's actually happening to me right now. Did you try the help desk? I think they are fixing some things and we might have to wait it out. I already asked them, but will have to wait on their answer.
