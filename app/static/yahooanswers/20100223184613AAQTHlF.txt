Why wont the questions i answer show up on formspring?
i keep getting questions in my inbox on formspring, and i answer them but once i reload the page the questions just show up in my inbox again and arnt on my profile page. help?

i have no idea why this is happening. its happening to me too, and im getting really annoyed with it. someone told me to try making a new formspring but i really dont want to cause it has all of my other questions in it. i was trying to find other stuff about it but i couldnt find anything =\
OMG SAME :| How do we fix thissss. someone helppp.
