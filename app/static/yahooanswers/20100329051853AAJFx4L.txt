Twitter Q: Why have some of my Tweets disappeared from my home page?
I've just signed back into Twitter after a few days and I'm shocked to find all but one of my remarks from last Sunday are missing. There was nothing controversial or any swearing involved. I can only recall one regarding the football which said "Normal service resumed at Old Trafford" when United equalized. Hardly the stuff to excite potential censors!

Does anyone know why or if this is a normal occurrence?

It could be a glitch?
As far as i know, Twitter is suffering from some intern glitch cased by the software environments file.

be patient, they will fix it soon, we know that from yahoo. don't we?
Im having same problem and theres about 600 people on the help section, on twitter under the knwon issues, hope they put our tweets back on the timeline! :( it would suck if we lost them forever.
