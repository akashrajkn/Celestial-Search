Copy the entire profile folder from the old machine to the new one. 

Here's where it's located:

*nix-like operating systems: ~/.mozilla/firefox/

OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/

Windows 2000/Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\

Windows Vista/Windows 7: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\

This will also copy your addons, browsing history and other profile-specific settings.
