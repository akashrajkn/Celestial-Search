What will happen if I don't give the money back?
I sold a phone on ebay and the shipped it out fast, well when the buyer got it he tells me it was in a bad condition and was broke, I sent it out in a perfect condition so wouldn't recept a return, he opened a case and won, I recieved the item back but its clearly been broken after he got it, I already used the money and i refuse to give him the money back

Then you will be sued in the court of law. Unless you have proof that before you ship it it as in perfect condition.
