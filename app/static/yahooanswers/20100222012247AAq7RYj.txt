Is there a way to make Internet Explorer start when I log in?
When I log in can I make Internet Explorer (8) start straight away? Also I have XP.

Thanks

Go to START -> Programs -> Startup
Right click on Startup then click explore.
Now just drag your Internet Explorer shortcut to that folder.

Now Internet Explorer will start every time you log in :)
Yes, simply copy the shortcut for Internet Explorer to Start > All Programms > Startup.
Right-click the Internet Explorer shortcut and select copy, click Start>> programs>> start up menu and paste in there.
Yes, Copy Internet-Explorer to Start --> All Programs --> Start-up.
But it sill slow you computer down
