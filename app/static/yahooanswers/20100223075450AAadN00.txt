How do I get internet?
I realize that this is a really dumb question, but I can't seem to find the answers I need!

* I just got a new laptop.  It has built in bluetooth, wireless and a integrated 56k modem
* I have no landline (only a cell phone - through Verizon)
* I have no cable, not even basic
* I don't want a landline, but wouldn't mind getting cable if it would offer me cheaper internet

What do I need to do to get internet (obviously, wireless internet)?  There is so much information out there about phone lines, cable lines, modems, router, etc.  I just need someone to clarify my easiest option with my current situation.

Also, what carriers should I consider?  Or....do I have to go through my cell phone provider?

Thanks!

Im going to be general here,

There are a lot of internet providers out there that offer wired and wireless internet
If you are going to go wired internet, you have to buy a wireless router to achieve wireless internet

if you go for wireless internet, then there shouldn't be any problem.

I dont know about Verizon, but it internet providers differ from each country so i cant help you with that.
f you go for wireless internet, then there shouldn't be any problem..................
