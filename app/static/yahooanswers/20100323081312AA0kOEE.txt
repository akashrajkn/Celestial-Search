What website can I go to for affordable cigarette cartons?
My family wants to start buying cigarettes online because they're a lot more affordable.
We're looking for Marlboro or Camels?
There was one website that had great deals,but we forgot the name of it.
Could you help us out please?

We're looking for American and European cigarettes.

Depends on whether you want American or European cigs!
I personaly buy cigarettes from the site: http://www.cigarette-store.org/, which produce their stuff in the Eastern Europe. The quality is not worse than in US, believe me. The reason why they are so cheap is that the labour cost is much lower there.
