How much does it allow for a rapidshare premium user to download perday?
and what are the options that I have when my daily downloads are finished?
I heard that rapidshare allow 10gb for their premium user perday.. but recently I have seen that they have limited their downloading quota for 4gb per day.

Thank you

Download utorrent  it is free.
Just download one of the premium downloaders from the site in my source. You can use them with a free account and you don't have to worry about the bandwidth or time restrictions. Plus you can download as many as you want. They work great. When you go to the site, it doesn't really matter which one you get as they all pretty much have the same features and do the same thing for what you need.

Good luck!
