Clear your cache and cookies via the tools tab on your browser.

Internet explorer = Tools > internet options > clear cookies.

Firefox = Tools > clear recent history > select everything.

You can do this regularly by using a tool like Ccleaner, a free clean out tool

You are typing something wrong, did you misspell something or put a _ when it should be a -  for example?  If you forgot your password just click on the link underneath. 

Try clearing your bookmarks and log onto the Ebay page from the start. See if that helps? Other than that you will have to just contact them and ask for a reset of you log in details.
you need to have ebay in your 'safe' list in tools/ internet options/security tab/click on trusted sites then click sites and add ebay to the allowed list
Just click on the forgot my password and it will ask your email address and email you a temp password then log in to activate it and then change your password.
