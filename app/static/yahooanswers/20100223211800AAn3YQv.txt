Is it possible to hack into the stock market and steal all the money?
Im writing a book. I also want to know the steps and types of viruses involved also how many people would some thing like this need?

Yes and of course somebodies going to give it to you because you know EVERYBODY in the public has hacked the stock market and stolen all the money amirite.
no, don't you think it would have been done by now if it was possible.
Yes. It can be done. My friend did it once. He wrote some crazy ass virus with Visual Basic and encoder. He was also working with some hackers from Russia. Last year they hacked into NASDAQ and stole a little over $20 million. Nobody found out. My friend's retired now and he lives on a private island in the Caribbean. We play Halo together sometimes.
YES AND NO BUT TO THE CONTRARY IN REVERSE
ya i did last week
lolwut

i dont think so pal, the stock market doesnt run on a computer...but many

it would take tons of planning and infiltration would need to happen well before the money was stolen. tons of spying for information would need to be done, and eventually after cracking the TLS protocols they use when doing transactions, you inject your own crafted packet that contains the address of your own bank account, but you don't steal all the money, just pennies at a time, so no one notices.

eventually after stealing 1000000000 pennies, you're rich

btw no 'virus' could ever accomplish anything near this alone, it takes a hacker at his keyboard, not a script kiddie on hackforums.com
