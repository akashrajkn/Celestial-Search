If you dont have internet on your phone ... ?
If you dont have internet on your phone and you go to a place with WiFi, would you have internet then?

Only if your phone is WIFI enabled .........
If you're phone is not designed to use internet, you can't use internet anywhere because it doesn't have a wireless adapter built in to pick up the signal.
As long as your phone has a wifi card built into it.
If the phone has the capability to connect to WiFI networks and you have authorisation to use the network, then yes.
