Help on getting links on here?! please help ???
okay so i would like to ask a question about a photo, but obviously id have to link to another page so you people conveyw it... so how in the world do i do this?

go to the page you want to link and copy the web address in your web browser.  then you can paste this link into a question.
right click the page and if the link appears copy it down. or if its on the web, copy down the web address and post it wherever you want to. :)
Just select the link, right click and copy (or press ctrl+c) then right click and paste (or press ctrl+v) it into your question here. Hope that helps. :)
