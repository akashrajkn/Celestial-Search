I need help with Skype?
Okay I need your help. Why is this happening?! My webcam is working fine but for skype its difficult. I can see my face but i cannot see the other persons. Please tell me if you can solve this!! I need help

well they might have a problem with their webcam
If there is no problem with your web cam...then it is most likely the other persons. Did they answer the call "with video?" If they can see you, then it is their camera with the problems.
