google chrome, internet explorer, or firefox?
so which web browser do you use? and why not the others?

firefox cus it blocks viruses and some pop ups
internet explorer is rubbish
chrome annoys me
Firefox forever :)
I personally use firefox. I love the ability to use all the customizable addons and everything. 

I don't use internet explorer, because its to simplistic in its look and feel, its not customizable for shit, and i just don't like to support microsoft more than i already do.

As for chrome, i can't say ive used it a whole lot, but its security is good, and has decent add-ons and everything, but it seems to have the simplicity related to IE. 

Overall i like firefox layout customization, protection add-ons, and over look and layout!
Firefox is most safe... it checks everything on viruses and trojans and it doesn't freeze all the time like explorer does.
I agree with the first answer. I use firefox.
reasons:
¡èie is horrible, terribly slow, its full of holes and I don't like endorsing ms anymore than I have to.
¡è chrome is meant to be fast but for me it is slower than Firefox. I also don't like the theme it has, it looks boring and not like a traditional browser. That is why back in the day so many people went to Firefox - because it had a similar feel to ie.
¡èopera is great on mobiles but takes over my pc on the windows application and is slightly annoying.
¡ènever tried safari.
¡èkonquorer was alright, but I don't use Linux anymore so I don't use it.
¡èi've also made my own browser but its pretty crappy at the moment so I use Firefox.
