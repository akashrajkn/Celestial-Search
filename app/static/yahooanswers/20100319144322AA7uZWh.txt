For Windows (this says XP but is the same for Vista and 7)::

Vista and 7 also have a snipping you can use for screen shots:

The PrtScrn button does work, but it only copies the image to memory. You have to use a paint program to *paste* the image so you can save and share it. (Make sure you censor any info you don't want the entire Internet to see!)

Holding down Alt makes PrtScrn copy only the active window, and not the entire desktop.
I do a lot of screencasts for my educational video podcast, and the one I've found to be great and easy to use is Total Screen Recorder. The screen recording is rendered as .AVI / WMV / SWF / FLV.
