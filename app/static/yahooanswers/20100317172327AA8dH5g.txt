I can't delete Cyberlink Youcam. How?!? IS IT A VIRUS?
I installed the 30 day free trial, but now it's over and I figured it would uninstall itself once the trial ended, but it didn't. Now when I try and use Skype or make videos I cant because I need Cyberlink. Basically, it's in the way! Please help me! Is it a virus?. Best Answer that works gets 10 pts.
