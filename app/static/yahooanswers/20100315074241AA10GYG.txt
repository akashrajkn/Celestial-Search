Keeping buyer feedback private on ebay?
Is there anyway of keeping the item description that youve bought private - not the comment theyve left but the actual item title? Thanks

no the description it there for every one ! but no
one can see that you are the one
that bought it !
Possibly no option for this.  I changed my mind about bidding on Saturday because I found that whereas the seller had reasonable feedback generally, his feedback on previous sales of the particular item I wanted to bid on (a cell phone) was poor.  Complaints about his conduct when selling cell phones.
Therefore if I found a seller had hidden the item description part of their feedback, I would simply move on to another seller
then speak to ebay

they own the website dont they!
The seller can set this up!  There is a option to have 'private" listings where bidders identitys are hidden from everyone except the seller & ebay of course. When they leave you feedback, it'll just have their comment, their user name & have the word private written there -  noone will be able to view what you purchased or the Item title.  Its really good if you have purchased something like a birthday pressie or something thats a bit embarrassing :)  Only the seller can set this up though not the buyer.
OR you have the option of making all your feedback private, noone will be able to see your feedback except you. If you are selling though you are not able to use this option. See the site map under feedback for info on how to do this.
you can ask the seller not to leave you feedback
