importing firefox bookmarks..help?
had to reformat, so what i did was went into my firefox folder, and uploaded my bookmark.html file from my firefox folder onto a hosting site, and now i reformatted, and im trying to get my bookmarks on my firefox again..

im going to bookmarks > organize bookmarks > import and backup > import >import html file, and i look for the file, and click ok..but then nothing happens

help?

may be the html file has no data. Open html file in an viewer or in editor (MS Word), and see if the data are available.

Now save as the html file and try again.
Good luck.
Download the html file, save to desktop.
In Firefox, go to bookmarks > organize bookmarks > import and backup > import >import html file> next> browse to the desktop> select the downloaded file> follow prompts.
give up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer without opening any windows something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible. firefox no longer uses html for bookmarks it uses sqlite databases which has confused and upset everybody and what used to be a simple job is now a nightmare, by the way 99% of the time reformats and re-installs are not necessary
