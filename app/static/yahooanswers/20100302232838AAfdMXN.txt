What is the best internet?
I live in Oregon and I currently have Qwest but it absolutely sucks. Every time I am in a match (xbox live) I constantly get disconnected and it is extremly annoying.

I think Road Runner is the best internet.
The best internet varies by location. Do some snooping around. Around here it's Verizon FIOS.
As said before, check out the ISP reviews in your area.

DSLreports.com is great for this.
I think even speedtest.net can be useful as well.

based on my own extensive experience though, avoid wireless (radio), satelite, and DSL based internet providers. They are slow and or very finicky.
