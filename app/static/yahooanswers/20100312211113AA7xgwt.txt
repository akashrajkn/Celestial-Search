Why is Centurylink services so expensive?
ok, ive only been with them 1 month, all i have with them is phone service and 0.77 mbps internet which is slowest high speed and my first months bill is $155 0_o i dont even have cable channels with that either
what would they charge me if i upgraded to there 10mb speed 200!!!!! and they advertise as low as $29.99 yeah right
they say additional fees and charges may apply, but they dont tell you its quadruple times there advertised price!!!!

They are just trying to cheat you.Instead of going to court just change your service.
