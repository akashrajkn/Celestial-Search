Is formspring going to reveal?
What should I do I they do?  I wrote something on someone's to get revenge.  If they reveal I am fucked.  


What I'd the true story to this?

I read an article on the internet saying that it's all a joke, they aren't really going to be revealing anything. But at the end of the day you shouldn't be hiding behind anonymity... that's just stupid of you.
