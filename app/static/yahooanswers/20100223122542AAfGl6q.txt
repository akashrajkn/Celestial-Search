Do you know chatroulette?
I got to know it, and found it very boring. Most "chats" would last only less than half a second. Maybe it?s nice if you are a young girl wanting to show the t.i..t.s...For me it was a terrible and boring experience...What is your opinion?

I'm too scared to try it but I told my roommate about it and most of the people on there were pervy males or people... err... touching themselves. But I think it has the potential to be a really cool website for meeting people if everyone on there weren't so creepy.
