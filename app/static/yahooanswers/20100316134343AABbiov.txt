Is there anybody who has a Sagem (sky) router UK?
Well, I have one, and I'd like to know if it is possible to restrict a certain devices use of the internet. Like put a time limit on it's mac address, so that this person can't go on the internet past a certain time. I know you can put time limits on websites, and you can completely block devices, but this person still needs access. Do you get me? Anyone know if it is possible on one of these? Thanks. x

i got one and naa its not possible unless you buy an attatchment but its not 100% guaranteed on this skky router because of the way they make it
