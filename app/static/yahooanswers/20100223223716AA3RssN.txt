Is the text to this article on this link missing for anyone else also?
There's an article here on Yahoo and it says nothing, the text area looks blank where the text should be ? 
http://finance.yahoo.com/retirement/article/108881/what-you-need-to-know-about-social-security?mod=retire-planning

Is blank the way it looks on your monitor also, for the people who can display it, what does it say, perhaps copy and paste the text or something  ?

Yes it is blank for me too ( both in firefox and IE).
