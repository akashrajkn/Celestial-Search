question about a scenario on ebay!?!!?!?
so i have two ebay accounts and was wondering what happens if i do this?..........

on one of my ebay account i put up a listing of an item. Than on the other ebay account I buy it and than leave feedback while the other account does the same thing leaving feedback...therefore I will have feedback for both accounts...

will ebay find out about this??

Yes eBay will find out they always do and you will more then likely be banned for it cause it is against the rules.
Thats an expensive & foolish way of building up your feedback.  High probability of ebay finding out & cancelling/restricting your accounts.(& for what? one measly feedback!)
