How much should I offer for a domain name that I want?
A web domain that I want is currently for sale, but the seller asks for an offer.  What is an appropriate offer to make for a domain name?  I don't even know where I would start.

$100?  $1000?

It is for a business.

You just first asks the Customer what is the Price Expectation ratio ...Then only you know that where they..If you provide the offer that is below to customer expectation means you are loser..So you need to analyze the customer mind..Also i here want to say a thing to you..You sell Domain name or website at low cost,because Today many site selling the Domain and hosting plans at low cost also Free Hosting also..In the site http://www.tucktail.com/ they providing the Domain name at low cost and also free hosting,offers,many free services...
