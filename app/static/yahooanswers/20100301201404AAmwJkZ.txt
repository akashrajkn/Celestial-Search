Email that allows you to attach big size files?
The file I need to send is 181MB.
What email can i use to send it? For school thank you

You will need to upload that to a file sharing site like Drop.io. Even if you could attach that large of a file, the person you're sending it to may not be able to receive an attachment that large.
The only one I know of is gmail
