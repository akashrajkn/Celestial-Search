how will amazon send me my prepaid phone card?
by email or mail? if its by mail is there any way i can make them send the code through email?

They will most likely send it to you through mail,

I know that email is much more convenient, but amazon only likes to send receipts and "requests for feedback" emails, I have never heard of anyone receiving pre paid codes through email from amazon, only coupon codes and such.
It depends on what your prepaid phone card is. You can receive Virtual Calling Card by Email INSTANTLY.
