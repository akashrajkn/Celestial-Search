Can someone tell me why I am having trouble accessing a certain section of this websight?
Ok they updated their websight and now I am having trouble with the patient login section.  There is no SUBMIT button and it does not allow you to read all the text in that section.  I am even having trouble submitting a complaint about the websight on that websight.  So if you go there click on patient login on upper left corner and tell me what you see, does it require a special application or version of an application that I don't have intstalled?  Does it require having high speed access?  http://www.haltomorthodontics.com/

Try going to the website,, not the websight,, that is your problem.. ~

Edit :  You are just trying to get views on a site.. you have no issues , except you can not spell
