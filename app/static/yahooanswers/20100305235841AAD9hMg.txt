Does anyone know about or have you ever gotten a "free" IPhone on the net?
I know this is the number one internet no no, but there are all these sites saying, "no scam no credit card just fill out these forums." I mean Im so down to fill out an hours worth of sucky forums for a free super ipod, so if you have ever had an experience with these things(good or bad) or know someone who has then please give me the low down on these sketchy little deals.

Don't waste your time on those site instead, Just join lockerz, It has 1 simple question a day answer it get points for it and redeem those points for you favorite electronic item including ipods,psp and much more.There are many more simple ways to earn points.
No credit cards, No referals, No surveys and absolutely no advertisements..

All you need is an lockerz invite,which I would be more than happy to invite you, you can get your ipod touch 32gb in less than a month, I got ma ipod touch 32gb last month, Although 64gb touch is placed at much higher points getting a 32gb touch is no problem at all..
Just send me a invite request to ma id vinod9987@gmail.com. With "invite me" in subject.

By the way did I mention all this is for free, sounds too good to be true? lockerz manages all this bcoz only a person with lockerz invite can join..

You can do your little research if you want to..
As a testament to the legitimacy of Lockerz.com, its CEO, Kathy Savitt, used to be Vice President at Amazon.com and the CMO at American Eagle. Lockerz.com major financial contributors is Liberty Media, which owns a major part of Time Warner, which is the firm that supports Bodybuilding.com and QVC

You better hurry up! cuz I'l stop sending invitation after a while..
