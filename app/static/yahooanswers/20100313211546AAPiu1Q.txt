Firefox - How do I block all sites by default, and set up a whitelist?
I'm trying to set up Firefox so that by default it blocks all websites, except for certain sites on a "whitelist," so my kid can go on the internet, but only use the sites that are on the list.
How would I go about doing this?

Download the add on for Firefox, forget what its called.  Then you can do that, but it will be a pain.  You'd be better off using something like K9.
This article explains it.
