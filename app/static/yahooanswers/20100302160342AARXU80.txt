Are "sex and horror the new gods"?
Frankie say "no more".  Frankie say, what do you think?  Listen to _Welcome to the Pleasuredome_ and then answer.  You'll be no more enlightened than the next person, but the Internet discloses what we don't normally see and the fussbudgets of the world can't seem to Stop It when it comes to drawing a weapon or stoning women for adultery.  So sit back, Relax, and think of what Two Tribes will be next.  No predictions, no mistakes.  You gotta take risks in life.  Sometimes, you look stupid.  But the Truth will set you free--even if you don't subscribe to Rush Limbaugh or Silly Stewart.  Tell you what, just go watch SNL (or CNN), Frankie was before his time.
