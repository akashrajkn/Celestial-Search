What can I do to improve my blog and promote it?
I have a new blog (Desktop Organizers) at desktoporganizers.blogspot.com. I'm posting a bunch of original designs for wallpaper that people can use for free. The wallpapers have different spaces on it to help organize. It's fairly new, so I'm finding that it's hard to get the word out about it.

Could you check out my blog and give me suggestions on how to improve it and how to advertise it? 

Thanks!!! :D

You stand little chance of being taken seriously when using blogspot.com - it's OK to some extent but when it comes to marketting your site, no other webmaster will even contemplate linking with you or reviewing your site.   We get hundreds of submissions to our site each month from "developers" with freeware programs from blogspot.com which we now reject automatically because they almost always abandon their site and software.   If your serious about your site, get a decent host (i.e. MDD Hosting) - their packages start from $6 per month and I can vouch for them, install a free forum like SMF and then you'll stand a chance!.
Hope that helps :)
I looked at your blog and liked it except it's kind of hard to read the writing. The letters aren't bright enough against the black background.
