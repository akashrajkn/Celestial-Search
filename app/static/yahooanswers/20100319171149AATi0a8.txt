How to add bookmark to more than one Firefox folder..?
I am running Firefox 3.6 and there is a particular website I would like to bookmark in two of my bookmark folders.

I can place the website into the first folder no problems, however when I go to add it to the second folder it only lets me keep it in the folder I put it in originally, or to remove it from that folder and put it into the new folder.

So I guess I am wondering whether you can have the same website bookmarked in two or more folders at the same time?

Thanks.

Google Chrome is better and even faster than firefox....But try this:
