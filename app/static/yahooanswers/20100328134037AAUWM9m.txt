Setting up Homepages?
I want to set up multiple pages on my firefox browser when I first open up the internet.  I want them all to be in different tabs.  Is there any way I can do this?

Go into firefox and go to the place to change the homepage.  There, type multiple sites separated by the pipe (|) character.  For example if you set the homepage to

http://nyt.com/|http://google.com

then it will open both in different tabs.
Open up all the tabs with the websites you want saved as your home pages. Go to Firefox in the menu bar, click on preferences, under "general" there is a box for your home page. You can click on the button that says "Use Current Pages" and it will automatically enter the pages for you.
