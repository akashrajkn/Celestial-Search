Do you backspace through complete words when you make a mistake typeing?
Do you usually see your mistake and then backspace (aka destroy) the whole word and re-type it. Or do you use the arrow key to go directly to the misspelled letter(s)?

 I find it faster to just start over myself.

Only when i'm frustraited, which, when you screw up a word, you can get prettly frustraited, especially when you do it over and over and over again!
