Which is the best Internet Service Provider?
I am currently with AOL and i'm pretty disappointed with it so i want to change providers. I've read conflicting views about Virgin media. Some say it's good while others think it's very slow.

BT..but it is not the cheapest
I prefer cable from Roadrunner.
bt, there the best
I am very satisfied with Yahoo! on Sky.
You would only be able to get the fibre optic cable service if your road is cabled.

If not then you will only be able to get their ADSL service which will be no better or worse than any other because you are still using the same phone lines and exchanges.

The only difference between them is the different packages and the general service.

If you are able to get cable then it delivers what it says on the tin. I'm on the 20 Mb/s service.

Zen or O2. Do not go with BT - very expensive and you could go mad trying to understand the people from their Technical helpline which is based abroad.
