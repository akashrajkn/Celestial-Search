Help with Blog Name!?
Hi, just want some advice on a col blog name. The blog would just simply talk about random things (photography, music, school, life, love, etc.) 

I'm looking in the direction of samples like : whatthejunk
But that's already taken.

Wants to depict a little joke or comedic side on the blog name. Thanks!

Go to Digg and see what headlines get the most diggs. Use those for your inspiration...
