What do you do when a buyer doesn't leave feedback on eBay and won't respond?
Help, as I am getting frustrated!

Feedback is NOT compulsory!  One of these days, when a seller keeps hassling me to leave feedback I shall put negative and the words ..... this is the feedback you MADE me leave.

Leave them alone.
Surely it's their prerogative to just buy and leave. That's what happens in High Street shops or the classified ads in newspapers.
Be patient. I once sold 27 items to one person in one go, and they didn't leave feedback for 3 months. They had been on holiday lol

They may not have access to the internet for a while, or just forgot. Give it time, it's not the end of the world.
Why are you getting frustrated, far too many people worry about feedback. Do you go into a shop and ask them to rate your transaction ?
Feedback is only relevant in ebay world, not the real one.
You can not force anyone to leave you feedback. Contacting them all the time to do so would probably result in feedback that you do not want. I would leave it alone.
Ebay feedback is a system designed to help others understand the trustworthyness of buyers/sellers. Feedback is a courtesy to others. Most people provide feedback. But it's not mandatory. If your buyer doesn't post feedback, forget about it and move on.
Don't give feedback to buyers until you recieve feedback first from them. Thats what I do.
