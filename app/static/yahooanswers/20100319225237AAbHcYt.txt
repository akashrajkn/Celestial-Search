firefox vs internet explorer?
hey 
i like using firefox better , coz its faster , lighter and less crappy , although i have one very useful advantage when using internet explorer , that is when using youtube .
when the video streams completely , i just click download (using realplayer) and it downloads instantly , while its not the case with firefox , it downloads but not instantly.
wanted to know if i have my firefox settings wrong , or something with cookies and stuff i dont know about
thanks :)

you cant really get internet explorer completely out your system because your pc needs some internet exp to make some its programs run correct
i use firefox also,which i never have issues with but for certain things,the pc has a mind of itsown and at times uses intenet exp,like i said there some parts of the pc that really need int explorer to work right
i wouldnt worry  your str8
No dude... Those things are related to features of a browser... So that's that... Ok.. Happy surfing
