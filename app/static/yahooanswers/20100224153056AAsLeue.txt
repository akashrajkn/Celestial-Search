Google is your friend. Common sense is your anti-virus.
There are several ways to get free music online, without viruses.

Rapidshare, megaupload, torrents, etc.
Feel free to message me if you want any help beyond this, such as which sites/programs to avoid, etc.
I'm always more than happy to help (:


Oh, and, it should be fun to see how many people answer by telling you that sharing music without paying for it is highly illegal, blah blah. Despite all the obvious websites out there that are still handing it out, illegal downloading is CLEARLY the number one concern right now. ?_?
I don't think you can get a virus from mp3's anymore. Any exploit that once existed years ago had to do with the player, which by now would have been patched. But if you want something for free (illegal), then there's no way to expect zero problems with it. You tend to get what you pay for.
I use this great music, video download tool.
It help me download music video from most video sharing webs.
Then you can convert video to audio format(mp3)
