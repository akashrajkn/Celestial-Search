Will I get credit for creating it and uploading it?
I made a few psp themes and I know people can upload them on psp-themes.net  but will we be credited for it?  Such as like who created it  and stuff?  I don't want someone else claiming my work.  Oh and if you know somewhere else where I can upload my psp themes and get credited for it then let me know. Thanks.

You could always put a watermark on your design.
