Skype: Can you make your status invisible to specific people without blocking them?
I am friends with a guy who likes talking a little too much on Skype. I decided I would try and block him, but when I went to it said he would be removed from my contact list. If I do this will he know I have removed him?

The reason I ask is because I don't want to offend him, he is a nice guy but a bit too chatty on Skype. I can't set my status to invisible as I want my other friends to know I am online. What can I do?

No, unfortunetly you can't.
Just block them temporarily.
If you remove him from your contact list he will not know you did that, and will not be able to see whether you are online.
