where can i make online calls from pc for free?
Without having to download anything and without all the run around.

I think the only way is Skype...Or you can ask someone in the chat room to call for you.
Of course you would have to download something! Websites can't acess your computer like that.

try www.evaphone.com, you just dial, watch a short ad, and your connected.
iCall for web is the only one I can think of.
