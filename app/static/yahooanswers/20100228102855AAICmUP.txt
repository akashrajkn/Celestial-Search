How can I get more people to follow me on Twitter ?
My Twitter is Twitter.com/laurabbygurl if you have one will you please follow me?

add random people
hahahahah jsut add random people follow me :P!
People dont just follow random people... They follow people of interest, whether it be family, friends, or some for of entertainment star. Twitter is a social site, so your not just going to get followers like that, first you need to make sure your not putting lame posts on there. Second, people need a reason to like you. 

For example, i have no clue who you are... i dont like you because you fail at the way of the interwebs, third, No, i will not follow you...
Participate in Follow Fridays. Promote it on twitter forums (example: http://tweetforums.com) and just tell your friends. Follow others they may follow you back.
