Is it possible to text a mobile phone for free from the internet?
I'm on T-Mobile and it would be to another UK phone

Usually if you go to your service providers website you can text from there. I guess it just depends...
Hope this helps!(:
there are a few iPod/i Phone apps for it   txtPlus for example
Skype charges near to nothing.

Cbfsms Best one!
yea i do it with yahoo messenger all the time
Not really...not if the recipient has to pay for their incoming text messages as well as their outgoing text messages (which is usually the case).

If the person you wish to text has a prepaid messaging package (GBP 5 for 500 text messages, for example) then unless s/he goes over the allowance, then no, it won't cost any extra.
If you have yahoo messenger you can text free from there and get texts back. Kinve like im. But they would get txt on cell and when they text back you get message on computer. I do it all the time and it doesn't cost the other person anything except for standard text messaging rates which they have to agree to before they can text you back or receive your texts.
Yes.

Certainly o2 offer such a service... dunno about T Mobile though.
