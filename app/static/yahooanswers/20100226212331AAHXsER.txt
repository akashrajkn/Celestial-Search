Does this website look legit to you?
I recently got a traffic ticket in Florida(Where I live) so I wanted to do a Driver's improvement course, to prevent the points from being taken away from my License and the insurance going up. However, I became a little skeptical, when during the sign up phase, the website wanted my Card's zip number, not CVN. Is there a reason for this?

This is the website, http://www.lowestpricetrafficschool.com/
The website does ask for the CVN as well and not just the card's zip, but just both.

just ran it through norton security site. it says site is safe, run it through google and see what you can find out about it.
all websites want different things

if you dont want to use it then dont

its all up to you - no one else
