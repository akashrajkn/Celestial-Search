I have no trouble when I am browsing internet. All the non-video sites runs fast, so i know that it is not the internet problem. But when I go the any site that has videos in it, I cannot see videos easily. All the videos are choopy. The audio works great when seeing video, but the video is choppy. It is not only to a one website like youtube, but I have tried other video websites too and still cannot watch videos properly. I tried to let it download first like in youtube(the redline goes all the way), and then I play but still no results. It is not the internet problem. I have high speed internet. When I go to non-video sites, all run like a high speed train. My laptop is 6 years old.
Any help is appreciated.
Thank You.

your computer may need to be updated, this is only a guess

eather that or you might need a new video card

im just wondering how long this is going on because you might need a new computer or your computer might have a virus on it
