Firefox 3.5 browsing history problem?
I have tried deleting my browsing history on Firefox,yet when i go to type a website in the bar, websites that I have not been on appear. I have not been on 'dirty' websites, I just don't want others to see what websites I use etc when they borrow my laptop.

You are probably only clearing the past hour. Goto tools > clear recent history. Ensure that EVERYTHING is selected in the top drop down box.
Go to Options ---> Privacy  --->  Location bar and set it to Nothing.
To clear cache, cookies, history, and other rubbish your computer stores download and use ccleaner.

its free here

Be warned it will also remove any saved passwords you use for websites.
