Keepvid.com isn't working?
I've been using Keepvid.com for years to download videos from YouTube. For some reason, when I pasted the link into the "download" bar, it comes up with a bunch of percentage signs and said, "Firefox cannot download this file." Is anyone else having this problem? And if so, how can this be fixed?

Hi Rascal. Keepvid doesn't work with the latest YouTube changes. You could try VDownloader instead.
ClipNabber is a similar site which still works for downloading youtube videos.
