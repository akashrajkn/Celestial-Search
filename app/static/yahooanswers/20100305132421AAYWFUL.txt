Firefox v.s. Chrome???????
I am in between please help me make up my mind..

firefox has become glitchy ...chrome is way too much of a power hog I suggest useing flock ...flock has all the benafits of firefox plus twice the speed without the glitching
Firefox is alot faster and has alot more features. Google seems to try to make more of a clean interface before reliable features. Firefox 4 still has not come out yet so wait a little bit i guess.

also the chrome ad blocker doesn't block all of the ads the one for firefox blocks ALL OF THEM. 

Hope this helps.
Chrome... I'm pretty sure that it's the fastest browser ever.
However, it has gotten really buggy on all of my computers at one point in time. Good thing is that it un-installs and re-installs rather quickly and it's always fixed the bug problems so far.
firefox
if you want a lot of extensions use firefox
if you want speed use chrome
FireFox is the slower
Google Chrome is the fastest 
so take my advice and pick Chrome
