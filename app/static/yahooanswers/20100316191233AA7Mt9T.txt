Is MovShare legal? 10 Easy Points?
I was wondering is illegal to watch movies streaming on your computer off sites like MovShare. If so what are the chances of getting caught and what are the repercussions?

Im pretty sure ANY streaming of real full movies is bootlegging/piracy.The chances of you geting caught aren't THAT high,considering tons of people do it,but bootlegging/piracy is higly illegal and you could end up in jail.
Heres a list of sites approved sites.
