anyone know any good chat rooms other than yahoo?

Preferably Free!

chatroulette.com
Go on Imvu.com its a great website for many people and you can chat everything you wan't its also educational.
There are so many chat rooms, you should give some more details what you like and what you prefer, anyway, I like to use the chat of Frenzoo, it's an virtual world, where you can chat but also join contest and create items for your 3-d avatar. They are hosting this Sunday (March 28) a chat event where everyone is matched to another gender, i joined the last one and had pretty fun. It's free you just need to run a plug in to start, other good chat places are Secondlife or Meez. Try them.
