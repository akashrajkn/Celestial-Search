Should a 13year old have a blog?


Should a dog have legs?

No one cares who has a blog unless they're famous and have a bunch of obsessive and lifeless followers.
Does a 13 yr old have anything worthwhile to say?
No
Hope that helps!
No.  No one cares about blogs.  If anything, a 13 year old should have a journal.
