Windows 7 internet connection problem?
I installed window 7 recently (64 bit). The install went fine. No problems. My problem is with the internet. For some reason it just stops working. I am using a WUSB600N Linksys USB wireless adapter. I will be using the computer (or sometimes I will walk away and leave it on) and my internet will stop working. I get a yellow exclamation point on the wireless thing in the tool bar. 
I check device manager and everything is fine. The real problem is once this happens the Wireless usb does not respond at all. If I go unplug it from my computer and plug it back in not even the indicator light will turn on. The PC also doesn't make the eject sound either. It completely refuses to recognize it. Then if I hit shut down or restart. my computer will stay on the shut down screen and not properly shut down. This only occurs if the internet "goes out" otherwise my computer shuts down just fine. 
The internet also "goes out" in safe mode. While the internet is functioning the computer operates perfectly. I have tried the ipconfg/ renew and everything but it comes back clean unless I do it when the internet "goes out", than I get an error. I have also tried the RAlink driver and that doesn't stop it either.

well check if you have installed the drivers for the device or/and check if there are compatible drivers with your win7 64bit version, anyway Always check before installing another os, especially if it's a 64bit, if it's completely compatible.

You have to call or chat with Microsoft. They "optimized" my internet explorer (even though I don't use it) and for some reason it fixed my connection problem.
