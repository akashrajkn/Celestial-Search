Is there a way to get free shipping on ebay?
I am looking to get some things on ebay but the shipping is like 50 bucks plus for some items. Is there anyway to bypass the shipping and make it free? I heard there is a website that you can go to that can search or do this for you. Is there a way?

You can go and get them yourself.
The only way I know is if the seller offers Free shipping .
Amazon.com is better and sometimes you can get free shipping if you spend like 25 dollars or more
The only way you get free shipping is look in the category: Shipping Costs. $_______  If it says free then you get it free.  There is no one going to pick up the tab for shipping except you. Sorry.
Yes - there are a couple of ways 

1.  You can ask the seller to pay for the shipping for you - they will probably say no!  But try!

2.  Ask the seller to add the shipping cost into the price of what you are buying and charge you $0.00 for shipping!
