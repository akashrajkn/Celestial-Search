Is anyone else having problems with their Firefox browser ;-( I can't navigate today?
i re-installed and i'm still having the same problem...
i can open the browser, but can go no further, i get the "not responding" message...
good grief, it just started responding again...
 
computers,,, irritating as hell,,, even when they are brand new!

"Can't navigate" is pretty vague.  What do you do and what happens when you do it?

Sorry.
