How to add a Chatroulette style webcam chat to a website?
I want to kind of recreate a Chatroulette site but I don't know how to use peer to peer webcam connections. Any help?

You can use a free service like OMG Chat to embed a free chat room on your website, otherwise you will have to get a flash hosting server and write your own application.

You can create a room instantly by adding your room-name after "http://www.omgchat.com/room/"

Example: http://www.OMGchat.com/room/Yahoo
