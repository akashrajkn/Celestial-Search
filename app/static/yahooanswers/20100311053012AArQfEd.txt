does anyone use www.getsometunes.co.uk?
I used to download some music off here from time to time but now it doesnt seem to be working anymore. 
Anyone ever use this? or know why the site no longer works? xx

I do sometimes
Hi,

Does not seem to work any more, have tried to connect with the site today (Thursday 11th. March ), but no luck, have tried 6 times, so I presume the site has finished or having problems.....hope this helps.........
It seems it's not working anymore. With http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ you search many music sites (for whole albums, add the word "rapidshare").

Hope this helps. Regards!
