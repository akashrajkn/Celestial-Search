I was getting info for something and i notice something was misspelled.... can i trust this site?
They spelled color as "colour". Should i trust this site?

If I didn't trust every site that had a misspelling on it, I would have to stop using the internet... after all it is people that build and maintain websites.

As to whether you can trust the site, look for a physical address, phone number, and privacy policy.
If still in doubt, go somewhere else...
"They spelled color as "colour". "
That isn't necessarily wrong, colour is the normal spelling in British English.

"Should i trust this site?"
Without more information I couldn't say. The odd misspelling wouldn't worry me hugely though. For a commercial site I consider it a huge red flag if I can't find address and telephone information readily but for a personal site this is normal.
