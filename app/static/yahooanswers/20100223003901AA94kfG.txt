I need to think of a user name have any ideas?
My name is Sofie, if it helps my nickname is Yoshi from Super Mario, my favorite color is blue and from my picture you can tell I love coffee lol have any good ideas?
tom i realize you have the good intentions but how in hell is my computer going to get hacked by telling someone my nickname, favorite color, and the fact that i love coffee?
it's not like i wrote my address, phone number, or even my full name.

"so" coffee into "co" and "f" from coffee and your name and Yoshi gives you the "i"

Im not being rude just wondering why you would broadcast for any people on here looking to hack your system..
Try wiki(smile)it has lots of infor Ask Yahoo isn't place you should be asking this with all new virus coming out 24/7..Be safe on this one head to wiki or better yet use your creative thinking and get offline for bit and call a friend or sit and think whats a good name for youself you can do it have faith in you..No slam; only trying to help you keep your computer for alot longer unless your here to find friends then I get it(smile)Ask Yahoo is not like it use to be in alot of ways..Better be safe then sorry..Take care..
try sofi and your birth year like if your birth year is 1980(just and exemple) give sofie80. i have one id like that.
