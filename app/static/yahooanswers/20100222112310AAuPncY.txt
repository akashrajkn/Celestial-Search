no internet pages loading?
my friend has a hp laptop connected to an aol wireless router and she can get on windows live messenger, but cant view web pages in any browsers. any suggestions?

If she can get on live messenger she has a working IP connection. 

Drop to dos and ping Yahoo.com.   If it says it can't resolve the address you have a DNS issue.  Make sure that your wireless adapter is set to accept DNS from the router.

If DNS is ok and the web site answers then you have a browser issue.   Go to your explorer settings and make sure you are not set to use a proxy that doesn't exist.
