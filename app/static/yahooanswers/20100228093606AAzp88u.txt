What is a better browser to use? Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer?
I want a fast reliable browser.

Mozilla
Mozilla's lot better .
i like internet explorer better because my computer is already fast, but i have heard that mozilla firefox is faster.
I like Apple's Safari browser, its free and way faster than the others and it works great on windows.
Have you tried google chrome?  I hear its REALLY fast!
Definately Fire Fox!!!
firefox. because of all the addons IE doesn't have
Mozilla Firefox,-
