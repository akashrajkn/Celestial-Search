what is animal planet's email address ?
i had a complaint about one of their shows but i cant seem to find the contact us tab !
the show was dogs 101

at the very bottom there is a section labeled "viewer relation", click it and you will come to a page were you can click a link and send them a comment, the link will say "click here" and the word "here" is in orange, it's in the first paragraph and I included a link.

I was unable to locate an email address for the website/tv channel itself, but maybe if you include the information on the particular show, we could find something there.

Edit: The answer above is correct. However, you can also find the information here:

Scroll to the bottom of the page. Click "here" in line labeled 33
go to this link http://animal.discovery.com/utilities/about/contact.html
