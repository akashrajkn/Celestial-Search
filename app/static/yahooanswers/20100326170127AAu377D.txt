Why does the wrong website come up?
I type what web site I want in my browser and when the results come up I then clink on the link and a different web site comes up. I then have to click the back button and click the link again and then it will take me where I wanted to go in the first place. This is happening a lot now. Why?

Dear Friend,

Your system may have infected by a Malware, so the problem persits. You may try the following steps:

1. Disconnect to the internet.

2. Open Microsoft Internet Explorer.

3. Click Tools -> Manage Add-Ons.

4. In the "Show" drop-down box, select "All Add-Ons".

5. Disable all the suspicious add-ons, mostly those who does not have any Publisher Name.

6. Restart Microsoft Internet Explorer and connect to the internet.
