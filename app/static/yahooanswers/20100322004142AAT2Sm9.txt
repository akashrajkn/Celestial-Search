which is the best and most reliable web hosting companies in Singapore?
I want to set up a website and sourcing for web hosting provider.  Besides the overseas web hosting, I would like to look for something local with at least 5GB storage space, good bandwidth transfer and customer support.  Please advise.  Thank you.

There are numerous options available - I recommend doing some research at http://www.hosting-picks.com/
Hostmonster provides unlimited domains, unlimited bandwidth. And most of their features are user friendly. Server uptime is above 98%.
Take into consideration that web hosting is a global service. It does not matter what country you are located in; US, UK, Canada, Australia or Singapore. It is good to note that the cost of hosting services in most countries is generally a little more expensive in comparison to the same services in Canada and the United States. Specifically, American web hosts offer a much better value for money than any local hosting.

Take into consideration that some hosting companies are cheating and lying to their customers. It is very important that your service be uptime (functioning and available for use) . It means you can access your account whenever you want to update your web pages, and users can enter your website whenever they refer to your site address. If your hosting service is not uptime it can be catastrophic!

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

Hi,
Don't go for free web hosting.They are not reliable....

It doesn't matter whether the hosting is in Singapore or oversea.As long as it is reliable.

I would recommend "Web Hosting Pad" for your Web Hosting because it's cheap and very reliable.With their web hosting package, you'll get free domain. Their support service is awesome. This company offers site building tools, application vault, web mail, antivirus, Php, MysQL ,e-commerce and hosts unlimited websites in one plan.Check out personal reviews direct from the users here :

Hey Fang, go with either HostGator or Dreamhost. Both meet the criteria you specified in your post and have great support and reliability. I have sites hosted with each of them and they have exceeded my expectations. If you use a coupon you can usually get a good deal. I'm not sure if it is still valid, but the one I used when I signed up with dreamhost is 65OFFHOSTING which will knock $65 off of their yearly hosting plan. Hostgator also has some good coupons out as well right now. Whats great with both of them too, is that they have a money back guarantee, so worst case if you dont like them, you can always cancel and you arent out anything. As for you being overseas, they have 24/7 tech support, so it doesnt matter what time zone you are in, you will still get excellent support. Here's the site I got my coupons from in case you decide to sign up: http://internethostreviews.com/current-h¡­

Good luck in your decision!
the best and most reliable web hosting companies aren't to be found in Singapore, period.
I own 25 Domains and having 13 websites up on my single hosting package and almost 10 websites are database driven and i am getting almost 10,000 to 12,000 visitors daily, i tried lot of web hosting companies including BlueHost, godaddy, DomainBank, Lunarpages, iPower but i was not satosfied with their services, then after few months i discovered http://www.globat.com/join/index.bml?Aff¡­ Globat and i got Unlimited hosting package @ only US$ 4.45 per month now almost 10 months every thing is going smoothly.

Another host which i had good experiences for my company websites is HostGator this is more popular and having almost 800,000 websites hosted on their Web Server. I would suggest you on behalf of my personal experiences that buy hosting from these two hosts, last week i was searching Hosting companies, then i found Crossmedia www.crossmediaglobal.com, this company offering you US$ 25.00 cash return once you buy any hosting package from this website.

I purchased three hosting packages from Crossmedia and after 7 days of purchase they sent me US$ 75.00 for three hosting packages.
