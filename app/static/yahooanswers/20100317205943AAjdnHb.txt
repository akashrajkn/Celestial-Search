Is cellitused.com a legitimate site?
I want to make some money, and I keep seeing things about www.cellitused.com, where you can sell old cell phones and iPods.  Has anyone worked with this site before?  If so, what was your experience- getting paid, etc.?

I would definitely recommend this company! Its an easy site to use and they will send you free shipping materials if you need them. Also, their turn around time on payment is right on target. A++
