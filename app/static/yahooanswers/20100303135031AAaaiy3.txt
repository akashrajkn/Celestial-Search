Place to Upload Videos?
Is there a place to upload videos that are more than 100 mb since that is the limit to most video hosting sites and that you can also upload more than 20 mins.

I can answer this in two ways.
One: If you just want to upload a video file and somebody wanted to download it in another machine, you can upload the same in www.ziddu.com. It allow upto 200mb
Two: If you wnat to upload a video and sombody wanted to download it in another machine..more than 200mb, you can convert your video into torrent (hardly 20kb) ask them to download any torrent software and download this video...

If you need to upload the video for online viewing, i dont think you can do more than 100mb. Thre might be some pay sites which you may be able to upload more than that
