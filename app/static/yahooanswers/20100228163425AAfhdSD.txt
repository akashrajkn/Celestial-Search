Twitter via text message?
Help! How can I find the phone number to text for Twitter? I've been trying to twitter via texting, but I can't find it anywhere! If anyone has this set up, (For free), can they help me figure it out? *Also, does Verizon allow that for free?*

You need to register your phone online and then i think the short code that you text to is 40404..  i used to do this on my old phone before i got the droid..  and the texts will come out of your monthly allowance, whatever that may be..
