My Internet explorer cannot connect to Google? 10 points?
When I type in www.google.com, or click on the google link on my Google tool bar, It takes about 2 minutes and then comes up with a page that says: Oops, Internet Explorer could not access www.google.com. Then it has the suggestion to reload page, but that doesn't' work. I cannot sign into Youtube either because Google and Youtube sign in are linked. 

Every other website works for me and I can still watch videos and stuff. I'm using Internet Explorer 8 and Windows 7. Anyone had this problem before? Please help.

I left for a week and got back, still had problem.

Maybe it's because the server is busy. Just wait some time and than try again!

For me works fine though. But if every other website works, than the problem is coming from Google and not from Internet Explorer.
