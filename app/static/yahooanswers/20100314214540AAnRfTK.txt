What does Twitter do?
I know I sound like a dinosaur, but what does Twitter do? What is it good for? Thanks!

It's a way of keeping up with people and events. You post 140 character status updates on what you're doing, basically like a facebook status. You "follow" other people and see what they're up to. They can be friends, organizations or even famous people.
Ok, on Twitter you tell your family and friends [People who follow you] about what you're doing; in 140 characters or less. A bit more space than a MSN personal message.
@USERNAME at the beginning of whatever you wrote means it's to that person. It'l be a link to their profile. If you write @USERNAME in the message, it'll just link to them.
A RT or ReTweet is basically sharing what someone wrote. You click on the ReTweet button on the Tweet you want to ReTweet, and it'll show up on your profile, telling your followers.
That's the basics.
