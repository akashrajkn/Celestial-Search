If I use paypal for a craigslist transaction and list it as an item purchased, will paypal [rotect it?
I have been looking for these really rare action figures on ebay. I couldn't find them there or on amazon. So i searched google, and this guy in Chicago came up selling a lot of the for a grand total of $70. It's a really great price for these particular figures, but the only way I know to pay is with paypal (as i live in FL and he is all the way up in IL). When you send a payment on paypal, it gives you the option of business or personal. If you select business it asks if it is a bill or an item you are buying. If I say it is an item I am buying, will it be covered?

No. PayPal with craigslist is asking to be ripped off. Ask them to send it C.O.D.
OK I live in Chicago if you need to checked out let me know 

I use craigslist for so many things so I know about the scams....and if you want to know who I am do I have references. 

IM or email and if not me one of my friends or my daughter......we all use craigslist
