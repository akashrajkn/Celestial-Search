Free Laptop? Can it be done, please read question?
we all know the spam emails we get, but is it ever not a scam? I'm aware its never free, id like to find an offer that will guarantee said item or equally valued will be sent on completed participation. I've heard tell tale that people have gotten one with little hassle, but ya never know when this is legit or just fraud trying to hype that its real and possible. I'd like up to date info, the internet changes quicker than the times, and maybe some legit sites you've done this with if anyone has. Fewer offers to do the better also variety in offers. So is this real? if its scam tell me why, I've heard it all before and I've been doing research, if you say its a scam i hope you can at least tell me what site it was you used(or a friend or family). not just going by what you've heard(iv heard it all) I'm hoping something somewhere may be legit. I always read ToS and never use SSN if asked we all know that. And I want a good deal! I cant afford $100 worth of fees even if the items worth $1000. So gimme some good info, something I haven't heard. Thanks in advance for any info. Also maybe you know of a good site with like minded people probing these sites n telling if they're legit or scam. I know WOT n BBB but these dont always help..

It's always a scam.

With the amount of work you do to try to get this "free" object, you could easily have earned it at an actual job.
A lot of them, yes. But some of them are legit, the ones that have you fill out their sponsers offers. it was on the news one time but I forgot which ones were legit.
