why am I having problems watching videos and listening to music on the internet?
It started all of a sudden like 3 days ago and I;m sick of it, the videos on youtube take long as hell to buffer and so does the music, they start playing and stop every 15 minutes, what do I do? what's the problem?

Download CC Cleaner. It's a Registry Cleaner Software. There are a lot but try this fisrt and still it doesn't help, try Registry Cleaner Excert. 99% it works, sure.
