You are infected with spyware if:

* You see too much pop-up advertisements.
* Your browser has toolbars that you haven't installed.
* Your homepage has changed (and you can't change it back).
* Other settings have changed without your permission.
* Your computer is slow.

To get rid of spyware and keep your computer clean you can use an antispyware or even more. 
You can download a antispyware software.
