Multiple Tumblr blogs?
So, I have one main tumblr blog.  That was how it was for a while.  But today, I wanted to start another blog.  So, on my dashboard, I went over to the sidebar on the left, click the name of my original blog, and then click 'create new blog'.  I created it, even posted in it!  When I went back to my dashboard, it disappeared!  I don't know where it went!  It just listed my original blog!  Someone please help me.

I just asked the same question literally a minute ago I think maybe Tumblr is just tweaking right now. Since Im not the only one having this issue.
i have two blogs too.
that was a problem for me
BUT if you click on your tumblr username
underneth it, it will have a link to your second blog and when you click it it should
lead you to your second blog
but somehow your first blog will always be the default one
