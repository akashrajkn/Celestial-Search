Does Amazon.co.uk always apply Custom Duties?
Im in the UK, and would like to order a cd from the states, via UK's Amazon's Marketplace. However it says that customs duties may be incurred. Do they apply them? Or is it a 50/50 chance they may or may not. The cd is only ?5, however if duties are added, it will be ?15. So do amazon always apply these charges, or is it a chance I take? Thanks :)
Ordering from a Californian company if that makes a difference
I have read that page, however, it says 'may be subject'. So still doesnt resolve it : (

You should read the Customs Information Page on Amazon

Neither duty nor VAT is payable if the total value of the goods (not including shipping charges or insurance) does not exceed ?18 (?22, or equivalent in local currency).
I have ordered cd's & dvd's from the states to the UK from Amazon with no problem. just remember not to exceed ?18 per order.
