Chrome or Safari and why?
Im Looking for a real "light" browser but which is popular as well..im low on resources(i.e.CPU and memory-as i use a budget PC) and hence  this need.

Since you use Windows, Chrome is better as it has a smaller file size and it's slightly faster while Safari is just a port from Mac.
Chrome cuz its faster, very safe, and has a lot of cooler features than a basic Safari. 


Also, Safari sends a lot of information back to Apple without asking for your permission. It's not a huge deal, but some may see it as an invasion of privacy
Try slim browser or orca browser
As I suppose chrome is good for u as u r using windows¡­chrome is lil faster than safari and has a smaller file size.
