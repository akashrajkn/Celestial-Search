Where can i search pictures apart from google images?
My school banned searching on google images because google changed its laws so that anything searched on google images will be associated with any info involved with any key words used to find the images.

yahoo, photobucket
Flickr.com allows you to search for photos.  Most of those photos are public domain which means you can save them and do what you wish.
Bing images

Yauba is a good search engine with regards to privacy.  You can do image searches on it, as well.
