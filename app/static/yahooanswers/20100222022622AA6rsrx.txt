at first i wouldnt leave ie, but people kept talking about fire fox, i finally d/l it.  At first there were a lot of bugs.... a lot of places werent compatible with it, I'm not sure if it was the Vista i have now, but i do the upgrades and it only seems to get better, and all of the places that i had problems with it seem to be just fine.  I'm sticking with it, and it has lots of nice little percs that make webbing more fun and easier to find sites u go to often.  Give it a try. think u will like it.  you can always go back.  good luck
Firefox. Its safer, faster and much less buggy. And there is a lot of plugins for it!
Safari is generally the fastest of the lot, but it doesn't support much in the way of plug-ins.
Google Chrome, I have never used, but it should be very fast for stuff like Javascript.
Mozilla Firefox,-
