can you buy online with debit card?
I don't have a credit card, but I have a debit card can I use this to shop online, like to buy clothes etc?

Yup.
You can yes, just be warned that if you get ripped off, you don't get the same protections as you do with credit cards.
yes absolutely i do it all the time, and there's nothing you have to do different its the same as a regular card! have fun!!
Yeah, though it's more insecure than a credit card when making transactions. When making online purchases, you just pay as you would with credit. Just be sure you only make payments to secure sites.
