Are there any websites that are like craigslist?
My truck DIED yesterday. I mean everything basically shut down and now Im without a car. Craigslsit doesnt have any good cars in my price range so I wanna know if there are any other good websites I should check out.

This is an online classifieds site that I use. It is similar to Craigslist AND it's FREE!
