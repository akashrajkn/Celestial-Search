Do I need to pay the outstanding amount for domain registration?
Hi I have registered a domain name in one.com for $15. This company belongs to Europe. I have not used that domain afterwards. Next year they sent a post to my address and sent a mail that your outstanding amount is $43.In terms & conditions they specified like you have to send the cancellation request. Will it cause any major legal issues if I don't care about this. Need help please.

it seems you've been conned. Just send the cancellation request. It will be hard to avoid legal issues if you signed some kind of agreement. Or find a lawyer.
Cancel your account and register your domain with http://www.goldpuma.com or http://www.godaddy.com. Both are cheap and reliable services.
