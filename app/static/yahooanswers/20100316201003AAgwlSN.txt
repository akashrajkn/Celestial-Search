Help with Firefox toolbar.?
My mom was using my computer and when I get on I noticed, that the address bar was gone. So when I hit view to try and fix it I accidentally close my toolbar and I can't get it back I cant the File,View,Back or any of the other buttons. I can only see most visited and the my bookmarks which luckily I had Yahoo Answers there . I need help quick it's driving me crazy.

Thanks

P.S first one to help me get it back automatically gets Best Answer.

hm, try booting firefox into safe mode, just go to all programs-> Mozilla Firefox->Mozilla Firefox(Safe Mode) and just reset all settings, should be good to go
Press the ALT. key and it will show you menu bar. Now, click on View> Toolbars > Menu Bar. Then go to the same place and show the Navigation Toolbar.
I just did the same thing and the ALT thing worked!  Thanks!
