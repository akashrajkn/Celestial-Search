How can I avoid seeing naked guys on Chat Roulette?
Every time I go on Chat Roulette to legitimately use the service I see a bunch of men masturbating. Is there any way to avoid this? I don't really like seeing that type of thing.

Don't go there.
learn to love it.
i think chatroulette team are working on putting some filters on. so just wait..
Just use web-sites that require registration instead of Chat Roulette
Try http://nextplea.se instead, it's got a much better banning system that should let you get rid of the nudists! The video is much bigger too.
Donch, these guys are exhibitionists, not nudists.  A nudist doesn't surprise or force his or her nudity onto others.
