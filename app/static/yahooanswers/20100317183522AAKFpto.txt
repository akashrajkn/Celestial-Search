Grab your laptop walk around the street and try to pick up someones wifi signal if you are lucky you might not even have to leave your house.
wi-fi
I don't think you can with out cable or dial up.
You subscribe to your own ISP or go to a public library or similar place
you can try turning on your wifi and see if anyone around your neighbors is running their internet wifi unblock
if you have a cell phone with an internet plan, you could use the phone to get internet on your comp
the theory is, if your already paying for internet on your phone, you wouldn't have to pay for it on your comp
