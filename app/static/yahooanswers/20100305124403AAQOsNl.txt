how do you stop some one from listening to music online?
my sister likes to listen to online radio and it drives me nuts how can I slow our internet down enough so she cant stream music.  I was thinking of blocking the website with our router but is says blocked by netgear and I don't want my parents to start suspecting me.  we have a laptop on the network.(I Don't know if that helps)

Uninstall her sound card drivers. lol
Tell her to lower the volume. Don't be a jerk, that's childish.
Buy her a set of headphones. 

Compromise! as someone said, don't be a jerk. She has a right to listen to music if she likes, why would you want to make her feel sad?
