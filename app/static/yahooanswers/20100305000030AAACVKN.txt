How Can I Watch American TV Shows in Another Country?
Every time I want to watch an american tv show something like this appear: Thank you for your interest in The CW. This service is currently available to viewers living in the United States.
What can I do in that case?

You simply cant unless you get American Sattelite or something.
Many US network channels put their shows online, accessible from their own website (CBS, ABC, NBC,) also Hulu.com and many others.  You might not see it "live" but they're out there.
