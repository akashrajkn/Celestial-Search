Does an eBay gift card automatically pay the seller over ebay?
I have a $30 order and they have gift cards for $30 bucks, when I hit pay now, do I hit redeem code, I have paypal, like it says, will it pay the seller automatically?

Yes it will pay them automatically. There may be a option to use the $30 credit , and just click on that and it pay now.
You uimput code in paypal before clicking confirm payment buit after clicking pay now.Then cliock update and total will update.
