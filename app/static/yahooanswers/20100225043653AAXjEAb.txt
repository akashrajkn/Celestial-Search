I have a question about a website I would like to make.?
Do you think a website that allows users to sell and buy gift cards would make me a fortune.  The way I would make money is I would charge the seller a small fee after his/her gift card was sold on the site.

Adding fees for a transaction made online as a convenience sounds like a good idea, but with gift cards it may not be. Thanks to the brand neutral stores without markup such as CVS, Walgreens, WalMart and Target - places people shop frequently for every day items - their convenience to purchase is actually expanding. Gift cards are face value only and their price does not fluctuate with supply and demand. 
To establish a website that will process secure transactions takes a lot of money to set up and a considerable amount to maintain due to the relationships you will have to build with companies that will process the credit cards that will most likely be used to purchase on the site. You could use paypal and reduce overhead, but that would cut your target audience by quite a bit.
