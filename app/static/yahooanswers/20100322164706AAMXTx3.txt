How do I connect to the Internet.......?
I have a NETGEAR router for my laptop, and I accidentally disconnected it. Now when I try to reconnect it says I need a password.
I do not know the password. The Internet company didn't set it up, my dad did. 
Could I call the NETGEAR company and ask for the password or something?
What can I do?

Thanks!

Yes, call netgear, they should be able to help you. I had the same problem and they sorted me out in no time. Good luck!
