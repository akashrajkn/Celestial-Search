please help

thanks in advance

what you got to do in your revision, is add international rates, look up price on usps, ups, of fedx and get international rates, I usually use international express $28.95
First, you need to know how much the item + packaging weighs. Then look up the shipping cost on the USPS web site (see link below) and calculate the postage. Then revise your eBay listing (or answer the question so that the answer is added to the bottom of your description).

First Class International is the cheapest rate but only goes up to 4 pounds. 4 pounds and over MUST be sent Priority International or Express International. Tracking is only available on Priority International and Express International, not on First Class International, so you may want to keep that in mind. Insurance may only be available on Express International (I forget if it's available for Priority International, sorry). Lots of things to keep in mind!

And don't feel obligated to ship international if you don't want to!
