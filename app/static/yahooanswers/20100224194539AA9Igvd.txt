How can I delete my Yahoo! Answers account?


Why would you want to? You'll miss out on all the fun! :)
You have to delete your email and EVERYTHING else along with it. There is no way to delete just your Yahoo! Answers account alone. :\ Sorry bro.
* Go to yahoo answer.com and log into your account.
    * Look for the "Help" link, which is in the top right of the screen under the search box.
    * Choose the "Account Configuration" link under the "Using My Yahoo! Mail Account" section of the main Help page.
    * At the bottom of the page, you'll see a section called "Closing My Account". Choose the "How do I close my account?" link.
    * Follow the instructions on the screen to close your Yahoo account.
Well dude.  I thought I was going to be able to just whip though my profile settings and find a place to do a delete.  But I guess there isn't one.  Or maybe I'm not knowing where to look (probably).

I know there is a way to do it because I have clicked on old contacts and seen the message "oops this account is gone" or words to that effect.

I would try and contact Yahoo support on this one.
