What is "mts"?
Call your Internet Service Provider and explain the situation. They should be able to sort it out for you.
@knowguy: MTS is a Canadian ISP.

On the webpage, it says call this number if you have forgotten your password:

If you have forgotten your MTS internet password please dial CALL-MTS or 225-5687, choose the Internet option and request a password reset. You must have authority of the internet account to do this.

If you're referring to your router though, you can just restore the router to factory settings if you forgot the administrative password. I think you're referring to your MTS account password though, which I suppose only MTS itself can reset.
