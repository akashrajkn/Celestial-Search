Can a online webshop require a photo of your ID card ?
Hi! i am buying a game from an online store, and before they send it they required that i sent them a scan or a photo of my ID card / driver lisence, is it legal to require this for a sale? the transaction is already made.

No do not do this.

I have bought hundreds of games online and this has never been asked of me.
Don't do it. That's one way that identity thieves work.
