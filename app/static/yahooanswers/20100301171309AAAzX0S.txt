which browser is faster and safer google chrome or oprea?


opera
The new Opera 10.5 (http://www.opera.com ) is the fastest browser, but just a little bit more than Google Chrome (http://www.google.com/chrome ). It also has a lot more features than Chrome. I think that Opera is safer too, since it doesn't have the name 'Google' around it.
Fire Fox is bloated, slow, and a memory hog.  Opera is a very safe, fast, and amazing browser.  Nothing comes close to it.  All of the other browsers copy Opera's features and push them to the users as extentions.  Opera comes with everything you need, and nothing you don't.
