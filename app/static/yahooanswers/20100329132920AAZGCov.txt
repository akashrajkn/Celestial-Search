Any web-site i can write my opinions on pretty much everything?
Like a paper column, you would say blog but that focuses on one main topic. And i want people to read. Topic is pretty much everything. My random thoughts. Not short ones like twitter too, long columns like ones on paper.

ok, nevermind, try just going to a blogger website that you like. Most of these will be [something].wordpress.com or [something].blogspot.com
