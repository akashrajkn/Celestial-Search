Why was my sporedum.net account suspended for no apparent reason?
I made an account only a week ago, making only 2 posts about saying something random and a comment on a mod saying that it wasn't working. I go to check if someone answered the comment, but it showed a page saying "Account Suspended; This Account Has Been Suspended." Why did this happen? This makes no sense.

The actual website itself was suspended from the service used to create it. That's all that's known at this time.
