How do I cancel my @AIM.com account?
I can't really find a way. It would be really helpful if I had a link or something seriously, it's kind of hard to delete it >.<!!

Not possibly. Just don't use it or else you can try contacting aim support.

forget it
yes there is no way to "cancel" it. you can make it get suspended but that's the closest to canceling that it would go to.
