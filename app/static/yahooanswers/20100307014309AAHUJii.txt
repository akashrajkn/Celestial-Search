Do you like to tweet?
i do, i use twitter sort of as a diary lol.

nope never used it
i do but i never have anything to say
haha yea i also call it my public diary. :)
No I`m not interested in stuff like that....
Yes! not that I LOVE it. But it does become addicting once you tweet for a while, and have friends on there you can tweet with.

Also, I role play with a twitter account. It's really fun.

Sometimes I hate the 140 character limit, but I guess that's what makes it more creative and fun.
