Is there any way to tell if someone has been using InPrivate browsing?
I don't need to know the content, just if it's been used.

I don't think you can. As the name suggests, it is for private browsing so if someone could find out you used it, it would defeat the point.
There is no way to trace if the InPrivate browsing feature has been used or what for, all history is immediately deleted.
