What is via ground? Someone please help?
So I want to buy some zippo lighter fluid from amazon but I don't know what via ground is. Is it ups or usps?

Just out of curiosity, can't you buy that at a regular store?

To answer your question, it could be either ups or usps (United States Postal Service) But "via ground" translates to "slow", because it will not be transported by air. It has to get to you by ground travel.
