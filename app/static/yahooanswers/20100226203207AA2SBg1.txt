Trouble signing into AOL?
About 5-6 hours ago I attempted to sign into my AOL email address, but it wouldn't let me on and said that the password or screen name was wrong. I tried a couple of times just to make sure I wasn't making a typo. I also tried to sign onto AIM which has the password saved. Nothing worked. I called a friend and got him to try signing on for me and he was unable to. However, in the last hour or so it has started working again.

I'm curious as to whether other AOL users have experienced this recently, or if perhaps I should be worried about a hacker.

happened to me also, but after restart of computer it worked fine. if your worried about a hacker change all your passwords, and run virus and spyware scans.
