My computer had a virus, now a lot of files won't open.?
I had a virus on my computer. When I finally got rid of the virus, the computer wouldn't open a lot of my .exe files. I have to look each one up and "open with." I've tried to go to a few places in control panel to fix it, but some things in control panel won't open. It'll say rundll32 error or couldn't find association with file. My computer is a Dell laptop and it's Windows Vista. Please help, this is very frustrating.

try a registry cleaner... sounds like a reg problem (CCleaner is good/free)
That sounds like one effect of the Vista Antispyware 2010 malware (among other aliases) that's rampant right now. Two points about it:

First, this procedure might fix the problem with not being able to run programs:

1.Click the Start->Run menu item.
2.In the text box, enter 

cmd

and press Enter.

3.In the ¡°Black Box¡±, enter

ASSOC  .exe=exefile

and press Enter.


Second, look at these two links (Warning:  they're rather techie):
