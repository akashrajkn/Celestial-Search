Anyone good at finding stuff on the internet?
I ordered something from a chinese website. Things aren't going very smoothly. Anyways, after sending my item AGAIN, they gave me this second tracking number and after two days it's still showing up as "No information available". Obviously the company I purchased from is saying the information is not yet up to date and to check regularly. This is the website : http://www.ems.com.cn/english-main.jsp 

It looks shoddy to me. Anyways, I don't believe these assholes anymore and I want to reach the EMS Courier company to figure out what's happening before I file a paypal claim. Nothing besides a 5 digit number only reachable from china is in their contact info. Anyone any good at searching and finding stuff :))) It would be very helpful to have their email! Thanks!

After reading all the results of messages posted on google I have concluded that you have been scammed.  I suggest you dispute your payment with Paypal.
