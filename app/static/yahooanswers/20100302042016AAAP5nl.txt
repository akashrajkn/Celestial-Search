we are unable to install new internet explorer 8-9?
we are trying to install internet explorer 8 what to do?

If you're on an older computer like myself (Windows 2000), you won't be able to install.  The platform won't support it.  I had to load Firefox.  My only other option was to update my platform to XP.
I never uninstalled my present one, I just downloaded this one.

                       Internet Explorer 8

I read some where that xp is out dated and IE 8 will not run on it If you are bumping in to dynamic link library, it is refusing to download, and until you pass the WGA, it wont download.
 IE6 will download, though, and with fire fox, I get plenty of speed.
It would help to know what version of Windows you are running, and if you have a previous version of IE already installed.  Then we can diagnose the problem more succesfully.
Thanks,
