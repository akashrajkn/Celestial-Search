Is it possible to win prizes through those survey ads?
We've all seen these things a million times, offers that seem too good to be true. "Click here to claim your PS3" or "You just won a brand new OVER 9000" flatscreen HDTV!" Can you actually obtain these wonderful prizes?

I tried a couple of times on those sites and all they want is your personal info so they can sell you other things. When you click on you have to take some sort of survey &if you answer yes to any question it goes to another site and before you know it the original reason you went there is totally lost in the shuffle. It is all too time consuming & as we know "nothing is for free anyway". MO
no most of the time it is spam
surely it is.many dont believe this thing because of 90% scam websites on the net related to surveys.well if you wanna try,give a try to http://www.imbrickingit.com/ ..it does not charge you anything so there is no harm in trying.hope you will be satisfied after trying.thanks :-)
