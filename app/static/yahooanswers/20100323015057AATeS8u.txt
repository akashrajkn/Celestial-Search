Login to your tumblr account

from the dashboard select photo and upload from your computer; there is also a built-in app to take a snap of yourself.

Have fun.

OK Sorry! I think I misread your question. You need to edit your Description by visiting the Customize area and clicking the info tab

you can add HTML code directly to the description box (or upload a photo) but you will need to host the photo somewhere - most free hosts will also add an advertising banner. Remember to choose your theme before clicking SAVE.

Try uploadr to host your PIC - you can copy the HTML code directly and paste it into the description box
