why do people use sendspace?
I'm confused, a lot of people uses sendspace for sharing music (in mp3/m4a files) while in my opinion a lot of other things are better, preferably mediafire. you can't do multiple downloads at once on sendspace and the speed is pretty low for me. is this just because i doesn't live in USA, does sendspace actually have better speed there or is there something else i'm missing?

Because people don't know what you know
