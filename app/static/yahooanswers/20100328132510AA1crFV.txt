How to set your chat roulette to a picture?
On chat roulette sometimes it doesn't show people's faces it shows a picture or something that looks typed or something like that. How do they do that?

You're on Chat-Roulette? Get off there dude. If you ever want someone to hire you, take down your account now. A quick google search of your name and they can find you on there, even with a fake name.
ok for the last person , you don't sign up with your name *facepalm* and download "manycams" it's free to get and use since it's an opensource program just google it and download from their website... the rest is easy
Just use vurtual web-cam software. It allows to show images, videos,... instead of your web-cam
