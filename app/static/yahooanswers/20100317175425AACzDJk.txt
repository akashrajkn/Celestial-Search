How do I get rid of the fbssearchproviderie8.exe error that keeps popping up everytime I log onto Windows?
I've disabled a toolbar associated with Facebook thinking this would fix it, but I still keep getting the pop up. There are 3 users on the computer and it only shows up on 2 of the users when they log on. PLEASE HELP! Thanks!!
