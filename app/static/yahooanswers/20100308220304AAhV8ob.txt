How do i submit my stories to deviantart?
I am currently making a story for a little (i guess here in america you would call it a 'cartoon') anime/manga thing. i wanted to send it in to deviantart because then i could send the chapter's corresponding cover pics as well. But it would seem im a noob at deviantart. how do i submit stories? (i need really good detail as i have almost no idea what to do here.)

Well, ya know how to submit stuff? Well then you just click on 'submit text' where the usual loading dock for them is :) sorry if it's not too detailed, no one answered and I'm in a rush
