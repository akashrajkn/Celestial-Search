How do I open up my Limited PayPal-account?
6 months ago, PayPal limited my account, so that I couldn't send money.
I have tried scanning my bank-account and my passport, but the still don't open the account.

There was a system message from them saying that they thought there were unauthorised access to my account, but there really isn't.

So how do I open my account again?

It's really annoying cause there's loads of stuff I wanna buy on Ebay, but I really can't without PayPal.

Are you sure they did, this sounds like one of the spam emails I get quite regularly. Have you actually tried logging into your account and seeing what is going on? 

You just need to ring them, the number is in their help section. I've contacted them on the phone a couple of times about various problems and they usually sort it quite quickly.  If they do limit your account they send a code to your bank account and you have to check your online (or paper) bank statement and email this code back to them if i remember rightly. I vageuly remember sending a scan of a household bill with my address but I could be wrong it was a few years ago this happened.
paypal is a very safe method of payment. I have friends and a lot of time dealing with it. Were safe. We often called www.usd11.com in a web site to buy things. Filled with a lot of very full.
