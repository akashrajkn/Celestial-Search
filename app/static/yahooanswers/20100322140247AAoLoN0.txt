What little known sites do you think deserve more attention?
I reckon personally that emotionr.com has the potiental to become a very popular site. I am a regular user of it and I love the site but I think it would be more of a fun experience for me if more people joined and were active. What about you?

www.geekologie.com   if you are a geek or a tech nerd.. you will love this website.
