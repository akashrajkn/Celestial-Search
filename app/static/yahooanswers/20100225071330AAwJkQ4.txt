How do i avoid signing up for amazon pro?
I'm getting my debit card in a week and plan and doing most of my shopping online, my friend said when he bought something off amazon it charged an additional $80 for amazon pro or something. I mainly plan on buying used bluray movies and xbox 360 games. How do i avoid this mystery $80 dollar charge?

Don't click on the link that says "upgrade to Amazon Pro".
Your friend is a fuckin idiot so leave him/her who does not understand anything about computer. You'll be betta of with your self. You will be saved from the gods of computer idiocy
