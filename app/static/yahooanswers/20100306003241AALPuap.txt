Does anyone know of any eBay alternatives.?
I HATE eBay's fees and am looking for something that has the spirit of Craigslist with an auction style platform.  

Any suggestions?

Try IOffer.com, I do well there and fees are low.
Look into mondro.com. It's new but growing. And there are no fees at all.
amazon!!!
