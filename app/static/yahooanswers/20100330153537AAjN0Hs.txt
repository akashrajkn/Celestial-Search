Weird virus please help!?
this security tool thingy came up and i never downloaded it. it won't let me open my own anti-virus thing to scan it or anything. i have avg. but it won't work because when i click on it the security tool window comes up. what am i supposed to do? my mom will be so angry. please help how do i get rid of these viruses?

ha the EXACT same thing happened last night, it's a scam
1. look through files and stuff and delete anything from security tool (if you cant find any it doesn't matter really)
2. restart your computer and try to run it in safe mode(F8) 
3.if you got security tool pop-ups when you log back on open task manager (ctrl+shift+esc) or (ctrl+alt+delete) try holding them down and clicking 'end task' like crazy
4. if that worked pop-ups should be temporarily stopped and its safe to remove
5. now you can start you stopzilla thingy, system restore, or go under control panel's add/remove thingy, find it & remove it


:P stayed up till 5am trying to figure it out

this should temporarily hold it 2gether but i suggest getting an anti virus program in the near future
if yur internet explorer doesn't work you should use google chrome instead for a while

i also had this on a different computer and my mom made me leave it off for a few weeks(of course i snuck back on a million times a day since i learned it was a virus only last nite, but it eventually left, i dont think recommend that

also try to avoid clicking on the popups that can make it worse, just pull up the task manager

hope i helped, Viel Gl¨¹ck!
