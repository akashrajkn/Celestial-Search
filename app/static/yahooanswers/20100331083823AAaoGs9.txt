paypal add funds first or after?
ive asked paypal and didn't get the answer i was looking for. If I want to purchase an item from ebay using paypal do I have to add funds to my paypal account first or does paypal automatically take it from my bank account after I click buy it now?

They take it from your bank account, I believe they call it an E-check.
When I set up my paypal account, I had to give them my bank account number and a credit/debit card number. You can set it up by default which one you want them to take it out of, I always have it taken from the bank, although my debit card is also from my bank account.
