Please help me watch a show on-line!!?
I had to shut off cable because my husband would just watch the tv when he should have been watching our children, so since then I have been relying on the online shows to take abrief  break from everyday crap and lately it has been army wives and The bachelor that I have been wanting to watch, but they are not working anymore.  I can get them on my screen as before, but the keep needing to buffer I think.  The shows pause every 10 seconds or so to "LOAD" apparently whatever that means.  Anyway, now my huband is in Iraq, but I am keeping the cable off to save money, but I cant watch anything with my computer this way.  It use to work fine.  I set my control settings to med-high.  Itried deleting all the cookies, but it still did not due much.  Ihave a fairly new computer (bought it last year-gateway laptop) Please I just want a break to escape the kids, deployment, etc., can anyone help?  Oh and I have att internet service my speed is the lowest to buy but with my new computer should this be happening? Give me ideas!!
