I Need A New Website, Suggestions?
I have been using Testriffic, But it's just crap now. Quizilla is alright but not to great. What are some other good reliable websites that you can post poems, stories, socials(like messege boards) and that you can create stories. Meanwhile you should be able to add friends and stuff like that:) 

Thanks in Advance.

You could try out ning.com

There are hundreds of communities and it's super easy to setup your own
tumblr.com
http://www.webs.com/ is a great site thats where I MAKE MINE
I guess you could try Inkpop.com

BUT they are stricter on how long your stories are. They books are amazing. It's like a more sophisticated Quizilla.
