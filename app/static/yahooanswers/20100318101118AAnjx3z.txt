where can i get a free custom email?
i use to be with a website where you could choose your own custom domain of your email address...

like Sim@ilikedogs.com

or
 Sim@peoplearecool.com

but i dont remember the name of the site... anyone know?

I think you may be referring to AOL, they have that service
