What does the phrase "have an internet mean"?
I've seen this used on blogs, etc a lot.

it means you did something, so you get rewarded with 1 internet, the internets form of currency
You have one or you wouldnt been able to send this message or play this game. You need an Internet to be on line.
It could mean one of three things:

1) The author is not a native English speaker and has made a small grammatical mistake. The author probably would have really meant something like, `to have Internet access`. 

2) The author is not familiar with the concept of the Internet.

3) The author is a /b/tard and is using the expression in a new context. For example, if you were to provide me with warez and I wanted to express my gratitude, I might say, `Over 9000 Internets to you, good sir`, regardless of your biological sex or established gender role.
