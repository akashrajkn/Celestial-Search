Chatroulette - webcam questions?
I'm on a macbook, using my inbuilt iSight webcam.
Is there a way to make the image 'mirrored' on chatroulette? like it is in photobooth? And is it possible to make it black and white aswell??

Thanks :D

theres a program a lot of people use called manycam.. pretty cool, u can do a lot on there. black and white, lots of effects. have fun :)
