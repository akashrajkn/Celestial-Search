How do I stop this Firefox pop up?
The pop up says:

"You have chosen to open <file name> which is a application/octet-stream"

and then it gives me the option to save the file. But I am not trying to download anything. It happens when I try to open links, especially when I'm on YouTube. It's very annoying. How can I fix this issue?

Just use Google Chrome, it's way better.
Exit Firefox.

In Windows Explorer, navigate to:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\greprefs
Open all.js file with Notepad.

Scroll down, and locate following lines:
pref("network.http.version", "1.1");
pref("network.http.proxy.version", "1.1");
//pref("network.http.version", "1.0");
//pref("network.http.proxy.version", "1.0");
In your browser click on tools, then option for setting pop ups, then set your preferences.
