I have several e-mail addresses on different websites is there a program that would check them all?
I have this problem, you see i use a lot of e-mails such as Yahoo, Google, Hotmail and str.... The thing i am searching for a program like AIM only so that i could add all of my e-mails and so that it would check them all and also work like skype or AIM for chatting. Well not chatting maybe but for a quick replies. The thing i just installed Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger and AIM and i don't know if these programs can already do that because i never used them before, but if they do than can someone please explain to me how do i add more of my e-mails to it?

there is a quick fix 4 you in windows live. on the left hand side click on manage e:mail accounts and you can put all your e:mails in there. i do it all the time
You can add other emails from other providers in Gmail.
Windows Live mail is an email client that can access web email accounts using what is called POP3
