How do you get the Inbox Dollars toolbar?
I just started to notice that in the current earnings page it shows a new thing called Toolbar Earnings. Do you get that at the beginning of your Gold Membership? Where can I download it? I need answers from people who use the Gold Membership at InboxDollars.
