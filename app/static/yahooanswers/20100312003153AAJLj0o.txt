What kind of email is @maryii.com?
I am about to email someone regarding a car they are selling but I noticed their email is very odd, because it's (i'm gonna bleep out the first part) ******@maryii.com. Could it be safe to email because I'm used to seeing @yahoo or @gmail, you know.

http://www.enom.com/  is the owner of this they are a hosting company. chances are the person that you are talking to has a web page hosted there and that this is their site email.
Hey there this person whom you are emailing too has a website called mryii.com and obiviously she has a web host for it .Now web hosts provide you with email address sucha sthe one you have written.She owns the site called maryii.com and hence she owns the mail address.Thats not the case with gmail or ymail cause we dont owngoogle or yahoo either.
Hey long time no talk! What you been up to? Ive just been racing and goin to school!
