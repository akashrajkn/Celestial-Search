Where can I download the bonus features of the Avatar movie?
Preferably in high quality

I would really like to be able to see the bonus features of this movie. I'm very interested in the design of movies and cannot find it to download. It's not out on DVD where I am
Not on youtube
Oh, I just want to add that I will be buying the movie, over here it's very slow for bringing out DVDs, and I'll have it downloaded until it comes out

You will have to wait until April 22nd when the DVD comes out. No one has it yet. So obviously you can't find it on the internet.
Nothing legal.
Illegal downloads put a serious dent in the profits from the movie making a sequel unlikely.  It is the revenue from sales (DVD's etc.) of a new/current movie that provides the money to make the next movie - therefore no legal authorized download
