why is india backward when it comes to internet services?
USA, UK , japan,......... all have excellent internet services......but WHY is IND  poooor these services???????(i.e low speeds or high prices for little higher speeds.....)

poverty and illiteracy
Most of the time people use to serf through their office/school/college and very less time remains to serf the net when you are in home.

Thus, due to less demand for personal use, high speed internet market is still unexplored.

When it comes to corporate use we have high speed internet connectivity at resonance price.
