why wont my aim sign on? has this ever happened to you?
i was on AIM perfectly like 10 minutes ago. and i tried signing on now and it says wrong password or screen name. im 100% sure that my password is correct because i didnt change it. caps lock isnt on either. i tried going on www.meebo.com and that didnt work either, so i reset my computer and tried both of them again. and nothing. what do i do?
okay can you tell me when its fixed.

same things happening to me... i'm sure its just a server glitch.
I have the same problem! I can't sign on through AIM or Meebo and I can't reset my password either. But I can sign onto another screen name that I have on both AIM and Meebo. I don't know what happened... hope this is resolved soon.

EDIT: I can sign onto AIM now. XD
