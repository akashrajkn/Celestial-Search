how to get picture off the internet?
i have a mac and i tried dragging the picture and that didn't work. I tried copying the picture and that didn't work. I don't have a right click on my mouse so that doesnt work.

anyway i can get this picture?

erm i dnt noe how macs work but there should be a right click button somewhere ... then you go to save picture as den its on your computer :)
Take a screen shot of the page using the print screen button on your keyboard. Then open paint, hit control+V and crop everything out except the picture you want. And then you can save it. It takes a lot longer but it's the only way I can think of to save a picture without right clicking.
you can't on any computer because it's not a picture, it's a flash object. you can get a screenshot if you want by hitting command-shift-3 if you want. then it'll save a screenshot on your desktop
Yep, I got it, when you give 5 Stars And 10 Points I will give the Link to download it...
