Swagstakes at Swagbucks question?
i just entered 3 entries on this $10 amazon gift card. before i entered it said 95 out of 99. and eve after my 3 entries it still says 95 out of 99 even after i log out and log in and refresh the page. why does it still say theres 95 entries out of 99 even though i put mine in? and the same for another amazon gift card that i entered in. also, what are my chances of winning?

your chances of winning are zero. you have no chance whatsoever.

the only one whoever wins those things is the company that sponsored the contest.
