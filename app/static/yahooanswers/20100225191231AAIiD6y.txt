How do I keep two windows open, but be able to click on one without the other closing?
Im trying to be able to keep Skype open, but still be able to be on the internet, without having to keep clicking it when it minimizes, after I click on something. Make Sense? No ahah sorry

Just size both windows to fit on half the screen and move one to the left and the other to the right and they shouldn't close.
Shrink the browser Window so that it doesn't overlap your skype window.
I've never used skype before, but if it is what I think it is, then press the button next to the x button that closes the window, and put them both side by side (not overlapping)
