Picnik premium.......?
Does anyone have a picnik premium account and password i can borrow/ use ? I need to edit a photo, but not all of the things you can do are there...

You can edit your photos online, since there are so many websites for photo enhacment, and they are free. The best one is
1. Funnywow - http://www.funnywow.com
2. Top 20 websites for photo editing - http://www.squidoo.com/photofunia-style
Hope it can help.
