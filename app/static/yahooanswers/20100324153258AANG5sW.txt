Website that forces you to keep typing?
I found this website awhile ago -- you have to keep typing, because the second you stop typing it starts to delete some of your work. I forget what it is called and I cannot find it on google, but its purpose is to help you finish an essay, overcome writer's block, etc.

Thank you!!
