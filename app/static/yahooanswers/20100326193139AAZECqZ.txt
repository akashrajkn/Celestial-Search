Yeah,, just got to find someone to hire you first.

Yes if you know how to use Remote desktop to login to your work PC at home or you can buy the same software you use for your work PC and install it on your home PC then send the work files to your boss when done.

If you enter data into a website with a web browser, then you can work at home. You just need the web address, password, and username.
Try mypc.com...you must set it up at your home computer and your work computer....what it does is it runs as a program on your computer via the internet so you can pull up all your documents and files from your work computer, to your home computer...if your worried about losing files, dont worry. mypc.com backs up your files on their servers so no worries...hoped i help

Maybe try:

they train you for free, show you what to do.
You could setup a blog or website, this is completely free. Once you have added some good content, you can start to earn money from advertising. I know you wont make a huge income from this, but it would get you started working from home.

Pick a topic which you are very interested in, and write a piece on that everyday.
Dear Piyush,

Of course you can.  Could you narrow the topic down a bit?  Do you want to find a way to earn money on the internet?  

I am an experienced internet marketer who is looking for people to give a little help to.

Please reply to this answer and let's get started.

I look forward to helping you.

Make your own blog and start writing posts. When you have enough traffic, add some ads and that's your start.
If you are any good with computers and know how to make fliers , posters, event bulletins -etc- many companies pay good for this kind of work.
