What internet browser do you like the best?
Just asking, I'm looking to find one that everybody seems to like and just stick with it. Thanks for answering!

I perfer IE8.  Firefox is quite good though and I think more people prefer it.
Chrome, then FF.
Google Chrome- search for it on youtube & you'll be amazed with everything it does! it even has incognito mode!
IE8 is very good. Its the only one I use.
chrome then FF
IE8 Rules!
Mozilla Firefox is the best ... :D
Google Chrome
I'm a Firefox user.  Haven't tried Chrome, yet.  Don't like Internet Explorer or Safari.
firefox
Google Chrome is the best.
Opera, I've always been a big fan of it and it's innovating features. It's also pretty secure, and different enough from IE, Chrome, and FF.

Chrome would be choice number 2.
All I can say is, I was an avid user and supporter of firefox.

until I heard about Opera 10.51

I was blown away. I was gonna just "trial" it and go back to ff most likely. but it turned out that I NEVER looked back.

Give yourself a week of customising it to ur liking and getting used to the AWESOME features that come with it and if you don't like it then, I give you my sincerest apologies.

It makes me wonder why more people don't use this browser.

It has been independently proven many many times to be THE FASTEST browser on earth. Plus, it is more reliable AND secure than Chrome. I really don't see how anyone can choose anything else. If they like the "look" of chrome, opera comes stock standard looking like it. I prefer the look of firefox so i simply checked a few boxes in preferences and voila.

OPERA 10.51

p.s. im not getting paid for this lol
