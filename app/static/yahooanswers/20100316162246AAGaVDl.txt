Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?
here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item, then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?

and question number 2: if paypal does pay me back for the 5000$ are they going to take legal actions against the seller? or are they just going to bite the bullet and ban him from paypal for life?

Report it to ebay and paypal!
Ebay is SCAM-FREE. So if you say that you never received the product, they will first send an invoice to the person saying to send the item. If they still do not, they take it to court. Which of course they win..
Paypal is just a paying site, nothing can be done with Paypal, your transaction was done on Ebay, so Ebay is responsible. Paypal doesn't know anything about your stuff.

They are going to take legal actions, but Ebay will be.

So you have to go to the item in your "bought" list. And send a report to Ebay, saying whatever you want.
