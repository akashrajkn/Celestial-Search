Can a person from another house look at your browsing history?
Just wonderin?

If the person came into your house and accessed your computer, then yes. 

If you're asking if someone who is just sitting in his or her own home can look up your browsing history without having access to your computer or network, however, then no, he or she would not be able to do that.
No. Not even if they were to be on the same network as you.

If they are on your computer they can see your browsing history, but that can easily be deleted in most browsers under options.
Absolutely NOT!
The only way to see another person's browsing history is if you are tied directly into a network and knew how to do it. If you are not a part of their network then their is no way they can "see" you.
The only other way is if they had direct physical access to your pc and hit the history icon :)
You have absolutely nothing to worry about!
If a person went in your home and went on your computer, yes.

If they were on their own computer they can but they would be illegally hacking you computer but to do so they would have had to send you a virus somehow or know your computer's ip address
