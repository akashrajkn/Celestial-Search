Is this a legit site or scam?

i'd like to purchase one of these but could u tell me if the site is a scam or if it's real? there are lots of acai berry sites that are scams, so im not sure.

All of them are a scam.. there's no proof that product does anything. 

Think about it.. Oprah endorses them and she weighs 200lbs.
Efficacy of the product aside, the site does not have a good reputation with Web of Trust:

McAfee's SiteAdvisor gives it a (dubious, in my opinion) green light.  See the reviewer comments on both sites.

Hope that helps.
do not take any diet pills any were they sell them?alot of them are not safe for you they can be harmful.talk to a doctor?you can exercise,stay away from fatty and greasy foods? drink alot of water.eat salads,fruits and vegetables.get some exercise video"s. good luck.also you are too young to be taken something to lose weight,unless you are with a doctor?
Don't sign up for anything that will capture your credit card details, i've been scammed before and I lost a lot of money! I still take Acai berry though but only from a reliable and trusted company called www.acaiberryslim.co.uk. No chargebacks, no signing over your life and the capsules are stronger than anyone else. Give them a try, call them and they will send you a free trial bottle. Acai will work for you but its vital that you have a balanced diet also.
