I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn's over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn't support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com.  He's kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it's been working all the time. I haven't been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it's supposed to. Once connected you don't even know it's there. It's not free but it works perfectly.
