yeah
Those websites make me laugh, because I use GNU/Linux, and my computer looks NOTHING like that. Hahaha. Viruses. Ha.
I went to the link and a message popped up claiming my system was infected. I just closed the page at that point. That's usually how they infect your computer with virus/adware/spyware etc., by clicking on such popups.  On the other hand - going to just xorg.pl took me to a site, no popup. But unable to understand the language of the site. I would still avoid the link you posted with the popup message about virus.
I have a mac! LMAO!!! XD
Nice try. I use an iMac.
