About how long until my order arrives at Walmart once it has been shipped?
Yesterday it said it had shipped. I know it says 7-10 business days. But what are your experiences? Has an order ever came early for you?
Thanks!

do not plan on their time being the actual time . I have waited for 3 weeks  before .
Yeah, usually 7-10 Business Days.
