What are some good sites for free stuff?
I'm getting addicted to searching for things that are free or super cheap. I've been on craigslist, I've tried freecycle, are there any other options out there?

Lockerz.com- My favorite! You must be invited, you can find automatic inviters on Google.

www.Swagbucks.com- It's ok, but takes a while.

MyCokeRewards- You get points for entering codes found on Coke product's caps. It takes 35 points for 1 free Rhapsody song, 3 points per average sized coke that they sell in vending machines.
Lockerz.com :) free invite at http://www.freelockerzinvite.co.tv

then there's FreePrizePlace- quick surveys for free prizes

http://www.freeprizeplace.com
Never use mainstream stuff like Lockerz as you'll get less rewards and in the long run it'll take more time, check out SurveysForShit, it's only got a small userbase so the Admin is very generous with points for filling in surveys. You can get all sorts of things, vouchers, et cetera. Check it out!
This is an incredibly easy way to get free stuff! Just refer friends and complete offers, and you get free iPods, iMacs, flat screen tvs etc. Just visit this link: http://gifts.freebiejeebies.co.uk/205596

Here's proof that I'm not messin' with you:
