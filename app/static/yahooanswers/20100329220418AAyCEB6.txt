Safari will not let me on a few websites; blogger.com in particular?
soooo, whenever i try to go on a few select websites it says this:
Safari can¡¯t open the page.
Safari can¡¯t open the page ¡°https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceL¡­ because Safari can¡¯t establish a secure connection to the server ¡°www.google.com¡±.

the same thing happened with my youtube sign in page.
i've gone through the question list and none of those seem to fix it.
how do i fix it?
THANKS!
