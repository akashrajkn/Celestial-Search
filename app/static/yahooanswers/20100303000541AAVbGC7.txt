Why isn't my purchases on Itunes coming off my gift card balance?
Today, I redeemed my $20.00 gift card and purchased a $4.00 application for my Ipod Touch.
But it still says $20.00 on my gift card balance. 
Does it take a while to update? 
Or has this purchase been charged to my credit card?
Should I contact Itunes?
They said that they deduct gift card balances first, then do credit card.
Does it make a difference, that I redemeed it on my computer, but purchased it on my Ipod?
Thanks!
I live in Australia, so I assume the gift card is Australian.

Please come take a look at, the answer is to do in them.

Not sure if you live in Canada but Itunes giftcards do not work for apps whatsoever in Canada. If you purchase an app with a Canadian gift card already credited to you account, Itunes automatically withdraws it from whatever payment form you have attached.
