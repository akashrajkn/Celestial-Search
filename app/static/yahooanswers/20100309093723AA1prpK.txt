Could anyone answer this,In Mozilla or any other browsers,when we click or open website,Unwanted adds and some?
hi

You have a virus causing the random ads if your getting them from every link you click on.
Use Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, ccleaner and restart PC...
you should use Antivirus or Antimalware that  block pop-ups.......
