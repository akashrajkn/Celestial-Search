Not getting turned on by porn?
I watch porn all the time.. I masturbate to it, but it doesnt turn me on? Is this normal?

try watching different types, besides not everyone likes it anyways.
how do you masturbate to it if it doesn't turn you on?
All people are different maybe your not as visual as you are physical or emotional
try different stuff but maybe you dont like it anymore you want something better like real sex with a person
There are so many different responses that people have to porn that there is no way to tell what is "normal". I'm sure you're fine. 

Scientists have done studies of people watching porn with heat-sensitive pads around their genitals. Some of the people reported that they weren't turned on, but the data said that they were getting hot down there. So it's possible to be turned on without even being conscious of it.
you need to change the motherboard and the CPU
You've probably just become desensitized to the type of porn your watching. Its pretty normal. Just...ya...change it up or something. lol.
