Quick! How do you use eco-panda giftcards?
I need to get a bathing suit while they're still on sale and before people snatch them up but i can't figure out how to use my swagbucks gift card!! i'm really frustrated. Please Help!

Did you get your code for the gift card under your account. if so first you place the item(s) you want to order into your cart. When you go to check out scroll down to where it says VIP, Gift Certificates or Coupon code. You will insert the code there and continue to checkout .
