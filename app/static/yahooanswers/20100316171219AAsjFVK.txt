Why is Failblog a .org?
I am just wondering why Failblog.org is a .org?

because its not a . com.
Because the .com was taken. 


I see that .com was registered in August 2007, .org was registered in May of 2008. 

I have a few .org's and .net's because the .com's were taken, but only because they are good keywords. Fail Blog is not a good keyword, so the company that registered the .org is stupid and should have found a better name for their business because now the .com guy has his page parked and is making money off some of their traffic.
There's a failblog.net as well (as well as a .com) so I'm guessing .org was the only one available :) 

There are not restrictions at the moment though, so they can use whatever they want.
At first the site might have had a free domain but when the owner could pay for an actual domain they might have just chosen .org Just a guess.
