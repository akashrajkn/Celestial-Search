How to get FireFox or any browser up first on reboot?
I want to know how to make my browser load fast on reboot. Most of the time, I only need the web browser but it takes ages because of other programs loading.

I hope to find a way to boot up and get web browser straight up. I have IE, and FireFox and I am running windows xp media edition.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Switch to Linux. It will boot faster and will surf the web quite well. You can make a dual boot system and still have windows when you need it.
If you want the browser to launch on boot, make a shortcut to it and drop it in the startup folder in your start menu
Right click on start -> Click on open. Put the ie or/and firefox shortcut in startup programs.
Your best bet is with Linux. Windows boots unbelievably slow compared to other OS's.
If you use your pc mainly to go on the net, i suggest installing an open source free operating system as a seperate partion on your drive like linux. Sounds dangerous and hard? No! Email me i will give you instructions. adamdevey@live.co.uk The OS is mega fast.
You can get your system to boot faster if you look for programs and services that can be removed from startup.

Go to: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup and remove program links you don't want.
Go to: C:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Start Menu\Programs\Startup and remove program links you don't want.
You can also try going to Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Services and looking for services you don't need.  Change their startup from Automatic to Manual to prevent them from starting at bootup.

You can also check to see if your antivirus is doing things like updating signature databases on startup and cancel those operations until you are done browsing then restart them.
