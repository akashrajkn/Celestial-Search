How many websites are registered on the internet?
By website I mean domain names, not necessarily blogs and pages within domains.

I suppose this is a hard question to answer, but I have wondered about it for a while now. Good luck!

What the hell is an internet?
999,999,999,998
more than the stars in the sky and people in the world. count them and you might get an idea
according to netcraft.com around 210 million
