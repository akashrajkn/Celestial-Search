How do I get Internet Explorer 8 new tab to look like Chrome?
How can I get IE8 to open a new tab showing 8 webpages I've been to in the past like Chrome does? It makes a quick "go to" so much easier.  Thanks!

See, apparently Chrome uses GoogleUpdater which hogs memory and I can't delete it.  I thought I saw IE copying the same ability but can't wade thru the instructions to find out how.

Why don't you just use Chrome?
