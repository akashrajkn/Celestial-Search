On bin weevils can you have two bin pets?
Because every time I go two buy another one it says " You cannot buy i bin pet AT THIS TIME"
btw it doesn't have capital letters in it i just put that in there because that is the bit i don't get.

I was sure this site is 13+...

I can guarantee that nobody on here will know the answer to this.
I don't think you can buy 2 bin pets I think that yur bin pet has to run away so then u can buy another 1 but i dno. xD lolz
Hi there,

You currently cannot get a second pet in the Bin.
However at Bin Weevils we've been thinking of introducing this options for tycoons in future.

Hope that helps!
