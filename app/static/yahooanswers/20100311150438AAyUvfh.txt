Is LucidDeals.com a reliable site to get an IPOD TOUCH?
They sell an 8gb for like $50 when its normally $200! But you have to do ONE offer it says, they arent bad offers, I mean if paying $10 for gamefly for one month can save me $140 then its definately worth it. But Idk, will it scam me, is there strings attached? Watsup, 10pts btw

i found this on another site regarding Luciddeals itouch offer:

This is definately a scam but somebody is lying. Lucid Deals would not complete the checkout after i had completed the CreditReport.com order, one of the services offered and required to get the "good deal," got a confirmation, user id and password. I called CreditReport.com, They deny having anything to do with Lucid Deals and say that their link was stolen. But they cannot answer the question: "Why would anyone send customers to Credit Report.com if they have no connection and get nothing in return.?"  Stinks.

Would love to hear from someone who actually got the deal offered by Lucid.
