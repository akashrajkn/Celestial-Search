Has anyone ever been on chatroulette?
If you don't know what it is, its like a website where you can video chat with absolutely random strangers. Its kind of an interesting idea, but I'm not sure...i'm usually too freaked out to ever talk to anyone, especially since i am a girl whilst 90% are probably horny teenage guys and half of them are just jerking off on camera. 

Has anyone had any good experiences with the website? I've heard some really crazy (good) stories about that site along with the countless bad ones, but what do you all think?

kind of a goofy site. can be pretty hilarious though. i never go on alone though just incase i get some creep. it's fun to go on with a friend though and kind of just talk to random people. but once you get some creepy kid jacking off i usually just make a stupid comment.
I was curious the other day, and went on by myself.  Bad idea.
Many of people just "next" you for no reason.
A lot of people will ask you one question, you'll answer, you'll both sit their for like 15 seconds, and then it gets awkward and you'll next them.
About a quarter of the cams are just signs that say "Boobs please."
Another quarter is guys jerking off.

So, it's probably more fun with at least one other friend - you can laugh at the crazy people rather than just being creeped out!
dont go
the first three people i got were just jerking off on camera
