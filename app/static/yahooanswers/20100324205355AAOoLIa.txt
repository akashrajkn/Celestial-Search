How can I get internet for just 3 months?
I will be living at my parents beach house this summer and there is no internet there. I am looking to get internet for my laptop and my friends laptop who will be living with me. I need it only for three months however, I was looking into the sprint hot spot thing, but you need to sign a two year contact. What are my options?

Hi!

I don't know how these things called in the US, for I live in the UK, but there are "pay as you go" MIFI routers for that. Mobile wifi as they call it here. When you buy one, and use it for 3 months and afterwards sell it, would be the best idea, I would think!

Good luck!
