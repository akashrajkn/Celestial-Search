My AIM is telling me I have the wrong password or user name, but when I go to change it it's wrong?
Today, I tried to sign on to AIM and it said that my password or username was incorrect. The thing is; I have it set to remember me AND my password. So I refreshed and tried to sign in again. It didn't work. After this, I clicked "Forgot Password?" so that I could change it. When I got to the page that came up, my screen name was already entered into the box, and I just had to enter the letters to the captcha thing or whatever... I am ONE HUNDRED percent sure that the screen name was right. Also; I am 100% sure that the text I entered to 'prove that I am human' was correct. After hitting enter, I got an error message on the page. "Not able to process your request. Please try again." So I tried again. And again, and again. Never worked. For some reason, I'm thinking someone hacked into my account, but that still wouldn't change my user name, would it? So I'm trying to figure out what happened and how I can get my AIM properly working. Please help, and thanks!

AIM is having some problems, sadly. I had the exact same issue.
You just have to wait until it finally blows over. It took mine about
an hour or so until it finally signed me in. I don't know how long it'll
be for you, but I wish you the best of luck.
Don't worry, you're not alone.
I thought someone hacked me too.
I'm so relieved.
omg i jus posted a question about this i thought someone hacked mine too, on my laptop it wouldnt let e see that captcha thing and it took like and hour for me to reset my password on my desktop and even tho i jus di that its still telling me i have the wrong username and password, but my old aol address is working jus fine.... hopefully we will be ok soon maybe its jus server problems??.....i hope
