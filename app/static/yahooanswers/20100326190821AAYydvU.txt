Weeworld Toolbar....?
Ok i might install the Weeworld toolbar on my computer
but im wondering can you ever uninstall or remove the toolbar
after you install it?
How do remove it after?

Yup... not hard to do at all
Yes just go to Control panel, 
Add remove programs,
Find the program and click uninstall.
