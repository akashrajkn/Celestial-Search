Hi,

My name is Ryan and I work in partnership with Cricket. There might be a few situations that may cause a slower speed connection. Has this been happening recently or has this been consistent since you started using the broadband to view videos? Depending on your location, building structure and connectivity, these could cause a slow connection speed. Perhaps moving to another location in you home may help. If you stream and/or download many movies or files, you may experience throttled speeds after reaching 5GB in one month of service. You will still have internet, but will be suitable for basic internet web browsing, email, etc. until the end of the monthly billing cycle.

If you still experience slow or no connection in other tested locations, I would recommend visiting your local Cricket store for more assistance. 

Best,
Ryan on behalf of Cricket
