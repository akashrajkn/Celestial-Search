what are some cool things to do on the internet?
for a chatty guy like me ?

facebook
Join a blog. If you have a hobby you can find one that relates to it. Watching or creating your own videos to share on online video sites is always fun to do. If you like video games, you could try one of the many free mmorpg titles out there. Just find an interest and google or yahoo search it.
theirs a lot of sites, blogs that have chat rooms are one, I myself like animetap.com however if you dont like anime you can also try myspace,youtube and other video sites
