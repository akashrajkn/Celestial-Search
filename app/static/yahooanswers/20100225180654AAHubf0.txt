Is everyone getting something? NO so whoever hates lockerz please agree and send this to every one you know. Please tell me why you hate it

lmao noob, qq moar!
I don't think they have ever really paid out in redemption.  I joined that site months ago and I am still waiting.  It's a scam.  Every time they SAY they have stuff in stock, it disappears before anyone can redeem it.  (very suspicious).  And this has happened 3 times already.

I would dump it if I were u.
Majority of people who actually claim they got something were either working for Lockerz or got the t-shirt which was a $1 shirt (at the most) that was free advertising for Lockerz so they just assume it's legit.  I don't doubt you can get prizes but they are VERY limited and Lockerz will try and screw you out of your PTZ anyways they can so they don't have to pay out.

Total scam = no
A waste of time = yes

Easier to work a few days and buy what you wanted with your own hard earned cash.
