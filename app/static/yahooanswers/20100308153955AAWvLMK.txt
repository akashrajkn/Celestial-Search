How do I change back to normal print size from very large?
All of a sudden, my print has gotten gigantic.  I want it to be normal size.

on your computer? well press Ctrl down, hold, and press the plus sign or minus sign.. or you can just hold Ctrl down and scroll (on your mouse) to magnify or whatever..
