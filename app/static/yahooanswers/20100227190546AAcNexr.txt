Can anyone suggest sites similar to Craigslist that are as popular?
Looking for sites like Craigslist that deal in classifieds by city, state, country, etc. Something similar to craigslist, and that has a pretty good level of web traffic. I love using CL, but lately I've been getting only countless junk and spam mails from fake email addresses trying to get my address or visit some site. Sick of the BS, just want to do legit deals.
