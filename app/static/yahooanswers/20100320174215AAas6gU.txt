What happened to Outspark.com?
Outspark is an online game company that has quite a few games that are free, however they allow people to buy game cards from stores like chevron and 711.  I play this game, Windslayer, and it's really fun.  It's always worked perfectly.  Today however, when I tried to log in, it said that an error had occurred and it wouldn't let me log in.  (I tried numerous times).  I tried going to the website of both the game, and the general website that lists all of their games.  It said this:
Sorry!

There was a problem handling your request.

We will resolve this issue as soon as possible.

Back to Outspark.com

When I click on the "Back to Outspark.com" link it takes me to that same page.  There was no notice of this happening beforehand by the Outspark moderators...  Does anyone know what's up?  Greatly appreciated!

Hopefully they went out of business.  That site was no good.
idk that happened to me too
This is not an unusual occurrence.
I am sure that they will have it back up in a relatively short period of time.
Actually the games arent down. 4 hours ago some players got dc and couldnt relog (the ones that got dc, relogged or anything else) because the launcher is down. The launcher and the website are down and thats why you cant log in. 2 hours ago they were fine again and some players logged in and in 5 mins they fell down again, i was gonna do pvp kq but i got dc 10 mins ago and now i cant log in either cuz the launcher isnt working but the servers are fine.
It's working now. :D

-edit... nvm. D:
As soon as I got dc it wouldn't work.
From what I have seen, there is a "500 Internal Error" or something similar to that. That means it is an error from Outspark itself. In a few hours it should be fixed. Hopefully.
shit, i bought the spark cash yesterday too, cant log in right now. and i can't get to the fucking web........TT.TT FML can some1 tell me wat is going on
