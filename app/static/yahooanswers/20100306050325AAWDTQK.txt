Do you think, this is slightly over the top?

what ya reckonb OTT?

Yes.
Just a fucking sore loser...
Yes
Over the top? I'd say it's ILLEGAL to post photos of that content without her permission. Good luck when the feds catch up with you.
With a bloke like that who needs enemies?

Actually he has dropped a very large bollock there! If as he says she took them then she owns the copyright to them.

So she could then get his site closed down and sue the ?rse right off of him for copyright infringement and compensation which could run into hundreds of thousands of dollars or pounds or whatever currency it is.

Bet he wont feel such a clever smug smartarse then!
aha
A little, but while he's done this already he might as well make a little cash from advertising.

Images like these are taken from peoples facebook and myspace accounts only to be posted elsewhere. I doubt that there would be any problem with law enforcement and would she really want to bring attention to this site?

Chances are he has no real money so what's the point in suing anyway?
what a wan ker this bloke is. shes a good looking girl, better off without him. ha ha his loss. he will have to stick with pam now   (palm of his hand)   lol ha ha ha
