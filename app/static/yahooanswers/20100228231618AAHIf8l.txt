Is it fair for Vodafone UK to do this (mobile broadband)?
Vodafone USB dongles have a connection speed of 7mbps if you're on a plan (contract) but only half that (3.5mbps) if you're on prepay.  Although Vodafone is currently the only UK provider to offer 7mbps, it seems unfair for them to deny prepay users that speed.

Yes it's fair; because they're the only one with that incentive, unless another competitor can match it up, like O2, or something, Vodafone dictates unfortunately.

Oh and by the way, I know 2 users shouldn't have more than one account; but come on, you need to help me bypass it.
