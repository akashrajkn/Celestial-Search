Can you help me to find my lost photos?
Few months ago i uploaded almost 7gb of photos/album in a photo sharing site. But i forgot the name of the site. 
Now i want all the name of photo sharing sites available in net. so that i can guess the site, Help me to find it out.
Correction:  Not 7gb its 2gb

There are literally hundreds of them.
Are you sure about the 7GB? I have several hndred pictures and it only uses 1.42GB of space
