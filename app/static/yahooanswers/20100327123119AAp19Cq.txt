my browser jumps or redirects me all the time.  How do I stop that?
when I type something in my browser my choices appear.  If I click on any of those choices I get redirected or jumped to someplace I didn't want to go.

There are known viruses which are infecting your Internet Browser making it redirect you to a malicious sites every time you click a link, I would suggest running a Anti Virus

Here are some Free ones.
Microsoft Securtiy Essentials (Microsoft.com
Avira (avira.com)
Avast (Avast.com)

Can also be you are using a fake browser, I suggest using one off these
Comodo Dragon (Comodo.com)
Firefox (Mozilla.com)
Opera (Opera.com)
Google Chrome (Google.com/chrome)
try searching for add-ons / plug-ins for your browser
Firstly, try deleting all your cookies, you can usually do this in your browser option, if that doesn't work download a new browser or reinstall the one you have now, then get yourself a good anti-virus like AVG or Avira Anti-Vir to stop malware from infecting your browser. By the way that's most likely your problem, you have malware or a virus on your computer sending you to sites you don't want to go.
