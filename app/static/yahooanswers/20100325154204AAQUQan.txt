Twitter question help please?
Hey guys, here's the situation. This post says:

@AlterBridgeFans hey guys! i havent heard what you all will do for an AB blu ray/dvd. use #wwyd4AB the winners get picked tomorrow!

I understand everything apart from "use #wwyd4AB"

I don't really understand what is meant by "use it". It is highlighted in the post and when I click it, it brings me to a page with everyone's responses, but when I type in the box to try and respond, and post, it just comes up with a status update and doesn't put my response in the list. Any help?

Tell him the craziest thing that you would do for a bluray/dvd player. Try to use that code at the end of your tweet so he knows you are doing it for the contest. Give it a shot! :)
