Virus issue, please help!!!?
I have a virus on one of my two laptops and it keeps popping up with xp defender virus detected pop ups. So im having geek squad come over to take care of it for me. My question is... Geek squad is not coming until over the weekend, can i still go on xbox live? its on the same network and the infected computer, but i disconnected it from the computer and shut it down (the infected computer). So would it be okay (safe) to still go on and use xbox live while one of my computers has a virus? Any input on my issue will be appriciated!

Screw geek squad.Why pay  them for something you can do your self
Yes.  A regular virus (what household computers get) will not travel to your xbox just because you have one on your computer.
