Why would you choose to chat on a mirc that required you to pay than those free chat room?
I used to chat on mirc in the past but later on when they required you to pay for registration I stop using immediately and then went on to chatandgo.

Why would people choose to chat on a chat room that required one to pay than to go for something that is free?

MIRC is software. The chat servers and networks have nothing to do with the fact that they charge for registration. You're paying for a license for the MIRC software.

IRC networks have always been freely open.
