Lockerz free t-shirt?
i know that to get a free t-shirt on lockerz u have to invite 20 friends. well my friend did that, they all accepted, and they haven't asked anything about the free shirt. so how do u get it? do u have to order it in the general redemption?

you have to go to your account page and enter your home address and t shirt size
