Why can't i sign up to childline?
i have been trying and failing to sign up to the childline website.
it will not accept any username i give at all.
i have been trying for hours now and all i need is to talk to someone.
this is really stressing me out.
does anyone know why this happens? is it happening to you or just me?
any help appreciated ?
