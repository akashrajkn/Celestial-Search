what is a free music file backup site?
I keep losing all my music files and its a hassle to have to re-download all my songs again, is there a online file backup that is free to use?
thanks! :)

Hello,

If you need a place to store any of your files on the Internet for safe access later then use 4Shared, it's a free online virtual drive; you can share your files if you wish or you can just keep them to yourself. It's free and easy to use and it keeps all your files safe, just visit http://www.4shared.com/ and signup to get started.
