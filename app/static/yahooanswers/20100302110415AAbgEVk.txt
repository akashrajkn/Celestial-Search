I keep getting re-directed to other sites when I open up my broswer?
Every time I open up my browser and search for a site and click on it, it send me to other sites.  I know I have mal-ware.  I ran ad-aware and malwarebytes which usually does the trick, but it doesn't seem to be getting it this time.  

Anyone know of how to cure this without having to reformat....again.  thanks

Run windows live scan.  Go to onecare.live.com.  This is a free scan and clean site.  It's a windows product so it does a better job at digging out malware and viruses in widows than most other programs.
I use spybot S&D from http://www.safer-networking.org/en/home/index.html which solves most problems.  Another thing you could do is google the site that it is sending you to (use a different browser than the one that's infected.)
Run Malwarebytes, SuperAntiSpyware, ccleaner in safe mode and when back in normal mode run Drweb Curit and Hitman Pro...
