What is the best bargain you have found on Ebay ?


I collect Marie Osmond dolls. Some of her dolls can cost $100 and up directly from the manufacturer or from other online stores. I have bought several of my dolls on Ebay much cheaper than I could have found them anywhere else. I have saved hundreds of dollars.
A new DVD for 5 cents (post was $5)
A designer top for $11.50 costs around $90 retail
An as new hard cover book for $4  RRP $65

Just some of many. :)
