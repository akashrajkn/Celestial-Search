You can try a "reset" but that will put your settings back to the way it originally was.

Tools >Internet Options> Advanced> Reset

You might try to clean the Cache file, (temporary files) to see if there might be to many Temp files which can slow down your system.

Tools>Internet Options>General> delete browser history.  You can try this first, before trying Reset and see it will help.  Sometimes, you just get too many Temp files and it clogs things up.

To keep those files cleaned up, In Advanced, >Security, look for  Empty Temporary Internet files when closing... and check that box.
