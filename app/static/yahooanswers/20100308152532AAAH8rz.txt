computer issues/verizon or not sure help please?
I'm thinking cookies or something like that need cleaned out of the browser or whatever, because the connection is slow and sometimes does not connect at all. I am not sure if this is a problem with Verizon's modem or what but I need some assistance. The operating system on this laptop is Windows 7 and I do not know how to mess with the browser in Google Chrome. Firefox has stopped working for us. Can someone help me out with my computer issues?
