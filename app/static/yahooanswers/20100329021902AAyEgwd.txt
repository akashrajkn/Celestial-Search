Moneysavingexpert.com?
Hello. Can someone do a step-by-step guide on how to use moneysavingexpert.com please?

My boyfriend invited me to join a while ago so I did, but I have only just wanted to use the site. I'd like to buy 2 dresses from very.co.uk

My boyfriend is away at the moment so he can't me help with this.
Thanks in advance.
