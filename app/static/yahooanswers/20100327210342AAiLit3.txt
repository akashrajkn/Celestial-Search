which hosting company?
i want to make a website and am looking for a hosting company with lots of space and transfer with good support at a competitive price

Honestly, http://www.blogger.com is amazing and meets my standards. I believe it's only 10 or 20 dollars a year and I'm also pretty sure you could have high amounts of traffic.
Here are some of the sites I feel as good one:
http://www.000webhost.com
http://bravenet.com
http://hostgator.com
http://110mb.com
http://www.ipowerweb.com/
I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They're also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.
As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
