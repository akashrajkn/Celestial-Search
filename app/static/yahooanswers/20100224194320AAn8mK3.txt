What makes the perfect profile picture to you?
facebook myspace what ever?

women nudity
Research has shown the when women posts self-shot picture (them in front of mirrors) at a downward angle (cleavage shot) more people are going to click on their pictures.

For guys, a topless picture will also get people to click more on their picture.

Of course though, if you weigh 600 pounds I don't recommend you pose with no shirt on..
