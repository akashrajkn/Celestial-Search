Where in the U.S does not have internet connection?
Someone I know is moving to somewhere without internet connection. I didn't know there was a place without internet connection. Anyone know anywhere?

Perhaps the Amish....Amish people don't even have electricity let alone the internet...

Also....The people living next to me don't have internet....Since it isn't free, not everyone has it...And I do know people that would connect to the internet for free....
lots of places >mountains or places with no phone or cable services
There are several places in the world that do not have a good enough instraucture for DSL/Cable/Fiber optic.

However I don't think its possible to go to places that doesn't have internet connection, there is always the option to use Dial-up (connects through phone lines), mobile broadband (connections through radio waves), and satellites (self-explanatory)
In theory everywhere could have internet but in very isolated places it would be very costly - by satellite. Also you would need electricity. In mountainous regions there might be no cell phone service either.
