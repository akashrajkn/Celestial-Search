Is auctioning domains on GoDaddy worth it?
Please only answer this question if you have auctioned domains on GoDaddy.

Here is the story. On GoDaddy, there is a feature where you can auction your domains. I have a pretty generic domain. Will it sell? How often to domains actually sell?

No, not worth it!
Yes, it is, however I would suggest being patient. Some domains don't sell for months.
