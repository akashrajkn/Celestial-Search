Unfortunately, I cannot offer a solution. I've experienced the same problem today. This happened after the AntiVir malware infected my computer yesterday. A couple of antivirus programs failed to detect any problem with IE 7. I tried two workarounds, both without any result. 1. Removing and re-adding the IE component to Windows using "Set Program Access and Defaults." 2. Downloading IE 7 from Microsoft (the existing copy was first removed by the download process). One of the two antivirus programs scanned the entire disk, without detecting any problem. A co-worker copied an executable to another machine on the LAN (which fortunately was mapped on my PC) that installed a different browser (Firefox). This browser does not exhibit the problem. Previously I had tried without success to download browsers and antivirus programs from the Internet. This very symptom prevented me from doing so.
