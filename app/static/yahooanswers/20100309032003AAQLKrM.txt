whats with all the penises on chatroulette?
Have you checked out chat roulette? Every other person is a guy masturbating- what the heck is going on??? Don't they have moderators on that site?

Most of the people on that site are either trolls, or exhibitionists (they get off on people watching them do "private" things).  It really is NOT a good place to meet people (well, NORMAL people).  You have a better chance using Facebook or MySpace.

I'm sure Chatroulette is moderated, but most likely only for content that is actually illegal.  Guys jerking off over a webcam, unfortunately, is not a crime.  Unless it's being shown to minors.
