MP3 download sites help?
Which do you find the safest to use?
Please don't say Frostwire, because I have it, and it is currently not working.

It's not really advisable to download MP3s because in most cases, it is illegal. 
Either buy the music or try a free music source like Newgrounds audio which is full of non-published and talented musicians who create music in every genre.
