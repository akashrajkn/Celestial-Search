What to talk about in my blog?
If I'm discussing "how to help people", world issues and the like - what topics would you like to see blogged about? Also, could you have a look at it and see if it's okay? outsideyourbubble.wordpress.com I just don't know what to talk about or if I'm on the right track :(

yes
Best advise I can give you from my years of experience would be this.

Find something you are passionate about and blog about that.

Don't worry if it's something someone will read, just do it for yourself.

I know 1 person who turned his hobby of raising chickens into a very popular blog that is now making him money.  Now this didn't happen over night of course, it took about a year before things really started to happen, but since then it has simply got better.
