I need help with RapidShare.......?
I want to download a RapidShare file, it's not the first time i use RapidShare but first time i have a problem like this.
When i click "free user" appears:
"You have reached the download limit for free-users. Would you like more?
Get your own premium account now! Instant download access! Or try again in about 14 minutes"
but i have 2 weeks to download a file.......
I wait 14 minutes and trying again but this time i take this message:
"Your IP address 91.138. . is already downloading a file. Please wait until the download is completed."

It's my computer's problem or RapidShare's fault?
Does anyone have any idea why this is happen and how to fix it?

Thanks in advance :)

It is very common!!

just wait for sometime..then u can download again!
yeah...i've experienced that before...its rapidshare fault...
but why don't use other servers like hotfile or netload or megaupload or deposit files.....if at all the file you're tryin to download is stored on other servers too.....
and if you wanna try links with resume capability for free....hit me up...i'll tell the procedure...
its a bit lengthy....
It's a common error.
It happens most of the time when all Rapid Share servers are full
The easiest and the fastest way is to get a premium account!!!!
