Which one is the best antivirus software for protect net from virus ?

I have been using the free Avast program for years.
I've found AVG to be very good as well.
I've never used an anti-virus program.

LOL!
When I have a question like this I go to the experts. There are great reviews at:

www.pcworld.com

www.pcmag.com

I personally prefer PC World. I get the feeling they're less influenced by their advertisers. But, who knows. This year, based on the review at PC World, I'm giving G-Data Total Care a try. It has a free 30-day trial. Here is a link to the review:

Thus far I have found their claim to not suck up system resources to be false, but they come a lot closer than any AV software I've tried. I also like the fact that they use two different virus engines to really weed out all the baddies. Its almost like having two antivirus programs in one. But no matter which you choose, read a few reviews first. You'll learn a lot.
