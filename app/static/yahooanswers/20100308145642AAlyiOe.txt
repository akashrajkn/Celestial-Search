how long is amazon FREE Super Saver Shipping?
has anyone recently bought anything from amazon using free shipping??

how long does it take to deliver??

It's pretty good. The arrival time varies a bit - I ordered the Devil May Cry 5th edition boxset a few months ago and it arrived within decent time, like five days or fewer. I was surprised and very pleased. On the other hand, I have ordered a few things and it took roughly one to two weeks. That may have been because the product was in low stock, but it wasn't too long. 
I like Super Saver shipping because 1) I'm not terribly impatient, and 2) it's FREE! Some items' shipping costs are more than the item itself, but if I do Super Saver shipping, it knocks that down. 
Hope this helps!
