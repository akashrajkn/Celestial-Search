Should I use Google Chrome or Firefox?
I love my google chrome! But my friend told me now that you can also change the firefox theme, and that firefox had more than google chrome themes. I found right on the front page that firefox had a Slipknot Joey Jordison theme, which is AWESOME! For me both browsers are lightning fast but I need to compare and see which one to stick with! Any suggestions? Or you can name other browsers that have themes if you want.

Google
Firefox.  Chrome is horrible.
You're friend is correct, Firefox does have more themes, and they look a lot nicer than the google Chrome theme. Firefox and Google Chrome is about the same speed on switching sites, but I do feel the Chrome is more responsive. What ever floats your boat.
Firefox
I say google chrome. It's newer and that means it has so much more to offer. It's much better than firefox. After all, what is a theme really important for when it comes to fast, problem-free browsing? Google chrome is so maximized anyway that it barely has any room for a theme.
As far as i know, Google Chrome is better by speed.
Altrought, Firefox has many of Ad-ons and themes. 
So it's your choice: functionality, or speed :)
Yeahh Use firefox. Download the latest version of it and then you can get loads of themes and stuff

Minee?
