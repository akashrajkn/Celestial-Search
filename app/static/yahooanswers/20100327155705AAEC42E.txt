Will There.com ever re-open?
There is a cool little website called There.com that let's you interact with people all over the world and dress your avatar and fun things like that (something like Sims but on a website). I hadn't gone on there.com for quite a while but felt like trying it again today, when, unfortunately, it said "closed" when i went to the website. Will there.com ever re-open? or is it closed permanently?

I doubt there.com will ever open back up, Closed permanently,
