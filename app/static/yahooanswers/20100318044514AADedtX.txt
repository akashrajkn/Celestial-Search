How do I permanently get rid of toolbars in my browser?
Ok, well i have had this laptop for about a month now, and I have also downloaded a few programs, which also include toolbars for the internet browser. Every time i realize why my screen is smaller, i remove the toolbar by right clicking on it, and the next time, or next few times after i get rid of it, comes back!

How do i stop them from coming back and consuming my screen space?

Uninstall them. You may have to go to Add/Remove programs to do this. Also check the add-ons section in your browser menus (you don't say what browser...), since there may be a way to get rid of them there.

When you download programs in the future, look for the little check boxes that offer you these stupid things. They are always checked. Uncheck them.
Most of the toolbars comes with uninstaller. You can either go to Control Panel --> Add/Remove Programs to remove the program and you can also check in manage addons and disable those addons
(if you're using Windows)
Go to Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs, 

Find out the toolbars and uninstal them (at this step it's recomended that you have Internet Explorer(assuming this is the program) closed)!
You'll catch a virus in no time.
UNINSTALLED THE TOOLBAR FROM UR BROWSER GOING TO ADD ONS IN UR BROWSER
