False information on Internet Site. Is this an offence?
We were on a site and discovered someone we knew locally. He has put down false information in regards to his past serving career in one of the British Forces. Is this illegal or can anyone falsify things in such a secure Internet site?

YES IT IS OH COURSE NOW GO TO SEEK FOR THERAPY YOU MUST HAVE A BRAIN DAMAGE BY NOW!
People falsify certain information on the Internet to safeguard their actual identities from spammers or people they generally want to avoid, or to gain undue favors by cheating or tricking unsuspecting people etc etc... There might be a whole lot other good or bad reasons to do it ! But strictly technically, i wonder if it would be simply illegal to do what that guy has done...
unless he is under oath there is nothing illegal about it
Of course it's an offense that's why there's almost never false information on the internet.
Not at all .. you are free here but a littlething keep in mimd that your virtual identity should match with anyone .........
That depends on entirely and exactly what he has written. Padding something out or slight exaggeration is not an offence.

If he claims he has won and wears medals or ribbons in public that he is not entitled to wear then that is an offence.

Like that bloke a couple of months ago who claimed he had been in the SAS and wore medals he wasn't entitled to and couldn't possibly have won. He got done for that.

However seeing that we don't know the bloke or haven't seen what he has written then there is no way we could comment on it.

If you feel that strongly about it then make a complaint about it.
