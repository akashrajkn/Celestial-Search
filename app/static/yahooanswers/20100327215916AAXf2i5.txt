liven in Marion, Louisiana working at bayoucable?
It's about 10 miles from Marion, Louisiana to Huttig, Arkansas on hwy 33, their running Dsl along the highway their is a few house along hwy 33 coming from Marion, La into Hutting, Ar and it's about 10 miles I noticed the other day that their was gray looking boxes along the road every few feet going into Huttig, Ar. I was thinking would them gray boxes be something to do about tying the dsl into phone lines.

hey buddy i work at Bayou Cable and yes we are laying down DSL lines into the phones (which would explain all them gray boxes)... all you Marion residents can finally ditch all that dial-up shit and get the fast stuff!  man Louisiana is moving up in the world.  maybe we can get Google fiber in about 20 years :D

glad to help
