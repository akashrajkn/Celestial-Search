How do you actually follow somebody on twitter?
I have just set up an account and I don't know whether i am missing some massive search box, but how do i find and follow a specific person like a celeb without have to follow somebody on the suggestions page?

http://twitter.com/search
you click on there name (or profile button) on the side there is a small raised box with their username and picture and an even smaller button near the bottom that looks like this....

+follow

You click on it and it will say at the top of your screen "you are now following this user"

hope it helps
To follow somebody on twitter you have to visit someone's twitter profile and to click link 'follow' in top left part of his profile (and in order to do this you must be logged into your twitter account with your username and password).

For getting Twitter followers you can also use some of automated Twitter tools for getting hundreds or thousands of Twitter Followers and Customers like this one
