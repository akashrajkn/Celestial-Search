By the way: US has the top level domain .us, .com is commercial and can be used by anyone.
.ca is Canada.
.COM  .ORG and .NET are typicall extensions for US and Canada combined.

Yes, technically the US should be ".US" and canada should be ".CA"  . ..  and yes, ".COM" can be used anywhere in the world. . . . but typically, Canada uses the same as us. Where, other countries use their own "assigned" domain extension.
Hi,

It's a top level domain name.

On the Internet, "com" is one of the top-level domain names that can be used when choosing a domain name. It generally describes the entity owning the domain name as a commercial organization. Along with the second-level domain name (for example: "yahoo" in yahoo.com), the top-level domain name is required in Web and e-mail addresses. 

In Canada it's .ca
