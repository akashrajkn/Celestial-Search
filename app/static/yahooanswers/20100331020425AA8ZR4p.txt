In the next 200 years assuming the internet is still running, if...?
In the next 200 years (assuming the internet still runs) what do you think will happen to domains if most of them will start to become taken up? Is it possible that domain names could become investments?

Certain domain names are already investments.  People buy domain names (like Madonna.com, wallstreetjournal.com etc) in the hope that the companies or people who have that name will buy it off them so they can make a profit.

Some even end up in court. http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/10/16/madonna.cybersquatter.reut/

To answer your question, we won't have domain names in the future.  Everything will be linked and will be done more like a search engine to get to view the information you want.
