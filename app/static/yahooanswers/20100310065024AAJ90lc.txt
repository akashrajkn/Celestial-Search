How long can you survive without mobile or Internet access before you break into cold sweats?

2 minutes.
I've gone months because all I had before was dial up and didn't feel like dealing with that. It's a pain but it's doable.
as long as i want.  the internet service at my old apartment sucked, so i never used the internet.  and i don't have mobile internet.
Put down the crackberry

The symptoms will subside - there is life beyond the net.
