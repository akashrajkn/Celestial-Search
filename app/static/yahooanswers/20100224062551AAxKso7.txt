Why is it someone always beats me to answering first?
It pisses me off, maybe because I take time to check my punctuation and grammatical errors, and I also always write at the end:
Cheers! - Most knowledgeable 12 year old you will ever know.

It is not who falls in the first slot that matters really, it is who gives the most helpful answer.  Don't worry about being the first answer, worry more about giving a good, well informed, helpful answer.
Id leave out the.. cheers! -Most knowledgable 12yr old you will ever know. Great people with great minds don't need to tell everyone else..their actions does that ;)
Ever hear the wise quote which says.. Be better then everyone else..just don't tell them?
I have the same problem because my answers are usually more well thought out and I take the time to give detailed information, spell check my answers, site sources, etc. I think that providing a high quality answer is more important than being the first to post an answer that doesn't offer as much.
Yes you can always look back at quick unprepared answers

when firstly you graduate from school, then also when you hit level 7

Or are number 2 in Aussyland in Psych on Yahoo like me.

Did Einstein think of the theory of relativity in 5 minutes ?

Did Orville & Wilbur Wright learn to fly the first powered flight in one day ?

Did Edison invent the electric light globe in a week ?

Your speed when it comes will be decisive accurate & sharp!

Good on you!
