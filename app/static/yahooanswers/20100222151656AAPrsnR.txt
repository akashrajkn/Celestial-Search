Can I renew a webkinz the day that my account is going to expire?
I haven't gotten a webkinz in a while but I asked for one for my birthday, it also expires on my birthday can i renew it on the day it's going to expire?

add another pet to that account it'll keep it running for another year
Like Redrider469 said, that is right.
you actually have 30 days from the day your account expires to renew it, so you'll be fine!
Yes. Although My sister's account expired like two months ago and it still says she can renew her account. Don't worry
