When Lockerz re-stocks how long until they run out?


Well I think Lockerz is a scam....but when they do restock the prizes last about 30 seconds and then are gone. It is very hard to win anything. 

But just a suggestion is to try swagbucks. Swagbucks is very legit. Ive made over 
$100 in amazon.com gift cards. Its a search engine just like google, but you randomly 
win swagbucks every day for searching and entering swagcodes.
