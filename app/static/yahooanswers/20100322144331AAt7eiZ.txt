Can someone explain what 4chan is?
I mean, I know it's a website where anyone can post comments about different topics for free, and that most of the people on there are anonymous.
But, what is /b/ and what is anon? I'm asking here, because whenever I ask a 4chan website user, they call me a newfag and won't answer so...

also, I'm to afraid to go to the 4chan site because someone might hack me. Is this rational?

It's basically a forum site for adults.
/B/ is a random image board, and anon is short for a group called anonymous. I'm not exactly sure what they are, but I think they are a group that strongly believes in Scientology. Here's their site:

I don't really get on 4chan, but I heard that anonymous is bad news from some x-users.
And I don't really think you should be scared to get on 4chan and be hacked, but the site is really kinda bad. It's filled with trolls and jerks.

I'm sorry if my info wasn't very specific, I just looked that stuff up on google. :/
