Try going on your internet explorer, and click on 
Tools >> Internet Options >> and then somewhere here there shall be a tab saying 'Reset internet options'  - Try that, if it still does not work, take your PC to your local PC shop or where you got it from, and maybe they can help you.
if a system update like that was interupted you could have just trashed your computer. first thing i would try is go to system tools in start menu. i think its under accesories.   and run the system restore. return the computer to an erlier time. then run the sp2 update again without interuptions. this will mot likley fix it. but if this fails you will probly have to reinstall windows compleatly.  but seriously. xp is 10 years old.  its a dinosaur.  its time for an upgrade. i would recomend a mac. i got my first mac about a month ago. i love it.    windows seven is nice too but its still windows under the hood. dll's registry. disk defrag.  same old technology. you dont have to defrag a mac or worry about viruses or any of that mess. its a better way to go.   i promise you. even if you upgrade to windows seven. once you see what its about then go use on xp machine you wil say to yourself. xp? what a pile of junk.  trust me you will. but anywyas back on topic.  run system restore. then run the update again without interupting it. thats you best fix. if that fails you will to reinstall windows.
