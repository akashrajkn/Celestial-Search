Question about a problem I am having with Firefox and formatting text.?
So, I am having this little problem with firefox. Everytime I am on Gaia online, and I have a long post typed up, I try and format it and it skips to the start of the post. For example, if I have a huge paragraph typed up, and I want something to be in bold, I will highlight it, put it in bold, and it will bring me to the start of what I wrote. This is a massive pain, because I often times decorate my posts for my roleplays.

I know it is not Gaia because it does not do this on any other browser, nor does it do this on my friend's firefox browser.

Please help!
yes, it is up to date

Is your version of Firefox up-to-date (3.6.1)? If it isn't, please update it. That's the easiest way to fix problems.
Hmm I tried it and it happens to me too. But I didn't notice 'cuase I type in all my BBCode or I paste it in. 

Try asking in site feedback or the Q&A forum, those people know everything. Or, you can just type in the coding.
