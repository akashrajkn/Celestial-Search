How do you get past website ad blockers?
I took a screen-shot of what I'm talking about. I didn't plan on asking any questions on Yahoo but this pissed me off too much to not ask. Here's the link to the screen-shot: http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt293/zachm1995/ADBLOCKER.jpg

You can't.
Actually it is possible. Save the file to your hard drive, remove the JavaScript code for the blocker thing,change everything to an absolute URL and open the file.
Hm
