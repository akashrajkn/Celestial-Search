Is Points2Shop for real? What is the catch?
I am thinking about joining it but I don't want to join a site that won't work. I also don't have a credit card, because I'm young so can I still do things on there to earn a reasonable amount of points? Would I still be able to buy expensive things like an iPod Touch? Is it worth it?

You don't need a credit card and you can do anything you want on the site, you only have to be 13 to join. And yes they have many ipod touch's always in stock. 

Points2shop is by far the best site for earning free cash/prizes. I've been a member of all the get free stuff websites: Prizerebel, Swagbucks, Lockerz, Rewards1, and cashcrate. They were all really hard to earn points on. It was very time consuming. And I never got anything from those sites.

If I were you I'd go to points2shop. You can earn points so easily on points2shop by completing offers, surveys, playing games, or simply by clicking on links! It¡¯s that easy! I just received an ipod nano from points2shop in the mail last month. You get all your prizes directly off amazon.com, which makes shopping for prizes a lot easier because amazon has every item you could possibly want. 

Points2shop is best, fastest, and easiest site for getting free stuff. Best of all Points2shop is 100% free.If you need to know more information you can check their forums where members post the things that they have received for earning points on the points2shop website below.

The only way to get 250 free bonus points is by going to the link below and signing up.
