What is 4chan and is it any good?
Hi, I'm new(ish) to the internet, and I heard about something called 4chan. What is it, and is it any good?
Really? And can I find a girlfriend there? Y'know, one that hates?

I'd stay away from it if I were you. It's full of free speech, which includes lots of hate speech and shocking images. Normally has pictures of adult content too. It can be humourous, but it's just very strange. It is, however, highly addictive, so I'd recommend not starting it. If you'd just want the funny pictures they make, then some can be found on www.twobluecrabs.com, but again beware of hate speech.
4chan is oft regarded as being the scum of the Internet. It's one of what's called an "image board", that includes many people having conversations based on images. Every conversation begins with an image, and people talk about it. Usually the images are crude or even illegal. It's hard to keep track of who's who, because everyone just called themselves "anonymous". It's separated up into difference categories, each of which is identified by a letter. You should particularly avoid /b/.
