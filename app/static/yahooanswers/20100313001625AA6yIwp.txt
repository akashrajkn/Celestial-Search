Is there a way to take off advertisements?
Like off web pagers? is there a way to block them? not the pop ups, but the ones on the page/site

there is NO way to get rid of them.
Get the browser called Firefox, then get the add-on called AddBlock.

Mozilla.com
YEs, adblock pro with Firefox.
I think you mean the ads that flash across the page. I had the same problem as many do. If you use firefox there's an add on called Adblock plus and you also download the Filter subscription: EasyList (USA) which will kill these intrusive ads plus leave your normal flash usage unaffected.
