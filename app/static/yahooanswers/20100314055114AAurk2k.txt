Why Can't I Go On My Twitter?
When I go to my Twitter account today it said: 'Do you want to view only the webpage content that is secure' or something like that and whether I choose yes or no it will always close the window and say that 'Internet cannot display the webpage'.

What's going on?!

I do believe Twitter is down.  Probs something to do with the Daylight Savings Time, or the Beiber fans broke it.

Edit:  They have a status report up that they are aware of frozen timelines and are fixing it.  I can get on from my Blackberry but not from my laptop.  Weird.
Twitter always does that.
