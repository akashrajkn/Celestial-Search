What is this name of this website?
I'm trying to figure out the name of a games website. I used to go on it a couple of years ago....Basically its a Websites where you can play games like Roulette, Pool, Monopoly etc with other people online. You collected tokens by winning games and you could also create an avatar, there was a chat room by the side of whatever game you was playing too. 

Anybody?

I think you want Pogo.com maybe.  It sounds like it from your description. I play games there and like it.
