Good Websites For Downloading Torrents ?
I already know about isohunt and pirate bay, wondered if there's any more good ones ?

Nope
No, PirateBay is your best bet : ) It's proven the safest, most user friendly, and having the best results
have you tried researching through utorrent ? it always finds great things
hope i helped :)
Minidova & Demonoid
go download.com
Pirate is no longer a safe site.  Unfortunately the site contains banner ads that contain malicious script and will download anti-virus pro (a very bad virus) just by visiting the page.  

You can assume this is just a ploy to scare you away from the site but do your research and you will see this is true.

The change is due to the new ownership that took over recently and have put an add system in place that is not safe.

R.I.P Pirate Bay
