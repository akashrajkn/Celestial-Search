How can i bypass a download restriction?
Hey folks, i'm going to college, and the internet there is a nuissance

it is possible to download regular things such as documents or even games through the normal way in internet explorer e.g. but it is impossible to download torrents ;[

Anyone perhaps knows a way to bypass this and download torrents on my school nonetheless?

Very good reason for this.
Torrent downloads are inevitably illegal - otherwise there would be no need for torrents.
Many ISP's are now monitoring illegal downloads and issuing formal warnings.
Your intended activity would place your college's entire Internet connection at risk of disconnection.
i'm in highschool and the only way to bypass every restriction is to get the administrator code.u can get it from some in the tech lab (if there is one).
