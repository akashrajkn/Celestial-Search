Question for people who use ebay.?
Why, when every single item I've ever sold has been posted within a day of receiving payment, do I not have a full 5 stars on dispatch time??

WHY?!

I couldn't have been any more perfect when it comes to posting items straight away!

The stars are based on buyer feedback.  If your buyers don't provide positive feedback, you don't get the stars.
