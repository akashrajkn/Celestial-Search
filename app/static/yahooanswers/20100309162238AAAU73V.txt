I REALLY Need Help With Twitter! Please help me!!?
Ok, I found my BFF who I haven't seen in like 2 years on twitter. I'm not a fan of twitter so I don't quite know how to navigate through it. I want to post on her wall, asking if she remembers me. Is there anyway I can do this? Or is there anyway I can post this somewhere where she will definitely see it? She is not following me since I don't think she knows I have a twitter. Can someone please help me??? Thanks!
I want to send a message to her where only she will see it. Plus, doesn't she have to be following me for her to see my messages that I posted?

Twitter is really simple.
Okay, so lets just say her username is like... hi1234...
If you want to write to her you could do
@hi1234 message 
get it?
or you can send a direct message (DM)
hope this helped :)
On Twitter, in your update status thing, simply put @username(whatever her username is) and it should show up on her tweets. 

OR you can go to her Twitter page and in the right column of the page see if it says direct message.
