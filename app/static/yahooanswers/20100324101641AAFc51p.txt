Which domain name should I buy?
What sounds better to you? This is just an example: outdoorsportsman.com OR theoutdoorsportsman.com Should I go with or without the "the"

Do not use "the" in the domain name.  Always attempt to use the main keyword in the domain name.
It is better with out the "the".  But you can get both their just $10 at http://www.netinternetdomains.com
