am having trouble linking to webpages from links?
Just of recent, whenever I receive an email with a link or thread (by the way, is this the same thing?!!), I can, in no way link.  If I click on the link I just get an "empty reaction", i.e. the page stays where it is and nothing opens up.  Being as most emails tend to have some kind of link, this is getting to be quite frustrating.  Okay, I know that I can always "copy" and "paste" onto a web page, but this tends to become a little long winded when I have alot of post to deal with.  Can anyone tell me, why this is happening and if possible how to repair this problem.  P.S.  I would be interested to know if the terms "thread" and "link" are the same thing.  My IT jargon isn't that great!!  Thanks

thread usually has to deal with a forum link is just that a link to another website. Its sounds like it is your popup blocker causing problem. Bring the mouse over the pictures in the top of your browser until you find one that says pop-up blocker change the setting to always allow from this webpage.
