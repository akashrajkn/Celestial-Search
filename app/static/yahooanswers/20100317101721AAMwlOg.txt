what does false mean on the martha stewart web page?
i try to get easter egg designs on martha stewart.com but the screen goes blank and says false on it what is that and how can i stop it

Maybe there was a problem with the web server.  But it appears to work fine for me.  Try going to http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/easter-eggs

If you still get "False" then you might have a problem with your PC such as a virus.
