How do I know if this is real? Should I trust it?
So there is a thing on facebook to get a free $250 IKEA gift card. Yes, most of the comments say they actually got the gift card and its real. But when I gave my email, I got a like to another website to get a free prize:

Is this real? Should I trust it?  I know it sounds stupid, but Im just making sure.

It's absolute bs and a scam,
You should use Firefox, with the web of trust add-on. And yes it's a scam. Anything on the internet and email that offers free money, is 99% a scam.

Here is the web of trust rating for that site:

It's all BS! Don't trust anything online.
My McAfee site adviser shows it is not a safe web site.
its not real most of those things damage you're computer and plus a chance to veiw your address in public. Nothing is free in this economy.
My dear, the card is probably real, but what you'll have to do to get it probably isn't worth the trouble. Most of these things promise to give so great gift like a credit card, shopping spree or a new laptop. What you find later is you'll be asked to sign up for a trial offer or make a purchase of some kind before you receive it. Remember, nothing is ever free in life. Don't believe me then go ahead and continue on the site. At some point you'll be asked about your needs for a service. Insurance, movie rentals, etc. To me not worth the time and hassle.

Hope this is helpful. I am speaking from experience. These marketing tools are just that to get you to buy something you probably didn't want to buy just because you want to get something for free.
BS dont trust
