Locker next restock date?
Does anyone know where to check for the next restock date on lockerz?

I found this site: http://lockerzshare.in/giftcountdown/
Do you think it's real?

Thanks
For Lockerz.com

I would say no because it says prediction...but also I don't know because Lockerz is a scam anyway that just sells your email address to stalkers...And if that was right by the time you could reddem something it would be impossible to get because it would be sold out... I have quit using Lockerz.

Just a suggestion, of what I use now is swagbucks. With swagbucks you search and win "Swagbucks" which you can trade in for really cool prizes! I have got $70+ in amazon gift cards in 2 months. You can also enter swagcodes, do offers, watch videos and alot more! If you have anymore questions you can ask on there facebook wall.
If you would like you can sign up here and start with 30 swagbucks!
