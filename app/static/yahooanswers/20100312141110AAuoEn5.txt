How do i use Hotbar to access sites?
I was searching to watch Sortilegio(love spell) online and i came across www.sotrilegiotv.com. However to watch the episodes for free, i was instructed to download the adware Hotbar ,which promises free access to this site.  I managed to download Hotbar, its functioning pretty well but i still cant get access to the above site. Where am a going wrong?

Hotbar is not ok NO NO NO. its bad for your computer they are twirling with you. its adware at its finest and they use to be called zango. they got sued and now they are legally hiding under that name and pinball corp. I would remove right away all they want to do is watch your searching habbits. AND MAKE MONEY in the process slow your computer down and and offer you little to no services for viewing ads
