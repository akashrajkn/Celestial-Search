PLEASE ANSWER! URGENT EBAY QUESTION!!?
I meant to bid 60p on some headphones but i accidentally bid ?60!! it says; "eBay automatically bids on your behalf up to your maximum bid. If the item ends for less than your maximum, that's all you'll have to pay" so does that mean that all I will have to pay is 60p or will i end up having to pay?60? PLEASE answer it ends in 10 minutes!!!!
pdxsdh - THANK YOU SO MUCH. i deleted the bid with 13 secs to go so I am going to give you best answer no matter what other answers people give

E-mail the seller right away and explain.

Or use the Bid Retraction Form:

Don't worry, all it means is that the most you'll pay is ?60
Unless someone finds out and keeps outbidding you upto ?60 then you'll have to pay so don't worry because I doubt anyone will know that :)
No one will go higher than 10 quid on headphones tbh :)
Contact the seller and tell him how much you wanted to bid.
