Can IP Tracer Id Topix Post?
Can a IP Tracer identify an IP address on a post on Topix?  Is there any software available to get an IP address from a Topix post?
Or is the only way to get an IP is through Topix itself?  If you have an IP, can a person use a software/site (subscribtion or otherwise) to gain person information such as name, street address, City, State etc.  This would be an IP address issued from Comcast.  I understand Comcast IP dont id name, street etc...just a general location.  I following a Topix post involving such questions.  Im afraid someone is going to get sued as threats are being made.

no they cant, but still they have some other ways to get posters ips
