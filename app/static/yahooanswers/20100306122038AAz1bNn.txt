when ever i try to go to a certain site i get this what can i do about it?
Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at lu.scous
*   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.
*   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

*   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Sounds like a malware/virus i had. It would not let me open google i got the same message.   after running malewarebytes it went away.
