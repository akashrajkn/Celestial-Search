Any websites that show how you would look with different hairstyles?
are there any sites where you can upload a photo and choose different hairstyles, and see how you look with it(for guys too)?

Yes I was just looking around for a similar program and found a review of 3 websites that offer hairstyles view in a 3D picture. Have a picture of your self available and have fun!

Here is the link:

2 of these websites are totally FREE of charge and 1 is a pay site. 
Personally the FREE sites are much more user friendly and the one has over 3000 hairstyles to choose from!! 
Have FUN and hope you find your style of choice!!
