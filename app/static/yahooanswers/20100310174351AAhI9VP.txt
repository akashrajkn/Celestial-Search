How to report online company selling BOGUS dvds?
I purchased 34dvds + 1CD from company in China. I didnt buy them thru ebay. So pay pal cant help me.. Im so angry as they refuse to answer me. The discs have so many faults ranging from incorrect labeling, quality issues eg no sound. The quality is so bad some are unwatchable. The thing is they are still selling them. What can I do
Im not from the USA. Also its totally legal to order DVDs online. Where are you getting your info????? What about ebay?? They sell zillions of DVDs from all over the world.....
What I wanted was to warn others about this company. I know I just have to wear it...

You count your losses.  What you did is a felony, so unless you want to be charged I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
you just learned a expensive lesson china does not abide by us laws and piracy in rampant there
Since when is buying dvd's form outside the US  a felony? I buy them from other countries all the time on ebay. But as stated before, tally it up as a loss, i don't think there's any laws for offshore companies.
