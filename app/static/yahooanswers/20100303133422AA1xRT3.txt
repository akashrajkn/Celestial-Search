If a picture is named "GetAttachment.jpg", where is this picture saved from ? which site(s) in particular ?

not photobucket :P

It sounds like it was saved without manually naming it, so the original file must have been named that. Unfortunately you cannot figure out the website just from a name.
probably photobucket.com
