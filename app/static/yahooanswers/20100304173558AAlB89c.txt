Someone has filed a paypal claim against me, but I have no proof that I sent the item. What should I do?
I sold a gift card to an ebay user in Canada. I just bought a stamp and stuck it in an envelope. So I have no proof that I ever shipped it out, but I definitely did. I have had no previous problems sending gift card this way, and I concealed the card between two index cards and put it in a security envelope. It must have gotten lost in the mail or the buyer is lying. What can I do?

Suck it up and take the loss.  Learn from this experience and don't ship without some kind of proof in the future!
Tell him if it doesn't arrive in 2 weeks, he can fiel a claim against you. And tell him you did ship it.
Unfortunately there is nothing you can do, paypal will side with the buyer so I would refund them. has the claim been escalated to paypal yet? If not - refund them willingly otherwise Paypal will not only take the amount that the buyer has paid, they will charge you a fee!
Always send items through a trackable/signature delivery without a tracking number you dont stand a chance to win.
As a seller you are responsible to ensure the item reaches the buyer.
