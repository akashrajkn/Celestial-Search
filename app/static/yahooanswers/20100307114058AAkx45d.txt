Where on my computer can I find the following information about the Internet connection I have...?
- The Speed
- Bandwidth Traffic
- Free Online Storage

I'm changing companies for my Internet connection and I want to compare the connection I have and the one I will have...

Thank you!

Online, online, and online.

Your ISP's website would probably be a good place to start.
