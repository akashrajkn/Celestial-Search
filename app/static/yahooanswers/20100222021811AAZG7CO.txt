hai,
      frequently, getting message skype ie plugin error in my IE web-browser.what is the error? and how to remove this error .

firstly i would like to suggest you that IE is worst web browser....use any othr browser like MOZILLA,SAFARI,OPERA,CHROME etc.

but you can solve your Problem by following steps:
open IE
then
press alt key then T then select Internet Option..
then Select Advance
then select REST or RESTORE options.

if nothing works then install plugins from adobe.com
u can also find easily from google search (IE plugins)...

try it!!
