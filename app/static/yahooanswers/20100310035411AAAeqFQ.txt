How can i transfer money from my credit card to my pay pal account?
I am using my dad's credit card (with consent) i don't mind him knowing how much he got charged but i don't want him to know from where it was charged online...SO i want to transfer money from the credit card to pay pal so that all he sees is that it was a pay pal translation....or can you suggest other ways?

You can not transfer money from a credit card to a paypal account.  You can only transfer from a bank account.
