Do you know of any site?
Im a creative writter! I've been writting my own stories since i was ten trying to improve them as i got older! But the only thing is i cant find many people to take time to read them so i was hoping if any one knew of any site that i can post my stories on and chat with the people that read them about what they think about my stories and what i should or shouldnt do to improve them next time. If you have any that you can think of please let me know! thanks and have a great day!

you can write u r stories or articles in many sites some of them is wikipedia and you can also try creating ur own blogspot and start writing there,  HAVE FUN :()
