Need help choosing a blog name/url :]?
So I was planning on opening a blog of basically my life for anyone else to read, so I made some polls to choose the URL and they simply said that guys typically don't like blogs anyways, so I was thinking: hey, why don't I wrote a blog about my life and have it aimed towards girls? Girls could read it and I think that would be sort of cool? So I'm not positive but if you could please give me some url ideas or some nice key words for it that'd be great. 

Some ideas for topics:
Funny Stuff
Entertainment
Q&A
Other

Some url ideas:
LifeInOurEyes.com
have a catchy name in mind?

If you want to attract girls to your blog, you better know about shoes! 
And hair. And gossip. And crappy movies. And feelings. And vampires.

K just kidding lol. But if you're going to invest the effort in doing a blog, you better have some good, interesting content - a lot of it. And fresh stuff every day to get them coming back every day. And a comments section, to get feedback & make them feel like a part of it. And imbedded YouTube vids always helps...if they are good. There's nothing worse than lame YouTube vids.
