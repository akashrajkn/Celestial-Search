By giving me your Social Security number and current IP address.
I think this question is going to get deleted.
First of all, to be clear, a hacker does not have to be a person with bad intentions, but is often a person who finds security breaches to improve something, like a website or a computer program.

You may want to check out hackthissite.org, though, a site where the goal is to finally hack that site.

But hacking is not easy, and you shouldn't do it in any illegal or bad way.
Be curious. You're off to a good start.

Take things apart because you're curious about how they work - not just because I said to. Soon it'll be a burning curiosity every time you get something new, to take it apart and see how and why it works. Then you'll start fixing things, because you know how they _should_ work. Then you'll start modifying things, because you want it to do something you know it can, but doesn't. Then, my friend, you will be a hacker.

Or maybe you mean "cracker". In which case, you can go become an hero.
I think you need to learn grammar and spelling first!
