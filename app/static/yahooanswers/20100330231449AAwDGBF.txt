internet problems thanks?
well when i go to a webpage at times i just get a blank pages. On times i get through and see the web page.

For example when i go to yahoo i can access the web pages and one other occasion i cannot. All i get is a blank page.

I have cleaned the cookies and i have no viruses

any idea what to do?

If you use vista it is called the white screen of death and the easiest fix is to reinstall your o.s
Try refereshig the page first, then turn off comp. turn off modem reboot comp and then turn on modem. 
Whilst this is happening in yahoo can you get other pages.
