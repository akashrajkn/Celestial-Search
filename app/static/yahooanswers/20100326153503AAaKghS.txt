Is there a such thing as an internet decency code?
I was having a conversation with Cleverbot with random words just to see what it would say. When I typed an inappropriate word, Cleverbot said "You are in violation of the new international Internet Decency Code. . . . . We will send an ATF agent to arrest you shortly. " Are they REALLY going to send an ATF agent after me? I laughed this off at first, but I nedd to know... Is this legit?

Not legit.
no it's not real. don't worry.
lol hahaha your name suits you !!
Lol,

no. you're fine. It's a joke.
Cleverbot from what I can tell takes what you type and analyzes the context, and then selects the best appropriate answer from the other users that are currently on it typing things in  OR from its saved history.  If I were to program something like it, that is how I would do it.
