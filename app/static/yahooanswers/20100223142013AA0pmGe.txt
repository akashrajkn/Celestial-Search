On ebay, do you give the refund after an item is returned to you?
sold a ps2 and games on ebay and buyer said that the disc drive was broken so i decided to give a refund but does the buyer have to dispatch it to me and i pay her once i receive my returned item? or do i give her refund before? many thanks.

Never give a refund before you receive the item back
If its faulty, you should fully refund here (including postage) and actually pay for postage to send items back.  Thats in an ideal world. Howver, it the disc drive IS broken, is it worth that? Maybe just refund her the actual price she paid and tell her to not bother sending it.
wait for them to send it back before you refend them otherwice they might just be saying that so you send money back and be lanning on basically gettiny your playstation for free and running
NEVER Refund 1st. Wait till u get it back, and when you do Inspect all the returned goods in detail (even smell it if u have to) to make sure you are not being scammed. Some people will swap your goods for faulty goods acquired else where. When and if you are 100% satified that the goods was yours then consider the refund.
Send the refund once you have received the return.
