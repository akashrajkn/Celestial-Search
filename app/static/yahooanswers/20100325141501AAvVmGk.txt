Multiple-Package order on Ebay?
If I sell a snowboard and bindings they will need to go in different boxes (but will still be a together type; thing... the board comes with bindings). Do I put the same label on each of the two boxes?

No, you will need to ship each box separately.

Weigh each box, print the labels accordingly. 

You will pay for and print two labels.
