What would be my best bet to surviving a raptor attack?
If the dreaded raptor attack happened what would I need to do to survive?

Your best bet would be to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
I recommend you GEAR UP! with a crysis battle suit and probably some frags that stick on to sh*t, and you should see Billy Mays and ask him for some Impact Gel!...for a more realistic approach If that doesn't sound good enough you can always attempt to touch your self at night time ;D good luck mate
Fight back! take some pepper spray along.
Here's some advice:

"If you ever travel in time DON'T step on anything,
because even the slightest change can alter the 
future in ways you can't even imagine."  -Grandpa Simpson
Wear a speedo.
