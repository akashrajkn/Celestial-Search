how do you delete your AOL e-mail account?
i opened one to use AIM on my mac but really don't use it that much and want to delete it....
and i can't find how to do it

anyone help please?...

i have looked all over the place at AOL.co.uk on how to delete account but can't find anything

this is only for a AOL e-mail account 

any help will be great
is there a number or fax number in UK for this??

i got aol.co.uk account and AIM name just to use on my Mac but no longer want it or need it

It's relatively easy to create an e-mail account with AOL, but unfortunately not quite as easy to close. AOL offers e-mail addresses to those with paid AOL accounts, as well as to those who create AOL Instant Messenger screen names. No deactivation link is provided for users of either of these services, which means a cancellation requires a phone call,hope this helps
