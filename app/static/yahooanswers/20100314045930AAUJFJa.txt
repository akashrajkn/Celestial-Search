Which site do I mean? (read description)?
A group of people bought the most horrible pc possible and put in the freezer. Then they start overclocking the computer and try to play games with extremely low specs. Then they keep pushing the limits of the machine until it horribly crashes while playing Half-Life. There was also some vodka in the freezer and it was boiling. I once found this site, but I have lost it now. Anybody know this site?

Maybe this is the site: http://totl.net/Eunuch/Eunuch2.html

Also, this book is a great reference to overclocking: http://bit.ly/aBoeba
