Is there a free web site where I can get information about someone?
Im looking up my friends background... please no dumb answers... thankzzz

Nothing free simply because such a site costs a lot to maintain accurately
What kind of information ?
what sort of information? if you just want a criminal history then in the search box type in whatever county you live in followed by the words "court docket" for instance I live in Winnebago county so I would put winnebago county court dockets and you will usually find a site where you can put in the person's name and their criminal history will be available to look at because it is public domain. Here is the one for my county for example:
http://www.co.winnebago.il.us/jwalk/jwalkframes.html?jvmven=Microsoft+Corp.&jvmver=1.1.4&msjvmver=5.0.3810
You could try this website here, it is prety comprehensive...

And there's LexisNexis, the gold standard of researching facts for law firms, corporations, academic institutions and governments, but it's not free. http://www.lexisnexis.com/
