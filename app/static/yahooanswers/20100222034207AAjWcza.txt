Well, DVD regions are something I'm not sure you understand. Each "region" is a market. There are seven of them: North America, Latin America, Japan, Europe, etc. Manufacturers put regions on DVD's to make it harder for people to ship DVD's from one region to another... so they can sell a DVD cheaper in India and more expensive in Europe or the US. 

The best way to get buyers attention is Buy It Nows (most people don't want to wait a week for an auction to end to save $2 on a DVD) and clever utilization of the title. You get 55 characters on your title. You have to zoom in on things people might be searching for. Like movie's title and big stars in it.
