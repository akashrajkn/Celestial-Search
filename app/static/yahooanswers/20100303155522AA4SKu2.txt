Chatango Hidden Smileys?
I've noticed while using chatango that certain smileys can be used that arn't listed on the smiley page. So far, I've seen *burger* and *poop* <---( yeah that one is weird.) I was wondering if there are anymore? Just curious.

*rolleyes*  
*lol* 
*burger*  
*bored*  
_shhh  
*waves*  
*blush* 
*hb*  
*h*  
zzzz  
*pukes* 
*stop*  
Smileys that can only be used if you've donated to the site:
*dog* 
*panda*  
*monkey*  
*cat* 
*$* 
*soccer*  
*bball*  
_hmmm  
*snow*
