Does the mozilla firefox 'private browsing' setting actually leave no trace in your history?
thanks
4REEE - i don't know enough about computers so i won't try anything like that cause i'll probably end up losing everything
:/

Yes
That's why its called "private browsing", so ofc not
I've never tried it, but you can always "clear recent history".
It will leave a trace, but only file recovery software can gain access to those files.

If you want NO TRACE, then you need an erasure program that will erase the unused space:

And do a 7 pass erasure on the external hard disk of interest. ( Oh heck, you can do 30 passes )

BEWARE!!!!! Once you erase the unused space on that hard disk, nothing on the planet will help you recover those files!!!

So choose what you erase WISELY!!!

It will leave no trace on YOUR computer. It will still leave traces on the websites you visit since Private Browsing doesn't change your IP address
It should leave no trace of cookies etc on your pc. 
However, if you are not the account holder & want to keep it secret from the account holder, then you can't. All calls are logged by your ISP.
It just depends on whether the account holder looks at the history of it from there.
