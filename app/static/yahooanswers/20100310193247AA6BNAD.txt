Is www.onlinedatesafe.com a good website?
A girl I met on the internet said I need to verify my identity, and this site asks for my credit card #. Sounds like a scam, or is this a real way to do background checks for online dating?

google and bing are your friends

Looks like it. If you wanna try dating online i suggest you start at Live Date Search. It has a strong scam detector.
Any site asking you to enter a credit card is a scam that will charge your card and max it out. These are all scams, they just keep changing their name every month or two. There is nothing in a credit card number that can verify your age, identity or criminal background. When 16 year olds can now get credit cards, and it's easy for anyone to use a stolen credit card number, this would be the least safe way of verifying your identity. Any sex offender would be smart enough to use a stolen credit card for verification
This is not a real girl, she is either an escort of a porn spambot. You should never enter your cc  on any site for verification unless you want to lose thousands. If they wanted to verify your identity they would ask for a copy of your passport, birth certificate or other govt issued identification, never a credit card
Here's a new social/dating site that just launched. I like it because it's actually a little different for others. You can actually do a community video chat or private video chat, you can post ads the same as you would do on craig's list, and if you fill out the contact us form at the bottom of the the page and send it off with requesting a free upgrade they will upgrade you for FREE!!!! for 30 days!! WOOT WOOT cant go wrong with free!!!
p.s. Personally I would give out my cc and personal info to a site requesting it...
