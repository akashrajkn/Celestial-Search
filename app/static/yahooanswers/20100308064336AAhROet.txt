Normally, you can check the following settings.
Click on internet option & under connection tab, click on setting after highlighting the connection name.
Click on advanced & uncheck the box which says disconnect when connection may no longer be needed.
Another way is to click on the connection icon in my network connections & click on properties.
Under option tab, put " never" in the box which says idle time before hang up.
I am sure you will find this information of some help to you.
