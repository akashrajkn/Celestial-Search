Very hard to use website, help me?
Hello

On this website.. http://www.ofcom.org.uk/contactus/  it is hard to find where I should go if I want to send an e-mail about not getting marketing texts from Orange.
There are many routes to go through, which have routes with-in them, and routes with-in those routes; some of which return me to this page again.  It means I could be up all night navigating for the correct e-mail address to contact them with.

I would like to know how to either; navigate this site to find the e-mail address I need, or whether there are ways to scan the entire website for it without searching.
I know that if I press 'Ctrl+F' that I can find what I want on this page; but what would I have to do to find what I want on a whole website?
Are there programs that you can download to aid achieving such a task?

What is the best way to go about this?  If people know how to use this site to find the e-mail address, then how do people do this; or how do the people whom make this site expect you to do this?
