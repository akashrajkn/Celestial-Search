What are some good websites for coupons?
stuff that have good coupons please?

I like dealigg
Retailmenot.com I believe is mainly for on-line coupon codes, but it saves tons of money.  I ordered my 2 year old girl a piano from the net and retailmenot saved me 75$, not bad for a site I just googled to find lol
I LOVE http://getpaidtoshopnc.com/
Every time you buy something that you would regularly use, you get money back in your account.  And the number of affiliates - more than Amazon!
I use a few depending on what I'm looking for.  groupon is a cool new concept if you live in one of the cities where they have coupons.  Its a great way to save money but you have to like what they are selling as well.  I got a tandem skydiving jump that was normally $250 for $125!  What a bargain.  For regular everyday purchases at retailers, I like to find things at Coupon Mole.  Easy to search and well organized.
Visit DealBandy.com (http://www.dealbandy.com) for coupons and deals for thousands of online stores. If you can't find what you're looking for, REQUEST A COUPON OR DEAL and have someone else find you one - free!
Retail me not is a great place, I found a great Talenthunter.com coupon there.  I used it and it works if you want the talenthunter.com coupon go here:

If you need the software of lowest price but high quality, Softcns.com is a best coupon website to go. I recommend that site, coz you can be offered much specials. In this way, we can fat our wallet and save up to 50%-75% off. Such as Xilisoft DVD Ripper Ultimate, recently I got, make me a 40% discount. So what I want to say is to share a great discount and coupon code website. 

If need some software or have some interesting about it, pls go into it to have a surfing. So enjoy it & have a fun!

Oh, here is the address, http://www.softcns.com
there are many sites out there but i like http://www.freecouponsshop.com/ , which has lots of new coupons and coupon codes
I only use http://www.couponpunk.com
There are many coupon sites available that offer coupon codes and saving for variety of stores.
