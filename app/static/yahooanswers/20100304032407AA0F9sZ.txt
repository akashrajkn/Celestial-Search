Accessing Youtube with the Firefox browser Question?
Hi.....
I normally use Firefox and normally have no problem accessing Youtube. However, for the first time, today, I have got this pop-up screen:
"Opening watch", 
file watch:

?which is a : application/octet-stream
?from: http://www.youtube.com

It asks: What should Firefox do with this file?
Open with
Save File

I have never had this problem before!! 
Can anyone explain this and how to fix this situation. 
Thank you. 
Salaams.
Thanks Bill :)
