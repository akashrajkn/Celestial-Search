The Fingertips Safe House?
My daughter wants to make the Safe House on fingertips. She asked for my help, but I am not quite sure what to do. I have copied the template of the box on strong card, I have fit the bottle lid in, but I dont get the part after you score the lines. I dont know this:
?   To make the locking device, put the bottle lid through the hole in the door and stick it to the cardboard box behind. 
Can you please help me? Here is the website..

Seems the strong card the hole for the bottle cap is in is in FRONT of the cardboard, so it goes through the hole in the door from the front. The cardboard in back has no hole, and will have the bottle lid stuck to it. So, cardboard box in back, door in front against the cardboard box, bottle lid through the hole, onto the cardboard box, which is in contact with the other side of the door, but has no hole. That's the real deal, it seems.
