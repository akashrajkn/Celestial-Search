Trouble downloading on Firefox?
When I download something on Firefox, it begins to download, but after it completes, it is no longer in the little "Downloads box" that pops up on the screen (the one with a "clear list" option on the bottom less).

Where, then do I manually find the program I'm trying to download to complete the installation?  It's an updated anti-spyware program.

Locate the file:
Tools> Options> General tab: Downloads section.  
Tick the "browse" button, look through the folder index; your current location of downloaded files will be highlighted.
in option select show download when done,u can also check from tools and also pres ctrl and j.
