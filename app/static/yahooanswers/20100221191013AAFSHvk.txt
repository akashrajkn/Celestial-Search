What should I do? Ebay question need help?
Hey I bought something for my dad for his birthday on ebay. I talked to the seller and planned on paying with a money order. It has been over a week since I won the item and I have sent him several emails and have not received a response. His birthday is approaching and I'm not sure what to do. Is there a certain period in which the seller must give you the info to pay? I'm thinking of ordering one from someone else but what would happen with the one I already ordered? Could it be canceled or something since he never contacted me? I am also beginning to wonder if it would even be safe to send him a money order since he has not even responded to me yet. What do you suggest I do?
I haven't gotten his information from him and haven't sent the money order since I don't know where to send it.
We agreed before I bid that I could pay with a money order and now he is not responding to my emails telling me where to send it. Isn't there a certain time period that he has to tell me were to send it?
I don't have a paypal account and it won't give me his address when I click "pay now"
Also I know that he is active because he keeps adding items and yet he still doesn't respond to my emails

sign in to your ebay account then go to the item you won in the left hand side and click view details then you should see contact the seller click it and send him a message that way, if you still get no response from him contact ebay and have it canceled.
