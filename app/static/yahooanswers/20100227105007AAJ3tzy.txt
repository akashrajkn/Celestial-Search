what the hells wrong with the website lockerz.com?
it wont let me log in ive just joined and lots of people have problems with it why?

im having problems wit it too so annoying.it lets me log in but it freezes too MUCH!

don't believe Eret its trying to tell you join the website so he can get points that's how people get points on there ,everytime someone joins using your invite they get points and its very annoying website you have to fill out offers that cost money..its so annoying

waste of time
make anew account to get a invite email to sam.rahman@live.co.uk he will give you a invite just tell your email.only way it happened to me aswell but it dose not happen any more.
