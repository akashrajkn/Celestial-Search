I can't make a formspring account?
I've tried three times now, and it says there's an error, or that my password doesn't match, or that my username doesn't exist? :/

Formspring is always having problems, it's a developing site. Try again in a bit.
But for your passwords not matching, try typing a bit slower. That's just saying that you most likely made a typo in one of them. ^-^ ?
omg that happened to me. I keep trying to change my profile photo and it says "passwords do not match" even though i didnt type in any password!!!! ='(
