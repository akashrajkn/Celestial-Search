Lockerz prize redemption?
Me and my brother each have our own Lockerz account. If we were to get alot of PTZ and get a prize, can we send it to the same house? Basicly, are we allowed to have more than one account per household?
PLEASE TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND OUT YOUR ANSWER.

I wouldn't worry about that because Lockerz is a scam!
The people who run Lockerz have avoided prison by not promising any particular prize to anyone.

The "waves" of prize lotteries grant someone the extremely rare prize that everyone wants, and everyone else gets nothing, or has to settle for wallpaper or donating to charity.

It's like the McDonalds Monopoly game where there is only one rare piece to win the grand prize. Everone else just gets small fries.

Don't waste your time there.
They do have a prize redemption about once a month. It lasts for about 30min. Lockez does not announce when itll be. So there is a very slim chance of winning a prize. If you look on there facebook wall itll have comments on it. And yeah they don't really have a way of telling if youve got two accounts as long as there two different emails.

Just a suggestion but you should look into Swagbucks. Much better then Lockerz. Prizes are always available. If you chose to sign up please use my referral link. http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee
