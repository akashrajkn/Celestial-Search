Whats happens if you won something on Ebay but didn't claim it?
Like I bidded on something and didn't think I was actually going to win it so I just forgot about it, but I ended up winning that bid and I don't want the prize or object I bidded for. What happens if you won that bid but didn't claim it.
are you serious.. great my stupid self bidded on something i dont even want.. now i dont know wat to do.

The seller tries to contact you. If you do not send the money for the item you bid on, then that seller can open up an eBay dispute. Pretty much, if you don't pay for it, that seller and eBay will find a way to send the seller money or you might get your account terminated. I suggest you bid wisley from now on.
Why dont you contact the seller & ask to withdraw from the sale? They are not obligated to do so. They will file a dispute with ebay & will issue you with a non payment strike. It costs money & valuable time to list on ebay.
It never ceases to amaze me why people bid on stuff they dont want,
