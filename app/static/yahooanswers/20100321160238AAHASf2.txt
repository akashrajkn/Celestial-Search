I have the XP Internet Security 2010 virus.. how can I get rid of it?
I've searched this on google and most websites tell me to download Malwarebytes and it'll get rid of it. I already have that installed on my computer, but I can't get that to open!

I have had viruses like this before and I just had to restart my computer and open Malwarebytes before anything else, but I can't get it to open this time. And I've tried many times, even on safe mode. Doesn't work :(

Help please!
