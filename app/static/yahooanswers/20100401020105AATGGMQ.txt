What can I do about this imageshack problem?
I uploaded a few images on imageshack when I had no account so I could not delete them. I want to delete them now and you can do that when you have an account. Is there any way I can claim the images I uploaded when I had no account, as mine?

Thanks

They will be automatically deleted if nobody accesses it for a year. Says so in the FAQ.
