I am looking for a new internet provider similar to Cricket, with no contract & no Credit Check.  Any advice?
I currently have Cricket Internet 3G as my Provider.  I am not happy with the Customer Service with receive when we have a problem.  I would like to find a similar company to switch to.  I am looking for a service with no contract & no credit check.  I do not have a home phone line.  Any ideas?
Thank you Ryan.  I drive from another county to pay my Cricket phone & internet when I have a problem.  I can never seem to get help over the phone so I end up driving.  The reps in store have been the worst Customer service reps I have ever seen, in any business.  The only reason I have stayed is because I do like the internet service itself.  I can get a phone anywhere.  I have often been told 1 thing by 1 rep & then the very next visit been told something completely different.  I have been over charged & refused a refund, I have bought insurance on my broadband card & then when it broke, was told I didn't have it.  Luckily, my Dad gave me an old card to use.  When this one breaks, I will have to go else where.  My phone has been converted to a Cricket because I really loved my phone & didn't want to purchase another.  Now, it gives me problems with texting more often than not.  Sorry to sound bitchy, it just seems I always dread having to deal with these reps.  Thanks for offering!

with 3g will be rough.  Metropcs has no contract and internet, but i dont think that they do 3g
