Does Paypal make me pay right away when I send money?
I want to pay someone over Paypal. Does Paypal work like a credit card with a monthly statement? Do I pay in full or partial? Do I have to have the money in the account before or can I stick it in later?

they make you pay right away
When you pay from a paypal account it will draw the money from whatever you have in your paypal account. If you do not have the money in your account then paypal will need a credit card or your bank account info and it will draw from there. Paypal doesnt offer a line of credit unless you apply and get approved, So without the credit, it needs money right away from you. And lets say you choose to have paypal draw from a bank account to pay for a purchase, the merchant will not receive the payment until the money has cleared your bank.
PayPal charges the entire amount to your card.  However, I noticed the other day, they are offering monthly payments, but you have to apply for the credit!
