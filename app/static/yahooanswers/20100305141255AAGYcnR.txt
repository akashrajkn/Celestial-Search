>>>>Whats with me being online????????<<<<?
Its like, i actually don't find going online fun as it used to be cos theres nothing to do, but when i'm watching tv for example, as when my sister uses the computer, i can't use it when i want, no matter how exciting the film i'm watching, when my sisters off the computer, my mind keeps thinking, go online now! lol, its weird

Is it? I quite often have the television on in the background when I'm on line.

If something interesting comes on then I'll watch that instead.

However seeing as I live on my own I don't have to share either!
Its called addiction
