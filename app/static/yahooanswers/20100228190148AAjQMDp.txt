Do you have to have bank account to do Paid Surveys online?
I don't have a bank account so i can't use Pay Pal.

What sites pay by check by mailing it to you're house.

I wouldn't trust a 'paid survey'.
The checks are usually from the Bank of America..so you need a bank account to cash those. Just open up a small checking account of $50.
Please, don't fall for the scam. You won't make anywhere near what they promise. It's an absolute waste of time. Please ignore posts like those of "worker". Just one of many who post spam here and help perpetuate the lies about how much money is made doing such "surveys".
Mindfield Online pays by check and also by paypal. Survey Head and Opinion Outpost give you the option of check or paypal too
Don't waste your time with paid surveys.
