Legible......I'll take it that you mean legitimate. If you want a browser, go for Opera
chrome:
http://www.google.com/chrome
firefox:
firefox.com
internet explorer:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx

download firefox. it never fails me
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer
http://www.google.com/chrome
http://www.firefox.com <- It's Mozilla Firefox btw, it's one browser

Chrome is the fastest of the three and by far the most secure, but I happen to like Firefox's UI better. I.E. 8 is better than the older versions (like I.E. 6 which is preinstalled on Windows XP), but it's still lacking in the standards support, it's got more security holes than Chrome and Firefox, and it's about 1/10th of Chrome's speed when it comes to Javascript-heavy sites like Yahoo Mail.
Fire Fox is by far the best and I use it always for ease and stability.

google chrome is by far the fastest and most reliable,mozilla firefox is not to bad,but internet explorer which is part of windows itself has a lot of problems. those are the three main ones. so yes of course my recommendation is google chrome
