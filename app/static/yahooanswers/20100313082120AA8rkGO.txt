Are there any more sites like these?
I go on Picnik.com but sometimes it doesn't work for me. Are there anymore of these kind of sites? 

PS- Picnik.com is a website where you can edit your photos and put like doodles and words on it too

Thanks!!!

Picnik, FotoFlexer or Lunapic are great all round web based and FREE editing tools. Adobe, makers of the expensive Photoshop, now has a free website version in Photoshop Express.  If you need/want more features downloading GIMP is a great options.  Still free, but you have to download the software. There are also free tools to add text blurbs, to make collages, to put your photo into other images. There are a number of tools that allow you to put the image of a face into other photos for some fun creations.  Check out the links below for more ideas.
