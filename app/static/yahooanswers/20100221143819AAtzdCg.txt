Why is it that when you type sky news in google, the first link never works!!?
The very first link to the homepage says..Content Encoding Error
The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression.
But the second link in google to sky news works..but takes you to the UK page, not the home page.

Not sure what you mean.  Sky is a UK company.  I just told you the first link works fine for me
