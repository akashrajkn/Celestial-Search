website where you type in a word and see if it is in the book you are reading?
I have vocab words every week for English and if you find the word in something that you are reading and you bring it in you can get extra credit. I was wondering if there is a website were you can type in a book and then a word (vocab word) and see if it is in the book somewhere. 

Example just say my word was, "vacancy" and i was reading the book, "Dear God its me Margret" could i type in dear god its me margret (on the so-called website) and then type in vacancy and see if the word is in that book?? 

Please help, Thanks!!

Sorry, but I doubt anyone has indexed all the books in the world (or even a decent subset of them) so people can locate specific words in them.
