How can I find a video if I have one frame from it?
I have one frame from a video and I need to find the source. Is there a video search engine that I can upload the frame to and get videos that contain this frame?
Since it's a scientific film of bacteria shot through a microscope (not a popular film)

put the frame online, then put the link up on here. lots of people from all over use this site. someone is bound to recognize it and send you the name/movie.
