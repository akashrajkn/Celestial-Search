Can you help me with my webshow?
My friend and I are starting a webshow, and we need some fun ideas. If you give us a really good idea, in our first episode, we will mention you as a sponsor! Our show is called "Severe Fun". So, we are going to need some crazy ideas. All ideas will be helpful. Thanks so much!

Or...see how many times you can hit each other with a pie while pogo sticking!!!
