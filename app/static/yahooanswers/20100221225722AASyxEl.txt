online support groups for kids with deployed parents?
does anyone know of any online support groups for kids with deployed parents? this is the fifth time my dad is gone, but this time for some reason is already so hard.
thank you very much. He should be back in five months, I just feel so alone. He is missing so many things like my first prom.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any, but I would like to thank him for his service and I hope he comes home soon. God Bless America and the Troops that fight for her!
