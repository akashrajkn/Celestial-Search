What does this mean in Twitter?
I know this : ' @ ' is to mention someone for a reply...but what does this means : # ]
like ppl tweets like this (for example): It takes charlie to tango. #modernproverbs
, #raiseyourhandif u r not there ;D,

 what does this # sign means ?
but these tags...where do they come from there are no users of that # names ?

Click on anything that has the # before it - it's called a hash tag.  By clicking on one of those tagged keywords, it will show every other post on Twitter that has the same tag included.
Its also called hashtags, when you include "#" in your tweet it becomes a keyword, now anyone who searches this word all the tweets will be listed which have that word with a #

Its a way of improved tagging, grouping in twitter
