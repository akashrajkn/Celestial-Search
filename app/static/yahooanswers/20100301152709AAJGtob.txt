Lockerz : Redeeming Question?
When I would like to purchase something( and I have enough points), say an ipod, and it is in stock, is it guaranteed that I will get it or is it just a chance thing?

Its totally random.  Their redemption lasts one minute and you never have a clue when itll be... People claim they have won. But you have a very slim chance. 

Just a suggestion is to try swagbucks. Their prizes are always in stock and you can get gift cards. Ive made over $75 in amazon.com gift cards. Its just like google, but you win randomly when searching the web. Try it out-    http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee
