How come when you watch a video on MegaVideo (see details please)?
.. and you aren't a registered member after you watch 72 minutes it will say "You have watched 72 minutes of video today, Please wait 54 minutes or click here to enjoy unlimited use of MegaVideo"

Why does it stop after 72 minutes? It always does that? Is there a particular reason for that amount of time? Why not 60 or 90 minutes?

And waiting 54 minutes?? Not 50 or 55 but 54?

It's to piss you off so that you'll buy their unlimited service.  72 minutes is generally enough to watch 70% of a movie.  The one hour break in between is to further inconvenience you.
Because, you have to pay for the premium service to watch unlimited videos/movies.
It's a way to make money and keep there service up.
I know man it sucks rooster cock >=/
