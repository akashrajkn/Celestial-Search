Can we print Deviantart Pics?
What I mean by that is, dragging the pic from the Deviantart webpage to my desktop page, clicking on it, & printing it from a printer. Can we do that, or do we have to pay?

As long as the image isn't a privately licensed copy then your free to pretty much do what you want with them, this does depend on whether the author deems it appropriate to modify content without permission.

This comes under the Creative Commons Share & Contribution license.

Just check in each DA image, you'll usually see a little notification in the authors commonts stating the license or the policy on the image, maybe referring to a print or copyright work.
