How can you get a free website and domain name?
I use www.webs.com it's pretty good but I hate that you have to make it like "www.blahblahblah.webs.blah how can you get a domain name with a free program like webs that is fun and free?

Unfortunately you cannot get a completely free domain name and website.

I personally got my domain name through http://www.hostingcouponoffer.com they register your www.blahblah.com free for life (in your name).

come with a fantastic website wizard, 24hr support and at $4.84 it's as near to free as you'll get.

Hope it helps, Lee
You can get the cheap web hosting and domain name here http://www.thewebpole.com/  It provides hosting,domain name register, domain appraisal, online file folder, ssl certificate etc...
Freeservers like Webs can only offer subdomains because they are no costs attached to them. Domain names do have fees associated with them so they can't be given away in mass quantities.
