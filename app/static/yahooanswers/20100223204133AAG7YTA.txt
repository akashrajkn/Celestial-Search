How to get points on lockerz?
On the faq on the site it said that there are 15+ ways to get points but i only know 4.
.If you do the daily
.when you sign in for the first time that day
. if you watch videos
. and if you refer people

does anyone know some other ways to get points on the site?

also don't say it's a scam cause it's not.

the 15 ways to get points is when the whole site is well better this year meanwhile just get the z- list and get points for now
