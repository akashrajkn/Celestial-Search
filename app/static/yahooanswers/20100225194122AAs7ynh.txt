Can Avatars be stolen and used by impersonators?
I would think the answer is 'no.'  (Although, I realize someone can create an almost exact avatar to your own.)  That is NOT what I am asking.  I mean can my actual one be used by someone else (from a technical standpoint)?
Philebob...UNTRUE!  Yahoo has a message that returns saying, "This Yahoo ID is unavailable."

They can.  On the screen an avatar is just a graphic, and can be saved and uploaded to another account just like any other graphic.

Worse, on Yahoo! Answers at least, there's no way to prevent another user from using the exact same name you are and really impersonating you.

Sorry.
yes it is very easy, just right click on the avatar and click "save image as"
too easy my pal
yeah
