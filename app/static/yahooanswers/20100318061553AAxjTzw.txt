Laptop or Desktop, get IT from LAPPYZ
yes, i remember using this on my old pc and its really good! :)
i don't know much about it as im not a computer genius but it sure worked
before that try avast antivirus, its really good, i had a virus in my laptop nothing did good but avast has cleaned all the viruses in the machine, try it then if you don't like it go for others, coz its for free, good luck bye
Yes this is best antivirus. But it is heavy on system resources. 
You may choose Norton2010 over this which is quite lite and also work very good.
And yes don't use avast. this doesn't detect many viruses.
Definitely dear...
