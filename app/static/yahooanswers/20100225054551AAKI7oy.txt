Hi 

Try by installing the flash player manual  it will works....

Ur anti-virus is blocking it.Try changing ur settings it will work or else change ur anti-virus.
hi

not only a browser is enough to play a video.u need to play a video are 1. flash player, 2. plug in(suitable for that video)3. shock way installer, 4. java runtime ( some videos run under java environment) etc 
so just download the above and install then try.
mostly if a video wants to play just download the require plugin that shows by the browsers in the page.
