how to send money online without seeing your address and full name?
is there a way you can send money to a person without letting him see my name and address?
it's just for privacy reasons

with xoom you setup an account (with any 'screen name') the recipient of funds only see's the screen name and not the specific account details.
PayPal is a good way to send or receive money. You can setup multiple bank accounts to ur paypal setup and buy or transfer funds to other bank accounts w/ out showing personal info.

I wouldnt trust any other online site to handle transactions because paypal at least refunds your money.
