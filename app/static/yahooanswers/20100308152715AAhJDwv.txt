I have a few questions about twitter?
1) if i see that, for instance, Selena Gomez has tweeted and i want to reply to her tweet. ( so i would hover over her post and at the bottom right hand corner it says re tweet or reply).  so i @reply her would she get it.
2) how come when i reply to celebrities it shows up on my home page as a new tweet.
3)do celebrities reply to you
4)how to get followers (I'm brand new and have no followers but am currently following 15 celebrities)
5)how to video chat or regular chat with celebrities

thank you very much

lol idk if celebrties reply to you. Sometimes they do but rarely.. and whats your twitter? I'll be happy to follow you
1. She would get it, but she probably wouldn't read it. She gets thousands of replies every second.
2. You just tweeted it. You're technically following yourself.
3. It depends.
4. Go live on stickam, get naked, and tell people to follow you.
5. Become friends with them.
