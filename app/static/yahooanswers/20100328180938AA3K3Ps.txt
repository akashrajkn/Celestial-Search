What to do?.......................?
I collect cards for a hobby and with my new computer this new virus protection system tells me if a site is verified,(Green),Caution (yellow), and Risk (red) well one of the sites I go to also has the red (risk) when I got to it. Should I stop going to it or what?

it may be the sites certificate is expired
yes
