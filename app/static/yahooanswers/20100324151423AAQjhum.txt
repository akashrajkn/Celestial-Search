lockerz new prize cost is ridiculous who agrees?
i was going to reedem a laptop for 1500 points but now they tripled the cost without adding new videos or other ways to obtain the prizes, it went from 1500 to 6000 now im never going to get that. if you need to be invited leave me your email adress i need all the points i can get. so tell me what you think and if this will change or something.

They have told everyone since the site started that the prices will be raised early 2010
Lockerz is, sadly, a scam using the natural desire to get something for nothing.

The business model they claim to hold is completely unsustainable, because unless they're making a huge amount of money somewhere along the line, there's no way they can send out the invitingly high-end game consoles in the Lockerz Store... for free, to anyone who happens to have between 250 and 500 points. The mechanics just don't work.

Consider giving out expensive electronics from your porch to everyone who puts a slip of paper on your doorstep. Would that work for very long? Neither would Lockerz.
i was gonna get the xbox, but no it went to like 2000.stupid
I agree with you!
I now moved to http://myhotprize.com and I hope they won't follow lockerz...
I agree. Even though they will put more ways to get points, it's still way to much
