I am looking at the usb internet through tmobile but?
How much is 200 mb a month? or 5gb? I am on the internet everyday...facebook, youtube, limewire, etc....would this be enough for me

5GB would probably not be enough for you each month especially if you watch youtube videos  and use Limewrie to download ...Mobile broadband is ok if you are just surfing but downloading or watching videos take up a load of your allowance ..Besides mobile broadband is quite slow , so it would probably take forever to download using Limewire .

Mobile internet is an expensive way to get the internet cause if you go over your download limit every month they really do charge you for it 

Use this calculator to find out what you can do with 5GB a month ( this is just a rough guide)
