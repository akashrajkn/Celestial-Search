what is it I need to know about points?
I had answered some questions and it says that I need 127 points to get to level two. I got 127 yesterday and I am still on level one. I logged on today and got four points so I have 131 points but it said today that I had to get 119 points to get to level two, does a couple of days before it says level two and has this happened to you and now I have 126 points, help?

you need 124 MORE points, so add that to your current pointage

You need a total of 250 points to get to level 2
