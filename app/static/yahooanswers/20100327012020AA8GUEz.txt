Which wireless broadband device should I buy? Helpppp. . . !?
Please suggest me a service which charges not more than Rs. 500 & allows unlimited downloading.
Rs. 500/month

sorry there are no wireless broadband services that offers unlimited downloads for a price below 500,

but you can try airtel for a good value for money option,

My suggestion : everybody claims Tata Photon is best,    yes i admit it, but it is too pricey,  but don't take this if you're concerned bout the rent.. 

Go for Airtel, you could contact your nearest airtel office to get the service
tata photon+ is the best one
There is no unlimited wireless broadband connection which costs Rs.500.The minimum amount is Rs.750.My sister uses the same plan.The plan is of B.S.N.L. broadband.So Good Luck
