Lockerz invite prob!?
hey yall like many people ive got the new lockerz obsession XD but after 80 invites ive run into a prob, every time i paste an email into the invite box and click send nothing happens! the button just stays gray and it never says sent! and it never sends it! i dont think the site is working on anything and i HIGHLY doubt we are limited to only 80 invites, has anyone els had this prob?
THANKS!

i just sent a couple of invites a few hours ago and they sent. It probably is limited. Sorry if I didn't help that was all i could come up with.
