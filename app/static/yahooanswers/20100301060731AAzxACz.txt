Mozilla Firefox: When it crashed, used to recover my tabs - now it doesn't.  Is this a setting somewhere?
Drives me nuts.  Love Firefox, but it seems to be crashing more lately, and this losing of tabs is driving me crazy.  Help?

disable you add-ons , download newest version and then reset  to default.  should get you back to normal
Go to Tools (Edit for Linux)> Options (Preferences)> Main> top drop menu, tick "Show my windows and tabs from last time"> OK out.
give up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer without opening any windows something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible
stop using Firefox
Install Apple Safari,it rules!! It's much faster than Firefox.
P.S don't use Chrome,its all hype and it lacks security!!
I'm a browser expert,so you can count on me :)
Use Safari
