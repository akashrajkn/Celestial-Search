Another Paypal/Bank Account Question?
Ok, so if I have $30 directly in my paypal account and I wanted to buy something from eBay that is $34.99 but the rest of my money resides in my Chase online bank account, will the eBay system first drain the $30 from my paypal account and then take the $4.99 out of my Chase online bank account to pay for the rest? I mean before I got a refund for an item on eBay, I actually never put any money into my paypal account, it always just took the money directly from my Chase online account and it was very easy. I just don't want any problems that's all.

Paypal always takes a remaining balance first to pay for your items. So yes, you will pay the $30 from your Paypal account and the balance of $4.99 from either your bank account or credit card, however you have it set up.
When you checkout it will tell you exactly where the funds are coming from, and let you change that. The PayPal balance is always used first so y ou can pick where the $4.99 comes from
