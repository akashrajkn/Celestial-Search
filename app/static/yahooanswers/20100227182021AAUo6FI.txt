What are the best e-card sites?
I am looking for some that have nice (funny or interesting) birthday e-cards, and which do not generate spam.

My sister likes Blue Mountain greetings, a friend uses eeek-mail (it's all mice cards, and very cute) and I like Birthday Alarm.  I don't know the address for the eeek-mail one or Blue Mountain, but you can probably find them easily enough through your favorite search engine.  www.birthdayalarm.com is the one I use so I know that address.
