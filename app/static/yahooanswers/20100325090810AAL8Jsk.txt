Can I take the internet with me?
My dad just got u-verse tv for us from AT&T and the DSL internet. Pretty soon i am planning on moving in to an apartment with my boyfriend and i wanted to know if i can move the computer WITH the internet to our apartment, but it still be on my dads bill ( which is the package of dsl and uverse).??
Thank you guys!

no.
unless its like a wireless broadcast from AT&T but if its coming from a cable in the wall. no.
No way, No how...
You can not do this unless your dad adds a second service at the apartment.

Your email account will still be there regardless, but the internet connection to access it will not be.

Check with apartment manager and see if they offer internet access as part of the apartment rental fees.
Only if you have a laptop and you either have to have a portable internet connection or be at a WIFI spot.
