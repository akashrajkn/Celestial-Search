please tell me step by step what I have to do, because I don't know veru much about computers. Thanks

You can check under tools options connections lan settings in Internet explorer.  Make sure automatic settings is check on and everything else should be off, unless you are behind a proxy server.

You can also press the windows key and r and then type cmd and hit enter. you will get a command prompt and type ping yahoo.com and hit enter.  if you get a reply your dns is working correctly.
