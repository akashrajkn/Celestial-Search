You should email them and explain your concern. And well maybe have not posted this on Yahoo Answers and had a friend help you out.
Hey you just try with any mobile broadband service. You ca just login by using that. 
You can ask your sister or Dad to provide you from there friends atleast  if they cant provide you.
You stop doing stupid "competitions" and stop posting the same thing every 15 minutes.
