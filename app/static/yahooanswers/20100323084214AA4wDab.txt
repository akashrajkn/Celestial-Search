Craigslist "it's not ok..." question?
I'm looking at apartment listings, preparing for a July 1 move.  In the city I'm searching, there are very few Craigslist listings for July 1, but many for June 1 and earlier.  I thought it would be potentially helpful for me to contact some of the people/organizations listing properties for rent, to see if they know if they will have any July openings, but I'm worried about violating the "it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests" statement at the bottom of nearly every page.  

Would my request qualify as "other commercial interests?"  

Thanks!

If you're trying to sell things over the phone, don't call.
If you're calling just to advertise business, don't call.

If your call actually pertains to the ad, then call.
No it would not.

Contact away!
if they put there number its fair game
Craig's list is a very dangerous place to shop for apartment listings! More than one person has had their identity stolen from filling out an application!
No, you would be contacting them to potentially give them business. The do not contact would be if you were soliciting them for your own commercial interests.
