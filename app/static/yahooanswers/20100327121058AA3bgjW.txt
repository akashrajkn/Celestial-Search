i want to watch pure pwnage but i dont live in Canada?
I've tried a proxy server but all the ones i use even when i enable scripts it still says they are disabled

Use a personal VPN, http://www.surfbouncer.com they have Canadian servers and IP addresses. Video works over the VPN. I use it for Hulu, BBC iPlayer and CCTV from outside all of the respective countries they are in.
Here's a free proxy created today:

-download up to 50 MB
-hide you IP and stay anonymous
-Fast and hosted on a dedicated server

I get new proxies here everyday:
