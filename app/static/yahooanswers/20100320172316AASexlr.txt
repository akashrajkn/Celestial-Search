Does this website work for you?
It's not working for me right now and I want to know if it is just the website... 
here is the url:

It's just a simple yes or no question! all you have to do is copy the address, put it in the bar and write "yes" or "no". Easy points!

Nope.
no
Actually the games arent down. 4 hours ago some players got dc and couldnt relog (the ones that got dc, relogged or anything else) because the launcher is down. The launcher and the website are down and thats why you cant log in. 2 hours ago they were fine again and some players logged in and in 5 mins they fell down again, i was gonna do pvp kq but i got dc 10 mins ago and now i cant log in either cuz the launcher isnt working but the servers are fine.
