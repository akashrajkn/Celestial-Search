Does anyone know what coat Shutterfly's Splint gives your horse on Howrse?
Hey!

The question is pretty self explanatory for people who will know the answer.  I'm just curious because I don't want to buy it and it to be a coat I don't like.

If you could please describe it, or send a link for a picture please?  That would be great!  Thanks! : )
