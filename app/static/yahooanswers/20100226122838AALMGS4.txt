Is swavi.org really bad... It seems  kinda good to me?
So I like the content of swavi.org but some people are saying it's a hack site or whatever.. I don't know much about computers so can someone tell me plz?

Only a Perverted hoar would like swavi's content.  Swavi is stealing youtube accounts and making em porn advertisers.
It's basically porn that hacks your account on Youtube and spams videos and links to itself. I don't know if it does anything for other sites, but be careful opening a shortened URL.
Srsly its a hack site when they hack it they will post porn on it to spdead the message about swavi.org
but people try to make vids stopping that so yeh 0% trust swavi 100% trust yt
Swavi.org is indeed a hack site. Its a site that is trying to steal your youtube account by you having to enter your user name and password. A hacker send you emails to a tinyurl site that goes to swavi,org. When the hacker has your account, they spam your account and upload porn videos. Whatever you do, do not go to that website.

Also, If you need more information about this hack site, just watch this video made by JeepersMedia:
