Is gozilla.com a safe site?
I was browsing another site of mine when I accidentally clicked one of those mini google ad links and it brought me to gozilla.com. I'm not saying there is anything wrong on my computer but I get very paranoid about accidentally clicking links to unknown sites.

Nothing is wrong with my computer and all I did was, it went to the page and I clicked "back" in about like 3 seconds with being on the page. Is this site safe? And even if it wasn't could it do harm to my computer from being on it for 3 seconds?
It wasn't a google sponsored link, it was just a sponsored link for IMDB.com, is it safe?
It may have also been Gozzillaflix.com, is that one safe?

clicking the link can give u a virus dude. but it looks like its ok.
I know people that have been on that site before many times, and it has never harmed their computer.  I'm pretty sure that your computer is fine.
It should be okay. McAfee Siteadviser and Norton Safe Web say so.
gozillaflix.com is also safe according to those same sites.
