why can't I load some sites?! 5 stars asap today!?
So I have the crappy Verizon DSL connection. It's raining in my area but I asked my neighbor friends if their DSL works and they said theirs was fine.

Some sites won't load for me like Yahoo! mail, Twitter, etc. Facebook, my search engine, and other sites works for me though. Its like 50% working, the other 50% doesn't. AIM works fine.

what is wrong?
I scanned my PC for viruses, there's nothing wrong.
I tested my connection, it seems fine.

I am using windows XP, using mozilla firefox. I tested windows IE and it doesn't load the same pages either. I cleared cookies, cache, etc. My firewall is on. I turned it off to see if anything changes, nothing did.

is my computer the problem, or my internet?

Sometimes it appears that acomputer will especially act up in the rain. I have found that you can reset the Network.
Shut your computer clear OFF
Pull the power adapter from both the MODEM and the ROUTER.
Wait like 5 minutes and then Plug in the Modem and wait at least 1 minute.
Now Plug in the ROUTER and wait 1 minute.
Now you can restart your computer. Be sure you let the computer boot all the way up and now give it a whirl.
I would recommend you to call verizon because the problem may be with the service, it looks like its disconnecting you from the internet, they have a couple tests that can determine if you are getting a stable connection.
