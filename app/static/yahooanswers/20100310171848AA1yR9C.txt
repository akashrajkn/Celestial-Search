Is IMVU inappropriate for a 10-11 yr old?

And the 10-11 knows more adult stuf than most 10-11 year olds do

Unaccompanied, the entire internet is inappropriate for a kid of that age!
I would say yes. The clothes are really provocative, and some of the emoticons used are more for adults.
As a sixteen year old i feel that as a ten year old stuff like that should be off limits i mean it all flirting with other people and teaching them things like dressing in slutty clothes are okay.... it is just another web site that helps lower children's self esteem.  I use to play sims all the time last year and i felt that i could never be any good at anything if i did not look or act like the sims people did.... but it is all based on the opinion of the parents
Even if the child knows more than most, its important to remember they are still a child. IMVU does have younger members but I do not recommend it. I am an avid IMVU and recommend it to anyone, that happens to be 14 and over. My child is 11, I would NEVER let them play on IMVU, there are too many predators and too many simply put.."mean" people. It can be harsh, even if the child "knows more adult stuff" Still, at 11 how much can the child know?
