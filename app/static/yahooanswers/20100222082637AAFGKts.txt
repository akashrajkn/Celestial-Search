Hey everyone can someone help me? its about lockerz alert when i tried to subscribe it wants me to do the?
survey every time i do the survey and i wait for box to disappear nothing happens it loads and still says offer not complete please help

lockerz is a scam honestly They give away to many points for doing nothing. I see people selling there accoutns because they never think theyu will recieve a return on there time.
actually ken, it's NOT a scam. they can afford to give out so many prizes because there is a LIMITED amount. they allow redemption's on a scheduled basis, and if you don't get to the prize before someone else, then too bad, your sunk, and you have to wait 'till next time. and it DOES work, and ya i was skeptical at first but at last redemption, i got a 16 gig iPod touch. and this next upcoming one, i aim to get Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. the way that lockerz makes its money is the polls that you answer daily. the polls you answer are tallied, and then sold to a company that can make use of the information. that's how they afford the prizes.

and to the question, sorry i don't know what your asking. i don't know of any... subscriptions. if you can explain a little more, that would be great.
