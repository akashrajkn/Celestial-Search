Where is the Paypal Plus credit card login?
I used to access my account from the Paypal Plus/GE Money website. Now when you go to this website it redirects you to Paypal.com. When I log in there is no sign of my credit card statement or activity. Paypal's "Help" section says you should go to Account Overview and click on See Statement Activity. There is no link that says that. Paypal's entire site is nothing but a mess! I just want to know where to go to log into my CC account. Has anyone else had this problem? Thank you!

I'm having the same issue! I've been on the line with them for a while and no one seems to have a resolution. My best solution would be to pay off the remaining balance through the phone and cancel the card.
