my internet explorer sucks?
it opens websites fine but it does not follow any link when i click on any link it doesn't take it

IE is LAME. Download Firefox. WAY better. IE ALWAYS has problems. and is super slow. Firefox comes with  a built in popup blocker too :)
dude, u shouldn't even be using internet explorer, people can hack into more accs and pws now in that. use mozilla firefox
Get google chrome. 
It is faster and I have had no problems with it. It also looks better and you can customize your tab bar theme.
if you have windows internet explorer 8 it should axcept aything
switch to firefox or chrome......ive already had a bad experience with internet explorer...its a bit old-fashioned.
