may be something wrong with your internet connection. 
try another browser
I had a problem where Internet explorer wasn't working or when it did it would look for the home page but got so far and stuck.

To fix my internet explorer I

Click on Start button
Go to All Programs
Go to Accessories
I double Clicked on Command Prompt

This will bring up a Black window

Type netsh 
press enter
type winsock reset catalog
press enter

I rebooted my computer and my frends internet explorer now works.

Hope this works
