Is lockerz.com too good to be true?
I just don't know what to think.
I haven't had it to long so I'm wondering is it really as good as it seems?
and if you want to check for yourself just e-mail me i'll invite you.
i'm just not sure you know :p hahaa

WAY TOO GOOD I PEED MY PANTS
It works but i can never get anything because i dont know how to. I click redeem and then what?
Lockerz is legit. Its just very difficult to win prizes. They do not announce when theyll have their redemption. And it only lasts for 30 secs. But it is possible.

Just a suggestion if your looking for another site to win free things, but even better. Try Swagbucks. Its just like a google search engine but you randomly win swagbucks for searching the web. There are also other ways of getting swagbucks, such as swagcodes. The prizes are always in stock in the Swagstore. Ive made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards. Many more prizes too. Check it out!! The facebook wall will help. Swagbucks is too good to be true!
