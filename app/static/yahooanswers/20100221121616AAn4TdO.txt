Browser doesn't load (5mins broken-5 mins works-...) while I do have internet connection?
I'm having this problem for a pretty long time now. Any browser I try can't load any pages during some time (usually +-5 min). After that it runs fine for about 5 mins and then stops loading any new page for another period of +-5 min, this cycle keeps repeating.

I do have internet connections in the moments the browsers are not working (I can talk to people on msn messenger etc).

Anyone got any idea on how to solve this?
tried these browsers (all are running and down at same periods of time): IE, firefox, chrome, cometbird
its not my overall speed thats bad, its periods it doesnt work at all and periods it works really good

this depends on alot of things if u have dial up its gana take long if u have cable it shoudnt it should be really fast and if u have satilite its a mid speed... also if ur using safari stop it sucks i use fire fox it works on windows to i only use fire foxs its the fastest and safest wat to go :)
