Why do Cell phone providers have a 5gb cap on laptop data?
Ok, this is a serious question about wireless internet service. I want to know why almost all companies put a 5gb cap on laptop data. "Because they're greedy" and "They're dumb" won't cut it. I want to know if it ACTUALLY costs them more money to provide service if a customer uses more data. Other than a nominal server energy cost, does it really cost THEM more, or is it just a clever money-making tactic? I know putting up the physical tower-network is anything but cheap, but really? My example question is "Does it cost them more money to supply 10mb of data than 1mb?" If so, how much more? I want to have a deeper understanding of how things work. Any real help will be appreciated."

I'm not sure exactly how much, but of course it costs more to send out more. Hence why things like video messages are more than picture messages if you don't have a plan. This is also why some ISP's have a bandwidth cap.
