i am in a talk talk broadband of 30gb / month. how many hours a day does that allow me to use the internet?
i am just normally on facebook, yahoo messenger, blogs, and a little of youtube and other video watching sites.
i normally go on the internet for 15 hours a day and do facebook, youtube and some other video watching for about 3-4 hours, and the rest downloading pictures and chatting. do you think i am going overboard?
ohh and i downloaded about 20-30 songs today from limewire.
*sigh

Depends totally on what you do online.  If you watch a lot of videos, you will eat that allotment up very fast!
A fair bit - download a free broadband usage to keep an eye on what you are using

Go over them limit and get a HUGE bill - been there!!!
try net limiter gadget
to see a real time usage
it is impossible to calculate the time allowed based on quantity of data. You could use 30Gb in a month or one day. It depends on how much you download/upload (unless your plan doesn't count uploads). Usually what uses up most data is large video and music files, downoading large size files and attachments, some online gaming, etc...It is best to check your usage on your ISP internet account and move up to higher plan if 30Gb is insuffcient.
As you have a small cap if you download this small free program. 

It¡¯s only 1.15 MB ?

You can set it with your cap. It will show a running display of your usage [all up and downloads] and keep running logs on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. It will also, work out daily what you have left for the rest of the month and how much you can use each day. It will also warn you when you are approaching that limit.

It will also give some idea how fast your using your limit.

Have a look at Screen Shots in the left hand column on the Home Page and you will see how it works.
