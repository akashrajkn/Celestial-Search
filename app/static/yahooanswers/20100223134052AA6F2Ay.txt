Good Internet Browser which ISN'T FireFox, IE8, Opera, Chrome, or Safari?
I have a Windows 7 computer, and spend a lot of  time on the internet, most especially -forums, chatbox, and Facebook.  I also do online writing in an RPG.

I like the look and features of FireFox (and opera for that matter) HOWEVER, neither one of them work well on my computer.  FireFox locks up a lot and opera isn't very "quality looking" for some reason.  I don't like Chrome because it is so simple.  I have IE8 but it likewise locks up and I hate it.  I'm not big on Safari either.

What else is there that is a good browser?  My favorite features of FireFox are things like: spell check, remembering passwords, saving tabs, SPEED DIAL.

Hope someone can help :)

well check out K-meleon.....its a browser...i havent used it yet but perhaps it might help...!!
Looks like you're left with Maxthon then, most of the other alternatives are 'lite' versions that make Chrome look sophisticated

It's a bit too busy for my liking and it uses the IE core, but it has many fans
i use Firefox. and think it,s good. because it has some option which is not available for other browser .and i think  the IE  is slow .thanks
