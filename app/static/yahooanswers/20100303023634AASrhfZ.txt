Weird problems going on in FormSpring.Me?
I have this weird problem where I log into my account and when I just press on 'Following' or 'Profile', it just turns into someone else's account! This has happened so many times and I'm really confused... it's just breaking into other people's accounts without me doing anything. I really want to see the answers people put to my questions but whenever I press 'Following' it just turns into a complete stranger's account. Please help!

formspring.me is having issues, mine wont even take me to the page. it's been getting worked on for a while now because i remember logging in and it saying it was having technical difficulties. give it time.
