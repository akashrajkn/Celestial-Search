i have Internet Explorer and Firefox is it possible to have a home page on each?


Your "Home Page" is just the first page that your web browser (like IE and Firefox) open up to. So yes you can have a different home page on each browser. 

The only thing you cannot do is have both of them be your default browser at the same time.
You have to change the Homepage option in the Preferences option window to set your favorite site as homepage.

Btw this is a nice plugin to try out for firefox

Sure, the settings are separate for each browser...
