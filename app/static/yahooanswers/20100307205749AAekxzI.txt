What could you do if you are bored?
I am so bored and I have nothing to do. Have an answers for my question?

I read a book. Being unemployed and injured .... I've been reading a lot lately. LOL
well that is a simple question, but no simple answer lol, only limited to how much fun you can get into haha, maybe you could learn to use linux to avoid confusion when microsoft goes out of business lol, its easy to learn and free
Jerk off!
