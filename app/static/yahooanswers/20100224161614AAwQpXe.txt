Question about Tumblr.com?
When you first get an account, on the main screen, it says e-mail address. Is it asking for your e-mail (e.g. blahblahblah@aol.com) or is it asking for your username that your going by on the site. Thanks.

It's asking for an existing e-mail address, which you will then afterwards also use to log in on the site.
your e-mail
It's just asking for your email. Your username is different.
