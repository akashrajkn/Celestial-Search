Does anybody know of a fairly new and/or underpopulated Pokemon forum?
Yeah... I really want to join a Pokemon forum, but I feel rater intimidated by the bigger ones like Bulbagarden and Serebii and Pokemopolis because I don't want to seem like a total n00b when everybody has like, over 9000 posts and I joined yesterday and have 2. xDD

The forums you mentioned are quite good, and you should join one of them. There is a section called, "Newbie lounge" for people who have just joined, which is where you should go after you join.
