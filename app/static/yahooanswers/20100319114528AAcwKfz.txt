What should I name a blog?
I want to document all the odd, crazy, funny, unique situations and dealings I've had with customers and people in general.  I'll keep it all confidential, but just want to share stories with my family and friends.  

For example, I had a customer today ask if we could refund her estate if she died before we were able to provide her with what she had just paid for.  

And the other day, I had an older gentleman walk in at work and say "Well Hello, there, Woody!".  

I want the blog name to be fun and humorous, but catchy.

Odd Work Days / Odd Work Moments (?)
OWD / OWM

Something catchy depends on your opinion.
