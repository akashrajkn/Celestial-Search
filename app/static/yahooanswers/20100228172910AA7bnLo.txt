Prizerebel Custom Order Question?
I just custom ordered a video game from ebay through prizerebel. How long will it take for processing/delivery? Will they contact me through phone? What if somebody purchases it before they process it? Thanks for your help.

It really depends on where you live for delivery.
I live in Ontario, Canada and it took 3 weeks to get to my house.
No, they don't contact your phone.
They usually approve prizes in 3 days tops, but if there's any problem they'll deny the order and the reason will be sent to your email.

Answer mine?
