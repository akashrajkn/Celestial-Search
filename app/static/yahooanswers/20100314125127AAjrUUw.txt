Have you heard of http://www.cleverhive.com? It's for girls ages 9 - 15.  You can write your own "How to" guides pertaining to any topic (boys, fashion, beauty, school, etc.) and learn from other users.  It's a great way to interact with other girls around the same age and learn some cool new things.
