On forums, what does "bump" mean?


It's a term put in a post meaning that the post is used to "bump" the thread to the top of the forum listing so people can see it.
The topic has not received any activity and "bump" means putting it back to the top or into the spotlight to gain more attention.
It makes an old post return to the top of the home page. 

That is, it "bumps" it back to the top of the order by adding a new page to the discussion.
People usually write BUMP when nobody is replying to to their thread. Makes their thread look active.
