I am making a glogster for skool, but I have a lot more to add, and my page is too short.?
Is there anyway I can keep adding pages so as I go along, It will be long enough?

You can't make your Glog longer.

What you can do is make multiple Glogs and link then together, so that all you have to do is click "Next", or whatever you choose to put, and you'll be at your next page
