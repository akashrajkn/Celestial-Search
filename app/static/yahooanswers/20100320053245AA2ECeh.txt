Do you use a Mobile Broadband Dongle?
If you do, what are the advantages, or disadvantages to the one you're using?
Okay, I should have been more specific I think. :-)
I'm looking at Pay As You Go dongles, and I want to know if you use one, Which one is it and do you like it? Why?

Pro's - Its small, No wires for internet around the house, dont have to have a contract if go PAYG, really fast connexion, can use the internet everywhere

Con's - Can get some great package deals with BT, Sky etc, something else to remember to carry around in your laptop bag

Cant think of much else :)
Works great. Cost too much
Try a mobile broadband coverage checker to see how good the reception in your area is first. Then go with the company that offers the best reception. You can find on here http://www.laptopsforfree.co.uk. There's nothing worse than a bad reception and slow internet so maybe you should consider this first and the look around the net to see what the best offers are for that company.
