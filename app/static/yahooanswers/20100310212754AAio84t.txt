Formspring help despirate!!!?!?!?!!!! QUICK ANSWERS PLEASE!!!?
Ok so a few days ago i got a formspring. everything was fine. then 2 days ago i left facebook and formspring up and my siblings had written on some girls formspring that she saw on the facebook homepage. I didn't notice what she had done until today when they wrote on another girls account. then i saw what she had written on girl 1's account. Then i write on it apologizing that it was a mistake and the wrong account and try to cover it up by completely changing the image of the account. (on both) i feel terrible about what had happened in just a few days and by thinking about how schools is gonna be tomorrow. hell. so i just made up fake questions to cover up the mess. Then it gets worse. people knew it was me and they were writing me questions that were rude so i disabled my account. How can i deal with this in school tomorrow? What do i do? Its gonna be awful i can see it coming. 


What the sibs had written on the formsprings are 

Girl 2: are you prude? (they know more than you think)
Girl 1: do you like _______________? (because i had said to them that i don't think that girl likes me. 


I got myself into a huge mess trying to cover their act and i wasn't creeping at all. How can i deal with this?

Go to a new school.
You shouldn't have covered it up in the first place. Just be honest and say, "My sister was trying to play a prank. Sorry." Laugh it off too, and have your friends laugh it off with you. If they're still creeped out, just avoid appearing like a creeper for a while, even though you aren't anyway. But whatever you do, don't get super serious about it or get visibly upset if they don't believe you. That'll just make you look more suspicious.
