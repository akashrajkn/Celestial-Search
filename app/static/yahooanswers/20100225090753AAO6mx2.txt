why won't mozilla 3.6 install?
I have a computer that had TONS of problems and missing drivers. I now have zero exclamation points nor any other odd mark in the device manager. It did nor does it now have any malware, adware, spyware, viruses etc. it is clean. I have ran Ccleaner, sweepi, defrag, windows update, etc. All seems fien. It tells me my computer is not up to par. It asks for at least a 500MHZ computer.This one is 2.0 GHZ, it has well over 125 GIGs of free space, 1 gig ram and a good GPU. What could be the problem?

mabe you already have it
use google chrome
would need to know what operating system you have and what error message you get
check the registry edit for mozilla and delete it.
Your computer package may simply not compatible with it
Giving the error message really helps.

If your computer is not 'up to par' according to the setup file, remove EVERY driver and RE-INSTALL every one of them, one at the time.

every computer should be able to run firefox these days, and your problem is probably caused by the bad drivers.
If you can¡¯t find the right drivers manually I would recommend just getting a software program that can do it for you. There is a program I use which will find drivers for just about all hardware devices. The best part is it takes a snapshot of your system specifications and matches the right driver to go with it.
