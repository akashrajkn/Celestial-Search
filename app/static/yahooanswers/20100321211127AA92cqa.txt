How do i kick someone off my...?
router but i don't want to turn it off like where do i go in the 192.168.1.1 for westell verizon . because my brothers on myspace all day and i get home around like 8 and i would like to play a round or 2 of call of duty or world of warcraft but its soo laggy cause hes on myspace

Merely being on Myspace should not create enough lag to interfere with World of Warcraft or other online games.  Are u sure he is not doing some other activity...such as downloading items from torrents or similar activities?

But to directly answer your question...Yes u can find his MAC address and ban it in the router's configuration screen.  The router should report the MAC address somewhere in its status reports so u can get it that way.  Routers differ on where this function is located, so u will have to browse the setup screens.
