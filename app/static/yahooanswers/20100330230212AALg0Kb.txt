how can i get more experience with call of duty?
i really want to get started on playing call of duty, its just that when i ask my brother if i can play, he gets mad ( for some apparent reason) and tells me to go away. i think he doesn't want me to die too many times on his account. so how do i get more experience with this game, and get good enough so that i can attempt to play? also i hate asking my brother for help, so i want to get at a good enough stage when i can just tell my brother to leave and let me have fun.

Pass the campaign.
You should make your own account. It's only 8 dollars a month on xbox live. I'm sure you can scrounge up 8 dollars in a month. And you should play ( and beat ) the game on veteran. Then I'm sure you'll have enough experience to play well.
tell him to 1 v 1 him and kick his asss

and use m16 with stopping power and deep impact if its cod 4
or 
if its mw2
