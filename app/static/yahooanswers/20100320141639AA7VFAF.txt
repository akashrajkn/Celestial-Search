Is it better to make a new account or not? Gaia Online?
I've had an account on gaia for years, its at least an '06 account. I play the game off an on, usually starting completely over when I come back (most of the people I knew have quit) I think I'll start again. It would be kind of neat to start completely fresh, no one knowing who I am (I'd move all my expensive stuff over) but then I lose the credit of having an old acount. Should I start over or not?

Quit.

Gaia sucks.
I think it would be better to give me all your gaia money =P

I like gaia but the fact that everything costs so much puts me off, Ive never reached over 1,000 so I dont really use it much anymore. Bugs me that I want my character to look like a Gladiator yet it would take me forever to earn the cash for it.

My answer would be to find a better site with less hastle =)
All social networking sites get boring eventually, but starting a new account does give you more to do, so go for it
Make a new one (:

If you dont want to delete your account because its old,i'd be happy to have it, or maintain it or something ^^ I just reactivated my account so im on alot now o.o
