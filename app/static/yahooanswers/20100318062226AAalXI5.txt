Ebay: how do you find out if you have received an unpaid item strike?

ive checked feedback but i cant find it, but im pretty sure i got one a few months ago
oh and the item isnt there any more :/ haha, maybe its been removed as i cant seem to find it and ive looked everywhere

Check your feedback or look for an e-mail from eBay/PayPal
check in your ebay account under the item description.. I mean the item you won.
