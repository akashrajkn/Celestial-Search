Please HELP. . .Is there someone that can please preform a reverse cell number search for me?
I really need to do a reverse number search to a cell phone that keeps pranking my home, work, and cell. Does anyone have a yearly subscription to phone detective or another cite that gives info.?
Please help if you are able too . . .Your kind favor is sincerely appreciated.
I can not afford to pay for the search. If you are able to do so . . . please email me the information at Katherine.starry@gmail.com

the number that is pranking is 773-640-4960

Call the phone company and report them! What they are doing is very iilegal!
(773) 640-4960

This number is a landline based in Chicago, IL and is unpublished.
that number is included in a long list of numbers that call you and just hang up.
I had a problem similar to this one and did soooooooooooooo much research on the number that kept calling and it turned up that the person who live in my address before me owed some money and a Financial agency was trying to collect so they used a bogus number to see if anybody was home and later called with another number trying to speak to the person who lived there previously. 
 ( reason they called with bogus number is that the person didn't answer the phone when Caller ID said Private or the Financial company name)
I finally talked to the financial company many many times  convinced them that person didn't live there anymore and they stopped calling, they explained they go by address to look for someone because people tend to change phone numbers easier than address.

hope this helps

I have done quite a bit of research on this and the only way to search for a cell phone number for free is by searching it on Google. For example type in:
¡°555-555-5555¡±

Cell phone numbers unlike landline numbers are kept private so they are not available publicly through the phone book or yellow pages. It is actually illegal for the phone companies to make cell phone data public domain.

Unfortunately searching for it through Google often very rarely tells you anything about the person.

There is however a way to identify the cell number¡¯s identity, address, and a lot more.  You do need to pay a small fee to get this information because it is private and services pay a lot of money to gain access to the cell phone directory.

But you can search and preview the results for free. If you are not satisfied afterward they offer a full 60 day guarantee to get a refund.

The service I have used with the most success can be found at  Spyspace - http://spyspace.org/

Simply enter the phone number in the search box to view the instant results.
