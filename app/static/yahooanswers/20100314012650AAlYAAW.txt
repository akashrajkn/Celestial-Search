What is a good website for ranting?
I'm pissed off and I need something to vent.
Re: pdxsdh 

Interesting. How about you go troll somewhere else?

chatroulette.com hahaha
Open your window and tell it to someone who cares. Why do you have to be on computer to rant. 99% of people dont want to hear rants anyway. The 1% that do care are probably family and friends. Do you really need a website to chat with family or friends?

Just open up NotePad or Word or something you can type in and pour it all out there.  I find that helps me.  And it's not on the internet so that when you cool down, you don't end up going, "Crap!  Why did I put all that there for everyone to read.  How embarassing and stupid!!"
