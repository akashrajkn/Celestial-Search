Is this site offline for you?
I cannot access this website. 
For some reason when I last updated it the site is having problems.

Thanks guys.
When I published the site I accidentally also published a page which was supposed to be deleted, but it was still in the "pages" folder.  This caused the entire site to be taken offline until I republished it with the page fully deleted.
It isn't working again. 
I tried updating it, and it suddenly went offline.

works for me
Nope, works fine!

Try going into command prompt (If you have Vista or Seven you need to run it in elevated mode, to do this go to Start->type 'cmd' without the quotes->Right click on first entry and select 'Run as Administrator'. If you have XP or lower go Start->Run->Type 'cmd' without the quotes), then type 'ipconfig -flushdns' without the quotes. This may fix it. Otherwise try turning your router/modem/computer all off at once, count to 10 and turn them back on.
Nope works fine.
This is a site I use it comes in very handy!
