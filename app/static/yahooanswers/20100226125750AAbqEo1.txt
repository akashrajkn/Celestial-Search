Why is nicktropolis.com so slow today?
I dont know why but today (2/26/2010/) I made a nicktropolis and Me and friend decided to go on together and it took a hour to load...I was wondering if the site was in problems or anything...It wasnt just my computer....it  also happened to my friend, and my moms computer I cant get on and I dont know how to get on nicktropolis...It would be so nice if someone can answer it..

Thanks

2 theories.

1- if it has been just created, you may need to reboot the computer (Restart it)

2- Nicktropolis might be undergoing Technical difficulties or under maintenance.

Good luck!
