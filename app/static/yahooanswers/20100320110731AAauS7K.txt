If i'm using Firefox, can someone get on my computer and see my history on Internet Explorer 8?


If they felt like it, sure.
no.
Each browser has it's own history files.
Each web browser keeps its history separate. Your Firefox history doesn't appear in Internet Explorer and vice-versa. If you go to Tools>Clear Recent History in Firefox then it will delete your history.
