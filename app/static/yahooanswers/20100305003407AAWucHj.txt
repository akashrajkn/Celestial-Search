Will Blogging content of Various Sites findings lead to copyright infringement, Will mentioning Source help?
I like to collect information from various sites. There are time when I like few points while reading a site. I would like to blog my findings. Will I face a copyright issue if i directly copy paste the few points from other sites? I have seen the usage of "source". If i mention the source, will it help?

By copying the whole thing yes you can get in trouble, taking a few points and giving credit to the source might maybe be okay but your best bet would be to get the permission from the original author for anything you want to use that someone else wrote! (and get permission before you use it not after) Also i think it all depends on what your using.
My advice = don't copy other people's work in any way or form!!!
Hope that can help a bit ;-)
