Help!! Why won't the......................?
Little button  ON AIM EXPRESS that says "edit" (where you can put your picture) actually work!? Every time I press the stupid thing, it doesn't open up a  new window that says "take a picture with webcam' or "upload from your computer" or something. Its like the link to that button is broken... And it works on other computers! WHY??? help me. thank you !
