Best Online Photo Editing Site?
Well, there's lots of photo-editing sites, I've been on lots, but I want to know which ones the best? Lots of people say to use photoshop but to be honest I dont know how to use photoshop, I use picnik and fotoflexer, so what photo editing site do you use?

Picnik is pretty good. That's what I use atm. If you think Photoshop is hard to use, search for tutorials on the internet and then you might be good to go.
Just search "Photo Editing Sites" on Google!
Or, I could probably make a tutorial of how to use Photoshop?
I've got Photoshop CS4 :)
