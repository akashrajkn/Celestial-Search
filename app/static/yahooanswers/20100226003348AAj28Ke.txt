Why are you buying dirty things behind your parents backs?
send it to a friend and tell him/her to give back to you
There is no way...of course not all parents have their kids best interests at heart but 99.999999999% of us do.  If your folks don't want you to have something, there is probably a good reason for it. If you are having trouble talking to your parents, ask another adult you trust about this purchase you want to make and see what he/she thinks.  I'll bet it's a bad idea.  PS, if you are only 12, you are too young to be on Yahoo answers.
Just ask one of your parents to order it for you. Then they will know all about it and you won't get in trouble.
Just download the gay porn off da internets
