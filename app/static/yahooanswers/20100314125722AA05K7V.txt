How to post a long piece of writing on livejournal.?
I want to post fanfiction on liveournal but I'm finding myself very confined by the limit on the length of journal entries. I managed to get roughly 2,200 words into one at least but my chapters can go up to 6000 normally. An LJ cut doesn't let you make it longer either. Can someone please tell me how I can post my fanfiction in one piece?
