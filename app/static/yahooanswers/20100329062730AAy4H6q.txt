Do you have experincee with Sky broadband and phone?
I have lots of problems with TalkTalk, very bad service and connection. Only stayed with them because of international calls. I found that Sky gives international calls too. But how about their connection and services?

Hi,

TalkTalk I agree has a very bad service at times, Sky connection is very stable and they provide a very good customer service/ technical support, also the good thing when you go with a major company if there is an issue they have a much better support network who can get the problem resolved.  Go with Sky, Virgin or BT I say.

Hope that helps.
