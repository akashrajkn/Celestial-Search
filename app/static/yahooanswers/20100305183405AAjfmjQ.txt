Since installing malwarebytes, I am no longer able to access a particular web page I  on either IE or Firefox?
I had been able to access this page anytime until I installed Malwarebytes. I also had upgraded my version of Internet Explorer around the same time as I installed Malwarebytes.  How can I solve this issue?

remove that crap and install adaware... seriously!
Try deleting malwarebytes first
You haven't given us much to go on. What happens when you try to access the web page?  Does it give you an error page in the browser?  Does a message box come up? What do they say?

About all I can say from the evidence, is that a new version of Internet Explorer should have no effect on Firefox.

Sorry.  Maybe if you post more information someone will be able to help you more.
