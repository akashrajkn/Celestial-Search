Can someone check and see if Lockerz videos is working for them?
I'm a member of the social site Lockerz which allows you to earn points for prizes for literally nothing.
Recently the video section of the site has not allowed me to play videos. Can someone give one of the videos a try from there computer. This way I will know if the problem is on my side or theirs.

Thank you.

Seems fine for me.
I think lockerz don't work well, the all video is fake!

It will be better use this service: sonsoldi.it

The only services certainly working are on "sonsoldi".
