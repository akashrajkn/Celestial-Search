Does anyone know if the Website Lockerz is a scam?
A buddy invited me to it, and I don't know if it truly works. (They're out of everything atm). It seems to me like it would because of the mandatory advertisements, they must make a lot of money. Anyone ever receive a prize from them or know if it works?

Just curious before I spend the next day earning points that are useless.

ty in advance

At a guess it's a  Pyramid Scheme scam fraud ... 

The only way to 'make' anything from such scams is to suck in more mugs ... (this is why your mate sent you an 'invite' no doubt :-) )
Lockerz is a real company. It is funded by Liberty Media, one of the largest media companies in the US. The Chief Executive Officer of Lockerz is Kathy Savitt, a former executive at Amazon.com and American Eagle Outfitters.

Here's how it work:
Lockerz uses PTZ, its currency unit.

Lockerz members earn PTZ by answering daily question (+2 PTZ) and clicking "log in" (+2PTZ) everyday.
They can also earn more PTZ by watching video in PLAY section (+2 PTZ per video).
And when they invite someone to join Lockerz, they earn PTZ for this (+2 PTZ per accepted invite)..
If they invite 20 people and more, they get Z-Lister title, it's mean they get double PTZ for their activities (answer daily question, log in, watch video, invite someone... +4 PTZ).

What's PTZ used to do?
Every month, Lockerz hold a redeem day (usually at the end of month) and you can use your PTZ to redeem prizes. There're a lot of prizes (Macbook, Iphone, Ipod, Ipad, xbox360, cash...), you can go to REDEEM section for more.

That's what I know about Lockerz!

Have fun!
