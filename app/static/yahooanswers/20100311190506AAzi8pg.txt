I can't load videos from JW Player and a few others?
I'm very frustrated because I am watching Fairy Tail and I use the JW Player from OnePieceOfBleach website.
Now, suddenly, I can't load the video. It's not white screen or anything. It's fine but when i press play it goes the usual buffering but it won't start at all.
I've tried with all my browsers, Opera, Google Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
So can someone help me a little, pretty please??

Hey I know how  frustrating this can be, so I hope this helps you. There is a new program, free to download, that you can use to watch videos on the internet. It can be found at the web address: http://vdownloader.com/  and will begin to work immediately! With this program it can convert the videos you watch for your other devices than a computer, such as your MP3, Ipod or Ipad, and even mobile phones! You can then use this program to watch movies, youtube videos, music downloads, and many other internet regularities! VDownloader is a great, free way to watch videos on the internet, hassle free!
