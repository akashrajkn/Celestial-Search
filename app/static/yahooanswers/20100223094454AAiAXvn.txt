I have a website through Yahoo and I can't add tabs within a page?
I have website and I can't add tabs, how do I add tabs on a page through yahoo?  I was thinking about switching to another web host.  I've seen godaddy and it seems easier to design a webpage through them.  Are there any other recommendations for switching to antoher web host or is there a way through yahoo that I can add tabs to a site page?
