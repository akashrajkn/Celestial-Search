Can anyone recommend a torrent download site that works, is popular and clean, with NO porn graphics on it?
I hate that!

No but I can recommend installing Firefox with the Ad Block Plus addon. 

That should get rid of the majority of porn adverts, and you can manually block the rest.

It's actually a great addon to have whatever websites you visit.
