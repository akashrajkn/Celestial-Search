Try submitting your blog to directories to increase your link popularity.in time this will give you a better ranking in search engines.
Start following other blogs similar to yours which have more followers and start commenting on them. Link their blogs in your blog. They will start visiting your blog and if it is relevant they will link it, and it will be exposed to all the followers of the popular blog. This is responsible for how 90% of all blogs establish their networks.

 Other than this, publish your posts and updates on facebook, twitter, IM etc... use aggregators like Digg... 

There are also some loose blogging consortiums that you can look up but they are rare and very topical and conservative about their content.

Good luck!
go blogger.com and make your blog
