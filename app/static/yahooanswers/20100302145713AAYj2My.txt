Will I get into trouble if I sign under a fake name and birthday in adultfanfiction.net?
There are some stories that I want to read on adultfanfiction.net that aren't available in fanfiction.net. Like some of the interesting story lines would be in aff.net 

I'm eighteen already, but I'm not comfortable with signing under my real name and birthday. 

Will I get in trouble if I sign under a fake name and birthday?

It's the internet. Nobody's going to care.
Obviously, yes. Impersonation is a felony.

Either get "comfortable" or don't go there.
no, dont worry,
as long as its not some one elses real name, and as long as its not government owned youll be fine
