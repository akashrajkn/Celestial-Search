Why do so many web pages get taken over by bitching women?
I have been a member of a few web site forums and every one seems to be taken over by a group of bitching women who act like school bullies and need other idiots to join in with them to be part of the gang as they're too stupid or scared to speak for themselves. The first one was a message board about hair and make-up and the latest one is a fan page on facebook for Craig Busch the lion man. It isn't just me. I see other people being bullied and when I speak out against it, I just get attacked by the gang members to become bullied myself. Why are groups of supposedly adult women like that?

it makes them feel younger since they are getting older
The internet is (mostly) annoymous.  People think they can hide behind their computers and do/type whatever they want and to the most part, that is correct.  This allows them the freedom to do things that normally wouldnt get away with in "real life".
I'm sure what you feel as an injustice is actually a violation of policies and having the web page or site.
It's really no different to what goes on here in some categories and the Suggestion Board.

They're all like little packs of trolls or ankles biters going nit, nit, nit, nit, nit all over the place!

Come bedtime they all retreat under their respective bridges.
