How do I watch this movie online streaming WITHOUT subscribing (UK)?
I'm taking a British comedy class while studying abroad in London, and I'm doing a paper on the movie "Carry On... Up the Khyber." I want to watch it again, but my parents won't let me do any paid subscription services, even those with the free 2 week trial, because I always forget to unsubscribe.
But I dont have enough time to order it thru the mail before the paper is due. So, I need a place I can buy or rent just that one movie online streaming. I don't mind paying money it just can't be an ongoing subscription, and it needs to be accessible in the UK. Can someone please help? If you give me a useful link that meets this criteria, easy ten points! I don't even want free, I'm willing to pay for it! Just no subscription...
BTW I have a mac, so please don't send me to a place where I need windows to watch or or something =D

Carry On films are eternally popular - not only because of the humor but also because many of the original stars are now dead, and people like to watch their favorite old stars
