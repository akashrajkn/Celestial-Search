what are some good websites?
where is a good place to download free music?

This is illegal! Stop asking illegal questions!
I recommend you this site:
http://www.mp3-music-download-sites.com/resources/free-ipod-music-download.html
I use it to find my iPod music now , it provids large database of music and I can find almost all the music I want, you can have a try with it
And also, here is an article you can have a look:

starzik.com is a legal download website and you will be able to find free music, just fill in the search with "gratuit" and enjoy bonus from the artists.
http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ searches many free, safe (no-virus) legal music-downloading sites. For whole albums, add the word "rapidshare" :)

Hope this helps. Regards!
