What is a good website where teenagers can walk around and chat?

...You can walk around and chat in real life. 

Unless your laptop has one of those motion sensors that are supposed to stop the hard disk drive when you drop the computer to lessen damage, I don't know why whether you're walking around with your computer or sitting at a desk would make any difference. It would be hard to type though if you were walking around holding a computer, I suppose...

Find a forum devoted to discussion of a topic that you're interested in. Join that forum. Now you have hundreds, if not thousands, of other people interested in the same things you're interested in with whom you can talk. So if you are interested in hardware engineering, you can find some other people to team up with to create that motion detector chip for your laptop. 

Or usenet. There's always usenet.
