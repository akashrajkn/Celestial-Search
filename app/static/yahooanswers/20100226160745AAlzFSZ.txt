Are there any free web hosts that allow torrents to be linked to?
I would like to have releases on my site, i will not put any illegal material on the server i wont even store the torrents on the server and they will all be tracked externally, are there any free web hosts that allow this?

I run a few small sites on the internet, and free hosting fulfills everything I need, I recently found http://hypersink.com, it is totally free and as good as a paid hosting plan, cant beat it! The best one I have found in all the years I have played on the internet.
