Is it bad to run multiple anti-virus programs at once?
i've heard different opinions on this topic, even from professionals.
i run two (Avast and Malwarebytes) and never had a problem between the two.
and i was wondering if it is okay to have them both installed.
i'd like facts not opinions.

Running both at once will not harm your computer or cause it to "miss" searching files for a virus. Just make sure your computer is fast enough to run both programs :) That is a fact.
You 'd better have only one antivirus active to do the real-time scan (free ones are Avast, AVG Free or Antivir),but you can use more than one for the occasional full scan.
As long as the two anti virus programs don't interfere with each other,you're good to go.
Malwarebytes (just like SUPERAntispyware) is not an antivirus but an antispyware program. It doesn't conflict with any antivirus programs.
