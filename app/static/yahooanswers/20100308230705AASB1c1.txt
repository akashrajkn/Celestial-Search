Is "way2sms" a trust worthy site?


Yes it is a trust worthy site... it even asks the recipient if they want to continue receiving SMS from the sender if the sender sends many sms's
it is a very trusty site.
You sure create account in that i have 2 accounts and didn't get any spam form way2sms. It is free. You only give your cell number
its a very good site..
But there are many other sites that allows you to send sms without ads
ya I think so............
i used dis site for free sms and i think it is gud.
BETTER U USE WWW.160BY2.COM THIS IS VERY GOOD AND FAST SMS SITE
yes way2sms is the best free messaging site currently and its trust worthy. It wont cause any problem to your personal information. i am using it since it was made. No worries.

We cant say any site as a trust worthy site..
There are some hacker to hack our datas 
without the knowledge of the owner of the sit itself..

But in way2sms, up to me nothing is happened like that..
U can trust.. They r asking just mobile no. to register..

U can register without any kind of doubts. 
Its really good.. u can send group sms at a time.
It possess some SMS templates too to select from it under several categories.

Here u can use the Yahoo & Gmail messenger which comes along with this website...

Use it. U can feel the difference.
Yaa, it is
