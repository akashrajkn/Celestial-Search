Yes : http://www.malwarebytes.org/
No. its not a complete anti-virus.
It only provides support for malware detection and removal and lacks centralized management features.

It includes the same anti-malware engine and virus definitions that all other Microsoft desktop antimalware products share, including Forefront Client Security, Windows Live OneCare, and Windows Defender (Defender excludes the antivirus definitions which are separate from the antispyware definitions).
Yes microsoft security essentials is a complete anti virus and i am also using the same and has'nt created any problems till now, so don't worry and use it bindass.........
