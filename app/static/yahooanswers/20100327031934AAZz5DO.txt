is the internet going down the road of complete restriction by governments?
with the recent news and revelations about america planning to enforce a world wide law, in europe and england   to regulate the internet  and order internet service providers  to cut off  people from the internet  permanently   who download films or music illegally.


there's lots of other talk and rumours to that have been around for quite a while that say the government  in a very short time  will have absolute control over the internet  compared  to the previous  free  open   internet era.

things ive heard is that the government will eventually have full control over the net ,  will be able to  block sites  anti government  or that they dont want you to view    -  watching all your online activity  -  no more anonymity  -  banning  and jailing    all people that try to illegally download       -  jailing anyone  for   hate speech   ,  or speech  that someone decides they dont like   -   banning people  from the internet permanently . 

and just basically , the government taking full control of the internet , restricting and regulating it.

no more free, open internet.


i must admit  i do find these talks and rumours depressing  as i rely on the internet for so much.


any comments  ?  

 or do you think the internet is going this way  and that, the days of the free internet are drawing to a close ?

That first bit seems a tad ridiculous...that would mean someone would have to monitor aaaalll the places that people download stuff illegally. I doubt that alot.

And doesn't China already block sites from Chinese citizens? Don't see why it couldn't happen anywhere else...
