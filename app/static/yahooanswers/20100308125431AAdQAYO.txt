Maybe this shouldnt go here, but : Question about internet speed?
Question about internet speed?
i just got my own apartment, and i dont need much. However the only thing i need internet for is skyping or windows live video call to my girlfriend. We are very long distance. So, sudden link is the only provider in my area, and 1 mbps is 33 bucks , but the next one up is like 50! so i was wondering, is the 1 mbps internet speed fast enough for video calling. I hope so, I 'm just a poor college student! lol thanks

Yeah, it should be okay. It won't be the fastest connection on the block, but it should work okay for you.
