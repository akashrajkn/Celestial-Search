Firefox address bar problems?
I used to be able to type the web address in the url bar, click enter, and it would start loading the new page.  Now, I have to push the arrow next to it to make it go.  I know it's not my enter button that's broken, because it works for everything else.  Does anyone know how to fix this?

It's possible the problem is caused by an extension. Follow the link for troubleshooting info: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Troubleshooting+extensions+and+themes
