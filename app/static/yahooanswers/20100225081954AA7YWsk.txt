how does pay pal work on ebay? (never used it before)?
i was wondering how pay pal works on ebay or how ebay works. i know you put your bid but lets say i got the item the highest bidder. 

will the money come out of the pay pal account from the credit card or how does it work?

Never used ebay or pay pal before i don't shop online

It depends on what source you use for your PayPal payments.  Some people have their bank account pay for it, and use a credit card as a backup source.  Other people use just a credit card to make payments!
Depends how you sign up to pay with paypal.  You will buy the item in Ebay, pay with paypal.  Paypal will send to appropriate funds to Ebay which in turn will pay the seller.

First of all, you have to have a pay pal account set up all ready. Pay pal has to verify you bank account and stuff. Once that is done with that, you are ready  to use ebay. 

To pay with pay pal on ebay,  just log on to pay pal when it shows the pay pal option on ebay when buying an item.
Ebay owns paypal so they are fairly well linked. You can set it up so that when you've won the item you bid on, the payment will transfer over automatically, or you can go to paypal and then authorize the payment.

Normally you would sign up for paypal with either your credit card and/or your bank account.
You *can* get a paypal account without having a credit card or bank account. You would need to have someone transfer money to your account to buy things.
