Online Shoppers! I need your  help!?
I am in need of a item it is called a Hauppauge 1212 HD-PVR High Definition Personal Video Recorder. But, everywhere online it's back ordered until early March! I really need some help to find a website that has them in stock.
Amazon is sold out to. Saying(Usually ships in 2 to 4 weeks) is their way of saying we are sold out.

Well, the one that I know that has, is this one:

Not sure if you already took a look there but I decided to tell you anyway in case you had not looked here yet.
