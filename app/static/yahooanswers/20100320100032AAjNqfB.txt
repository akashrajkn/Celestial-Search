When someone from Canada buys an ebay item and wants it shipped to the US,how do you change the shipping?
Is it safe to do this?  Right now,my shipping prices all say international.

It's not illegal or anything, although I'm sure it's frowned upon. :)  I once sold something where they asked me to ship to a UPS store in Niagara so they could just drive down and pick it up and avoid duties, taxes, etc. 

I would just change it when you print the shipping label.
