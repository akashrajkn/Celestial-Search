Is Full Tilt Poker a scam? It is like they take ur money and u get to play against there computer program?
Pokerstars is the same way plus they make it impossible to cash out but its real EASY to make a deposit

blame the government, it used to be REAL easy to cash out
All online poker is a scam...they are all slightly programmed where the new people or people who put in little money will win for a little bit and then they get you to lose all your money and then try to get you to deposit more money...but also...just cause you watch poker and play poker...it doesn't make you good when you think AA is the best hand...poker just sums up the good plays for the most part and shows you that "oh wow...AA just tripped"...you have to think about probability and odds of what's come up and what hasn't come up yet...it's worked great for me where "horrible" hands like 8-3 off suit and K-3 off suit have paid off greatly.  I went to the casino twice...and brought with me $40 one time and $35 another time to play poker...went home with 800+ each time...would have been 1600+ once but there's always a chance where someone chases and chases and catches a larger full house even though you flopped and bet it...*_*...
