What should I do? Ebay question need help?
Hey I bought something for my dad for his birthday on ebay. I talked to the seller and planned on paying with a money order. It has been over a week since I won the item and I have sent him several emails and have not received a response. His birthday is approaching and I'm not sure what to do. Is there a certain period in which the seller must give you the info to pay? I'm thinking of ordering one from someone else but what would happen with the one I already ordered? Could it be canceled or something since he never contacted me? I am also beginning to wonder if it would even be safe to send him a money order since he has not even responded to me yet. What do you suggest I do?
I haven't gotten his information from him and haven't sent the money order since I don't know where to send it.
Also, I don't have a paypal account
Yeah I am 20

We agreed before I bid that I could pay with a money order and now he is not responding to my emails telling me where to send it. Isn't there a certain time period that he has to tell me were to send it?
also I know that he is active as he keeps listing new items yet he doesn't answer my messages
to harley- that is not an option I just tried

he can have you in breach for not paying
you should have had a paypal account and then you would have been able to pay for it

but how old are you are you of legal age to buy from ebay anyway
go to the auction page , sign in and click "pay now" if the option to pay by money order is there all the seller's details for postage will also be there
