Should i do it or not? HELPPPP!?
OK so this one girl is messaging my sis's ex boyfriend on fb saying stuff about her thats not true. i can get her fb password by just hacking into her yahoo but i wont read any of her messages i just want to see what she sent. i know the answers to her 2 questions when you need to change your password. i wont mesage anyone or do anything on it. Should i do it? Do you think she would know its me or not? do you think she would call the cops or something like that?

do it. life's short. jail is just like vacation anyway.
If you're just looking then I doubt she'll even know.
But to be on the safe side, I'd just confront her.

Answer mine?
