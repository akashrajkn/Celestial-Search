Looking for a new place for music!!!?
I use to use kazaa kuz it had all songs and stuff for free but now it's charging me. Does anyone know of another site where I can download songs for free. Actual songs, not ringtones or anything like that. The actual songs and stuff. Thanx, ten points for best answer!!!!!!!!!!!

limewire, download it from cnet.com
You can use Jamglue.com or Dilandau.com.They are virus free and has a lot of songs.Although they are uploaded by others,4 out of 5 songs can work.Jamglue requires you to have a free account while Dilandau does not need.I hope this can help you...
make it yourself!


i use the Ventones site. just upload and make any ringtone for FREE


http://www.ventones.com

THIS IS THE BEST SITE WITHOUT A DOUBT

step 1 upload a music file
step 2 select what part of the file you want as a ringtone
step 3 they text it straight inside a text message 

totally FREE
With http://searchformusic.eu.pn/ you search more than 80 free, safe, legal music sites (for whole albums, add the word "rapidshare"). That way you can forget about viruses.

Hope this helps. Regards!
