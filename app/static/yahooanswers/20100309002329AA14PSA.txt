on firefox, I accidently got rid of menu bar, address bar, navigation bar  and my favourite sites bar I have?
Any chance to get them back on firefox?

I tried to click right on the mouse but there is nothing!

If you are using PC, try pressing F11
I think you have pressed F11 key accidentally, so they got rid off. Press F11 again. It will come back...
