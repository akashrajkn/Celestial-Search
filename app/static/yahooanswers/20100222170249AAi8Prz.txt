How do I do this "email" thing I hear so often about?
This will sound silly, but someone told me that it's possible to send "mail" through the computer.  I've never heard of such a thing.  How do I do this?  Is there a place to put the postage stamp on the screen or something when I send it?

Thanks a bunch!

it's not possible...
It's just a scam, there is no way to send mail through the internet.
You will have to place it in a box and seal it up, address it. Then call a Courier service.
its not possible......
Here ya go. Email for dummies.
