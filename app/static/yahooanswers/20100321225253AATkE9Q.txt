Can I create a blog at Blogger.com without my gmail contacts knowing?
As you all probably know, Gmail and Blogger are joined.  I'd like to know if my gmail contacts will know/be notified about my Blogger.com blog if I create one.

No, they don't. Only if you decide to either invite them to read your blog or they look up your details themselves to find your blog accounts under that email (but that's largely uncommon unless you have stalker friends) they will not be sent any notification of any new blogs you create.
You can use different email services & it's not mandatory to use Gmail to create a blog you can use yahoo as well.
