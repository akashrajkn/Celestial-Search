Is there a website where you can anonymously post thoughts or experiences?
Sometimes, I feel like sharing my thoughts or experiences with an audience for comment but I want to do it with people who I do not know instead of friends. I thought of starting a blog, but that takes a bit of work and who will ever read it if I don't invite them? I thought of going to a chat room but people there would not want to read long stories of mine - most of them are probably there to flirt or whatever. 
I wonder if anyone knows a website that would suit what I'm looking for?
