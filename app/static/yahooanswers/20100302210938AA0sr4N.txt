I gave a site the wrong email?
I was buying incense on https://glassparadise.3dcartstores.com/ and my dad typed in the wrong email. I need the email to get the code to see if my item shipped but i don't know how. What could i do to change the email so i could get the shipping code?

send the right e mail and tell them the wrong one was sent
