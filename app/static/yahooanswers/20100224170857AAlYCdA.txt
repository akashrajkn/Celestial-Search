How does shadyurl.com work?
Would be cool if someone could tell me how all these links are relatet to the web pages...

It creates a page that does nothing more than redirects you to another page.

They were created because of the need for shorter links in things like twitter.

An example page would contain just the single line of html:
<meta HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" content="0; url=www.yourdomain.com/index.html">
