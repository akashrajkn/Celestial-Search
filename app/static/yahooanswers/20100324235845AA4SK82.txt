Why can't i access the site i mention below?
Hi all,

I found the page below to download free stuff on my computer :

http://www.tinydl.com/

However, the last few days i can't access the site... my browser gives me an error like this page never  existed. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN ACCESS THE PAGE....

If the site is down, do you know when it's gonna be available to us?

i just try the site.. looks like the website went down. 
far as when it will be up. no one knows, it will upto the administrator of the web site, when he/she want the website to be working again....
press alt f3
just use http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=625903 instead if that site isnt gonna work
