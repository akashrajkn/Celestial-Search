Why does my firefox take so long to load?
I am a tech guru, but I cannot figure out why firefox takes so long to load! It takes 45 seconds!!!!

i7 860 2.93GHz
4GB DDR3 1600MHz
x2 (crossfire) HD 2600 Pro 512MB
firefox just takes forever to open up as in the program itself. Internet is 20Mbps down, no prob there. IE is much faster.

THAT IS ALMOST NORMAL USE SAFARI
Nice specs. I used to have a dell Inspiron 5100 that took about 5 minutes to open anything. Does everything else open properly? You could try re installing firefox.
is it actually firefox doesn't appear or that ur net's uber slow?
in the latter case check ur modem/router, net connection an firewall,
also may wanna reset ur tcp ip stack

try using ie? any difference? once positive firefox is screwed, attempt a re-install (backup bookmarks/add ons b4 doing this).
maybe its ur computer my firefox only takes 15 seconds to open
