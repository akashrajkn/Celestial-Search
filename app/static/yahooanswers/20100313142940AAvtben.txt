ps3 web browser help?
how come whenever i go to a website the screen shows weird characters like for example like up on the adress bar it says : 

http://answers.yahoo.com/question/ask;_ylt=AlwJrQ.s5MWm2CUIDQR_iLbj1KIX;_ylv=3 
but on my ps3 it shows this on the screen instead of the yahoo answers page

Example: ?????ylt=AlwJrQ.?????s5MWm??2CUI??DQR_iLbj1KIX;_ylv=3 ????ylt=AlwJrQ.s/???5M??????CUIDQR??_iLbj1K??IX;_yl???v=3 ylt=???AlwJrQ.???s5MWm???2CUIDQR_iLbj???1KIX;_??

NOITCE: all those weird question marks . why does my ps3 not show the web page but shows like a web url but with a BUNCH of question marks and weird characters, some sites work some show that weird url on my screen. like that would be the only thing on my tv screen those weird question marks in a url but all over my screen !

Get rid of your PS3 and buy an Xbox. WAAAAY better.
