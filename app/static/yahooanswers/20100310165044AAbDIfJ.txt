How much is my WoW account worth?
This is my armory http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Nathrezim&cn=Elfbearcat

I have 2 max proffesions
  -Alchemy Elixir master
  -Herbalism

10k Gold (And probably more when I sell my Flask of Endless rage x50 and Flask of the Frost Wyrm x50

It also has a 70 DK on the same server with 3/4 BoA plate gear (for easy leveling)

Epic Flying on the Druid

And a Level 60 Mage

All my toons are on Nathrezim and are all Alliance

You could probably get nothing for it...

You account isn't valuable enough to sell yet
If your trying to sell it try  being silent. You can get yourself banned. 
Id say abt 50$.
You should get one more 80 and good gear for both. Then it will be worth something.
