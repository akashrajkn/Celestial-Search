I CAN'T LOG INTO MY GAIA ACCOUNT!! HALP!!!?
So, I went to log into my account & I entered my username & password. It wouldn't let me in. I did this 7 or more times with my correct password (I put it in exactly correct for them all). So I sent a forgot password thing & when I got into my email, & clicked the link to change the password & it said "Invalid Key!
You are trying to change other user's password? Nice try!"

WTF IS WRONG?! I'm trying to log into my own account!!!

So I went to search for my avatar to see if I've been hacked but it said "The new forum search is a limited release beta. Please try again later when the feature is released ;)."

Is that why I can't log in? (Stupid question. >.<)
Please help people!!!!! T^T

If it matters, I'm Waffles of Darkness. xP
Thank you!
Yeah, that's me.

Your profile is still there but that doesnt mean much. Maybe the site is under maintenance.

Sorry but i had forgotten that even banned accounts remain online.
However if you were banned i think youd get a message telling you so.
This sounds like an error to me.
