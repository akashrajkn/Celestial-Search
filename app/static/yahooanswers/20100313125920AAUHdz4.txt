Google Chrome, Firefox, IE won't open; IE w/ no plugins opens?
I am currently using IE with no plugins to ask this question. Two days ago I accidentally downloaded a file that had a malware attached to it. Immediately I used Thinkvantage's system restore and restored my computer to its previous setting (before I got the malware)

Now, however, Chrome, firefox, and IE won't open. When IE opens it immediately shuts down - IE w/o plugins is the only thing that can access the internet right now.

What do I do?

You have a virus. Do a virus scan.
Nuke it with the system restore disk.
Next time, before you get on the web, use a sandbox application such as Sandboxie or Comodo.

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.
go to control panel uninstall a program  and repair every one of them.
get avast 5.0 http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download do a full virus scan
get SB S&D http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html update and imunize and check for problems
