How long do deleted e-mail stay in the trash/deleted e-mails folder on Hotmail and Yahoo Mail?
I think on Yahoo Mail it might actually tell you somewhere how long the e-mails stay in trash before they are gone for good. I think it's like 30 days. Does that sound right? I can't find anything on Hotmail that tells you.

Thats a interesting question i can find emails in my gmail trash that is 2 years old about as long as i had gmail.
