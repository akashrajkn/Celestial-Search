Only Internet Explorer will connect to the internet?
For some strange reason only Internet Explorer will connect to the internet.

Firefox, Chrome, Limewire ect all tell me that I dont have an internet connection.

Ive turned of my firewall and I dont use a proxy.....Please Help!!!!
All other browers are running online but not connecting......and ive uninstalled and reinstalled everything.

Run antivirus and check firefox from the file tab in the top left hand corner and make sure you arent "working offline"
Try redownloading firefox w/ the new version
did you at least blocked your firefox.re-move chrome,and limewire,etcsee if you can do a versus can?  turn your computer completely off,than back-on again,alot of times when you do this ,will work better?might also be because of the versus protection you were having causing the problems.chec for up-dates?do a system check-up. good luck?
