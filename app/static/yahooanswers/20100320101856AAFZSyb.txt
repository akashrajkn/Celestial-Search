How can I make my Webkinz happy when it is down to 35 and lower, but appetite and health is full?
I have had a Webkinz account since 2007 and I stopped in June 2009, but went back to it again about 2 weeks ago. Their health and appetite are mostly full, but I can't figure out how to make them happy! Help?

what i do to make them happy is I play tons and tons of games!
after a while they should get hungry and then feed them their favorite food or a special recipe (you can find all of them at www.webkinzinsider.com)

another thing to make them happy is to click on "travel agency" under the things to do menu on the right and send all of them to the spa. that might cost a lot but it takes under a minute.
If everything else is full, all you need to do play with, buy it things or do the daily tasks. Just being on Webkinz and playing with them, makes your Webkinz happier. Don't worry, it will eventually go up, but for now, just remember to always put him/her to bed and always feed it and play with it. Try buying it a trip somewhere (he he, buy their happiness).

I hope this helps! Enjoy your Webkinz!
