What are some good dating sites in the UK to find a middle class or proffessional man?
Not Sugardaddie, mysinglefriend or match.com..... Or guardian soulmates.... I tried them all and didnt like..
Im looking for someone on my wavelength and live in London

Gold-digger .com
Bag a rich guys .com
I'am init for the money honey .com
I don't think many professional men need to go onto websites.  There are predatory females just waiting and ready to pounce.
TV adverts would have you believe eHarmony
http://www.eharmony.co.uk/

or Match.com
http://uk.match.com/

Alot of these "dating" sites are nothing but money-hungry scammers who pretend to have "matches" but dont have any.  A few actually have matches... but the people never want to meet-up or are not actually single.

I'd suggest going to a training course or hanging out in areas/galleries, etc that you like though... a social life is a much more fun way of finding someone ;o)
Bemoresocial.com..
www.pof.com

I met and married my man on there and he fits your category
OzAdz - the best dating website for Londoners by far!
mydiscreteplace.com - You could find lot of people from UK.
I recommend wealthychats.com. It's a nice dating club. And I've chatted with many nice UK singles there before. But I didn't date them due to the long distance problems.
