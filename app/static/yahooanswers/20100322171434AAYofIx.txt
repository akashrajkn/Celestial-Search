Why does Chatroulette look like this?

Whenever I go on, it looks like this, and when I connect to my camera it's really slow and glitchy. Even after I restarted the computer several times.

just click allow, it just agrees that you wanna sign in to it
Sorry for my english... I'm French.

1) They upgraded the website.

2) It was hacked 48 hours ago

3) it's very very slow for everyone, today.

4) I hope you don't go on Chatroulette to pleasure yourself !!!
