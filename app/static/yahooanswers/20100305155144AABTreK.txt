What is the appeal of "Chat Roulettte"?
I don't se why people are getting so into it. What's the point?

Cuz it's random and funny you never know what you're going to get lol.


Um is this a new site? Cuz I never heard of it until a few days ago and you're the second person I've heard it from
apparently people enjoy watching fat guys jerk off in front of a camera
u can make new friends and stuff or just make people mad for fun
Hahah I love Chat roulette and other site like it. It's fun when you are just messing around on there because you will never see those people again unless you get connected to them again.
It's funny in a gross way.
But honestly, I'm never going on it again. Lol.
It is a time waster.

Chat Roulette has the same appeal of Facebook, except it is more spontaneous and random.
The internet has finally reached the point where there are too many choices of what to go do, so people are using Chat Roulette to take the choice away from them and connect to a random source of possible entertainment.
