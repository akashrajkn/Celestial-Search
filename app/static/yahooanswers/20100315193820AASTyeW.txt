ping some numerical IP address and see if works. 

eg: ping 66.249.91.104

If it works, you just need to fix your nameserver addresses. You most likely made a typographical error when entering them or something. Or maybe you have DHCP enabled in your OS but turned off in your router or something trivial like that.
download Firefox. it is much better than explorer and its free, and much more user friendly, u can customize it however you want.

Try to restore your computer back before it happened. If all fails use your software to reboot. If you delete that file it will cost you about $125 to buy it at Office Max, etc because its not a free down load
