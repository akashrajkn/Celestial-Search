Make Money Submitting Articles?
Okay, well I have made some extra money writing for associated content, but I was wondering what other sites will pay you upfront for submitting an article. Does anyone know of any good sites out there? The performance payments dont bother me (ppv) but the site definately needs to pay upfront. Thanks!

Long ago I downloaded this book about article marketing secrets. It has mentioned a list of websites that you may have interest in.

It also mentioned step by step instructions on how a specific website works and what you should do to get maximum payout.

The author is giving away this book free. Get it if you want it.
