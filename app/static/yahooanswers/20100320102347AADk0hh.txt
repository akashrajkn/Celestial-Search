Is anyone else having trouble with Deviantart.com ?
For most pages it takes so long and does not show picture.
Does anyone know why ?

The server's down apparently.  Seems I'm not the only one who can't access it either.  It's just showing a blank screen.

It's on dA's end.  Wouldn't be too surprised if they crashed their own site tacking on more annoying "updated features". :b

Just gotta wait it out, I guess.
Yeh, same here. I dunno why; I guess it's just maintenance or something?
They typically get these things fixed soon enough though. lol
