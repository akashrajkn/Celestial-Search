Is there a site you can advertise stuff what are up for bidding free?
Without using a credit card?

Like eBay But a Free versoin
I'm in the UK and want to be selling a Mobile Phone and Disc's

yes but depends what your selling.
Some sites are restricted to certain categories they allow. Ask the question again but add what you want to sell so you gain more help.
If you're in Canada Kijiji.ca, the US Craigslist
If you dont want to use your credit card sites like ebay, try free classified site, its good way to sell stuff.
