Quick Need A New Working Proxy?

I would spend more time doing my work and less time looking for proxies if the school didn't block sites in the first place...all i wanna do is check craigs list for 5 minutes .

You need to use school computers for what they are there for, school work!
((( surfxmatic.info ))) is the best unblock site ( for me and for all my friends ) that include a large list of fast, free, new, and working proxies that up to date every 30 minutes , you can using it to bypass your school filter, access and unblock all blocked websites ( i believe that : Surf X Matic is smarter than any smart web filter )

Good surfing
where is my vote ?

Cheers...;)

Web filters get more sophisticated every day. They can scan and detect proxies as soon as you try to use them. The most advanced systems can block you within seconds. Others send a report to the admin and the block is done manually.

The name of the proxy, how new it is, whether it¡¯s https or not does not matter. The proxy will be detected and blocked because it¡¯s a proxy.

There is also considerable risk in using free proxies from unknown sources. Many of these free proxies are what are called hacker pots. They are there waiting for you to fall into their trap so they can steal your information and plant bots on your computer. Once a bot is planted the hacker has control of your machine and can steal credit cards, attack web sites and send out tons of spam all from your IP address.

Some of the free proxies/vpn's are run by people out to make money. There is nothing wrong with that in principle. However the best case here is that you will get a proxy loaded with advertisements with no real speed to it. The amount of money the owner can make with advertising clicks is really only pennies. Many of these owners supplement their income by key logging everything you do and selling your personal information to advertising companies. Since you have no way to know what the owner is actually doing you need to assume the worst case is true.
