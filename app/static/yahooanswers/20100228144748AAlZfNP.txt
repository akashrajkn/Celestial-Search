Is webstarts.com a safe website?
I want to make my own website, and thought about using webtarts.com.  First, is it safe?  They won't steal my personal information will they? And can i make my own url?  It won't have any add-ons will it?  For instance: example.webstarts.com  I DON'T WANT THAT!!! All i want would be example.com   Can i do that on webstarts.com?  If not, can someone tell me a free site that i can?
Neil   Will I have my own URL if i use that site?

if you want to make your own website then freewebs.com is better.
