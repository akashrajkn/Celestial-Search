I ordered an item from amazon and chose one day shipping and it says it wont be here til a month?
Ok so last night I ordered an airsoft gun and selected the one day shipping yet the estimated time delivery said it wont get to my house until April 22nd! I already payed like 15 bucks for one day shipping how is this fair?

Contact Amazon support.  The item is obviously not in stock
1-day shipping is a bit deceiving.  Although they WILL ship the item that fast, it may not be available to BE shipped for weeks.  I would follow the advice of the previous responder.  Contact Customer Support and cancel the order.

I no longer use Amazon
