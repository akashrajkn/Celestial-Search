What's better: Justhost.com or  siteground.com?
I would like to start up a e-commerce website at a low price per months. In terms of features etc which is better: 

justhost.com or siteground.com

The major difference I think is that siteground allowes you to accept debit cards free while justhost you need to pay for. 

or is there better ones?

Thanks :)
