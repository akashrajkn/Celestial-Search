Firefox Add-on Manager?
Is there an add-on for Firefox that manages your other add-ons? I searched google for nearly an hour looking for one, but I could not find anything. Also, I tried to find the mozilla page that lists all the add-ons for firefox by categories and such, to see if I could find it there, but I couldn't find that either.

Links for one or both appreciated.
I already knew about that box. But I can't ever find it. I know there is an add-on which adds a shortcut to that little box onto a toolbar at the top of the screen, which was what I was looking for...

Firefox provides its own add-on management. It's quite capable and being improved, too. Follow the links from this online discussion:

Wanting something - unneeded?

Good luck!

Additional info:
ALT-T A brings up the tools menu. So does clicking Tools | Add-ons.

Too many added buttons or icons clutters up a program window or the desktop IMHO. Just remember "ta".
