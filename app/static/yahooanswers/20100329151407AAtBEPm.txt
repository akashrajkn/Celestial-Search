What site is best for personal journaling/blogging/diary-keeping?
I'm looking for a really good personal blogging website. I've tried a few so far...

* Xanga
* Livejournal
* Wordpress
* Blogger

None of them are really to my liking. So far, Xanga is my favorite due to its extensive customization abilities.

I'm not in it for profit or socializing or networking. I'm looking for the MOST SECURE and MOST CUSTOMIZABLE blog I can find. I'm one of those people who's always afraid someone's going to somehow stumble upon their online diary and ruin their lives with it...so, I want the absolute most secure, private one I can get. (And I'm willing to bet there's a lot of you who will suggest simply not blogging online if I want it that private -- but, the thing is, I want to be able to access it and write from anywhere. So, no, I don't want to blog in Microsoft Word or Notepad or anything like that. It's got to be something I can access from different computers.)

Any ideas?

You could always make your own website, if you want it to be private.

You'd have to pay for it if you want it to be truly secure though.
