Please Help Me With Lockerz.com ?!?
This message appears when I create a account: 
Thanks for your interest!
Please have some patience.

We're pretty dang popular, so it might take us a little time to get back to you. We promise it will be worth the wait.

What do I do when this appears?Do I wait on the webpage or wait for an email or...???

Lockerz isn't good, I've tried it and never received anything. They're probably not taking any new members at the moment, unless you get invited.

This is a much more reliable site. There are always Mods available in the chatbox if you need any help:

The second I got that message I got an email from Lockerz inviting me, so I have no idea wtf everyone asks for invitations for.

Either way Lockerz sucks. Swagbucks is so much better. Swagbucks always has their items in stock and you can redeem points whenever you want. With Lockerz they have unannounced times where they restock their merchandise and everything is gone within seconds......and they only do it once a month.
you can sign up if sum1 sends u an invitation.
Give me ur email i ll send u the invitation.
Lockerz has been proven to be a scam. I would avoid it. However, signing up for an account can take weeks. It is far quicker to be invited, there are plenty of Lockerz threads on forums around the internet asking and supplying invitations.
