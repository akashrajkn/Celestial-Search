Can you have two wireless modems with one provider?
Well what I want to know is that is it possible for me to order another Verizon FiOS modem? My parents already have the internet set up in my house but the connection in my room is really low and things are kind of slow. Is there anyway i can set up another modem in my room? Or would i have pay for that monthly? I mean for some reason i think it would be extra on their bill but i am not sure. And i mean if it is then i'll settle for the slowness! Lol


If anyone can help or has any questions if they don't understand the question, let me know?
James: Would one for a little under $40 be just as good? Or does quality matter?

You can have as many WIRELESS AXESS POINTS as you like, but you can only have 1 MODEM. You might try HomePlug, google it and see for yourself :)
you would be better off buying a signal  booster or a antenna for your comp then getting a new  modem. Should be able to get one for less then $40 that will work wonders for you
