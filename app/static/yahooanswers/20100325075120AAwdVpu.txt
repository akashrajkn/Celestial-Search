Can I claim postage costs back from Amazon?
I ordered a new camera on Saturday and opted for 1st class postage as it said it should come within 1-2 days. Amazon said that it should have been delivered by the 23rd, which then changed to the 24th, but it still hasn't arrived today.

I realise that this is not Amazons fault as the Royal Mail is fairly awful at times! But I was just wondering if there was any way to claim back the extra postage I paid as I may as well have opted for Super Saver Delivery?

The main reason I chose to pay more for postage in the hope it would get here on time is because I needed the camera for Friday, and also because I'm going home for a month on Sunday and it's a 2 hour journey back to uni. (Again I realise I did this at my own risk and am not faulting Amazon).

I don't think you can but if it's any concellation, I think you should be allowed to. You should at all times get what you pay for and you may not require the item, if it comes late and you are forced to buy a new one.

Contact the Royal Mail and explain the situation. See what they'll do and if it doesn't work, complain.
