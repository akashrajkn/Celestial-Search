The iPad doesn't have CoverFlow!?
See this picture-- http://twitpic.com/1bmn9m

I really wanted to see CoverFlow on the iPad since I didn't see it in the introduction. What is Apple doing!?!!?

Nope. Considering how big the screen is (1024x768), using Cover Flow would pixelate your album art like crazy. Album art is usually 500x500.
Dont get a ipad it's just a giant itouch. There's a new device coming out called the Adam made by Notion Ink. It really is amazing and it completely blows away the ipad. See for yourself:

AND NO

I don't work for them and I'm not a spammer. I just happen to think this is an amazing product which deserves a million times more attention than that POS ipad.
