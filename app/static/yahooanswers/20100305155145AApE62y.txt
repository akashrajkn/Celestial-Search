Why won't my wireless internet work on my laptop but it will on my sisters?
Earlier it was her laptop that wasn't connecting to the wireless but now it is mine. This happened about 2 months ago and I called netgear and they fixed it and so I called again but they said I only had one free call? and told me to buy a new one EVEN THOUGH it can be fixed. Pleeeease does anyone know how to get my laptop connected to wireless?
It says wireless networks are available and when I go to click on netgear to connect it says windows cannot connect to netgear
the model is RANGEMAX WIRELESS ROUTER
WPN824

Gonna need more info. Whats the laptop saying? Does it see the router or wont it connect? Details....
i think its because she's hotter than you. the internet knows these things somehow.
netgear model #?
error message?
