Lockerz.com?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I have to questions about lockerz.com
well i know they're real cuz i got my ipod touch last week

but my question is, how to earn more ptz besides watchin vids and login in and doin the dailes?

and the second question is, do you want a lockerz invite? if u do, say i do
wen u say i do,
include ur email

i dont think is any other way to earn pointz unless you hack your account
well lockerz is on beta mode...so there's not much to do but invite friends,watch vids,logging in and answer dailies to get ptz.
if you're a z-lister then you can earn double the points
&congratz on getting the ipod
That's it for now but their adding games soon enough which will allow more points.
those are the only ways tht they have as of now
