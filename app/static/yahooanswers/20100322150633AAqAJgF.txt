What's "Blue waffle"?
One of my friends in the dorm at college just sent the link to me, and it says "The Blue waffle". I'm thinking it's a recipe to blueberry waffles, but I want to make sure it's not something else (Last time, I got the link to "Two girls One cup" YUCK!). And I refuse to type it in on google.

I'm very curious, I want to open it but it might be a virus or something I don't want to see. What is it before I open it?

dont look at it. its a gross infection of the female genitalia. trust me, its disgusting.
It is very gross, i advise you not to open it. (however not quite as bad as 2 girls 1 cup, but then again how can you rate things this gross)
