How do I send in pictures to Walmart online, and pick them up in the store?
I have pictures on my computer that I no longer have on a memory card, and I need to print them off. Is there anyway I could upload the pictures to walmart.com and then pick them up in a store near me? Thank you!

go to www.walmart.com and go to the photo section, register, upload you images choose a location for pick up and your all set.
