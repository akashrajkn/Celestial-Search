Firefox Memory Usage a little bit high?
this just started about 10 minutes ago. my firefox just got slower. alot slower. I go on chatroulette just for shits and giggles but it uses at least 100% of my computer usage via Taskbar manager and use as much RAM as it could, i have 2gb of ram and it got to about 1,500,000 K's! Then i just had to end process.

its just when i go on chatroulette it just takes up THIS MUCH MEMORY

is it firefox? or is it chatroulette itself, or is it my ISP?

Hi, and sorry for my bad english (I'm French).
No, it's not because of firefox... Chatroulette is running slow for everyone on earth today : they are upgrading the website. As you might have noticed, if you were connected today, it's glitchy too.

bye bye.
