idk and the thing is the person says that they injected the cat with transparent liquid.... when i had to put my dog to sleep and im pretty sure when i had to put my guinea pig to sleep it was pink.

and if this is real i hope this person goes to hell.
well idk.. because if you click the tab "pictures" the cat's nose is different color than the cat under the tab "fuzzy's demise" soooo.... what do you think
and the spots in the dead cat goes all the way up the sides of the cat and the cat under the tab "pictures" does not have spots what so ever... so im going to go with no now that i think about it... hbu and reasons plz (sorry i keep adding things)
