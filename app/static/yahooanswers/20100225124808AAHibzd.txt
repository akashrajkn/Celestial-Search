Help with Internet explorer?
Hey guys, I was typing something in with alt + number pad then all of a sudden the window changed, now there is nothing on the screen unless I move my  mouse to the top of the screen then the bar will come down. Any way to fix that?

It Might be that u have pressed ALT+Minus sign (-) ...This combination of keys toggle windows console or can edit the display settings...

You activated the full screen mode. Either try right clicking on the bar and pressing exit full screen mode or press F11 or something.
