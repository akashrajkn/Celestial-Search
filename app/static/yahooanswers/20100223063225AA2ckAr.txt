I have a question, about twitter!?
i have a question.. ok so everybody who's using twitter know the "@username" right?

only my followers will see my tweets right?

but if i put @username and the username is someone whom IM following, but he/she is not following me! would he/she see my tweet?? 
i mean, his username is in my tweet. SO WOULD HE/SHE SEE IT? 

PLEASE ANSWER!

If your tweets are public, then everybody can see it, example my user name is "manups"
my tweets are public and everybody can view http://twitter.com/manups
you are not following me right now, ok. and i.m also not following you, but you can tweet me using @manups <your message>



An @reply is a public message sent from one person to another, distinguished from normal updates by the @username prefix. If a message begins with @username, we collect it as a reply. Reply publicly to any update on Twitter by using the @username format. Following is not necessary to reply to someone, and all of your replies are visible in the @username tab in your home page sidebar. (Tweets with @username elsewhere in the tweet are also collected in your sidebar tab; tweets starting with @username are replies, and tweets with @username elsewhere are considered mentions.) Please note that if your account is private, users who are not following you will not see your @replies or mentions.
Yes. I believe so.
Sorry.
Maybe there might be a setting where you
can change your privacy settings. :]
