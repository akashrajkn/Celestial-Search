Are There Any Kids Websites Where You Can An Avatar?
I like websites where you can create an avatar and chat with other people around the world. Something like Club Penguin, Super Secret, but it has to be free and you can't download it. I have searched everywhere and nothing. :( Plus I already know Kidzworld i can't get on it because it gives you viruses. :( PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!
