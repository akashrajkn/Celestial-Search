What is the name of this website?
Around 6 months ago I remember there was a website either featured on the TV or in a magazine where people upload clips of themselves moving from the left of the screen to the right of the screen.
The website owner has joined all of the clips together to make a neverending video that plays on the main page of the site.
Does anyone know which website it is?
Many thanks.
