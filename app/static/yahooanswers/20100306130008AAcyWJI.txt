like i want to buy something off ebay and its ending soon. so if i make a paypall account now, will i be able to make the payment on ebay as soon as i make it?

Yes, but the seller may hesitate to sell to someone who created an account minutes earlier.

Paypal will not be able to "verify" your account on short notice like that, either. They contact the bank to find out if the info matches.

It would be better to have a friend with an established account do it for you.
Check with Paypal website and see what their requirements are. Usually, they need a Bank Account verified, to use, so that will take some time before they get it approved. 

But like I said, check directly with them.
