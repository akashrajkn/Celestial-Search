Will it slow internet connection down if i bought another modem and connected it to another phoneline?
I want to hook up another modem in another room to try and speed up my internet connection on my Play Station 3, will be what it is for also.

You need a router not another modem. Also adding a second modem at  the what ever location to be close to what ever you seek will not speed up the net.
It sounds like you are using a DSL connection. DSL does not work the same way that dial-up worked... you can not have two modems in the same house unless you have a special business account with your service provider.

And on that note.... the reason you have a slow connection is because you are on DSL - it was never made for gaming. Try upgrading your Internet service to cable or fiber.
