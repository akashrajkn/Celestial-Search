How do you decide which categories of y/a your going to answer?

I dont need help deciding people. i thought this was a fun question ! i posted it 3x. grrrr

Depends what you know. Really you should only answer questions that you know the answer to.
usually stick to games and programming but I answer any question I see that I think I can answer.
If you want to be a top contributer you should stick to one topic but I different topics and variety of questions. So it's what ever you want.
Hope this helps.
I normally stick to computers and internet, mainly security..cause thats what I do... but sometimes, just sometimes... I'll see a question that just begs for me to troll them, and I can't resist. When I get the call, I'll go to whatever category I have to in order to get the lulz.
