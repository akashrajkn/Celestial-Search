How can one verify their account on twitter? what does verification actually means on twitter?
I've seen only celebrities account are verified on twitter..what does that mean? and how do they verify?
Please give me the link to verify it. Thanks

may be my guess is by mobile sms confirmation.
verify account means we¡¯ve been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved. (This does not mean we have verified who, exactly, is writing the tweets.)
