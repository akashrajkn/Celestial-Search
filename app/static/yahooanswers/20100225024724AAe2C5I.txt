who can help me with this?
Okay i have a yahoo e-mail address but i have been getting a lot of spams and things that i don't really want to look at how can i cancel my e-mail address to sign up for another one? i don't want to continue using this address but i also don't want to keep it open how can i cancel it close it and never use it again.

You can create a new account, configure your email software for that account, then remove the old one from your account options.

You may be better off not deleting the old one (not sure how to!), as inevitably there's always a site somewhere that you signed up to using that address, and will need to change it before you get rid of it.
