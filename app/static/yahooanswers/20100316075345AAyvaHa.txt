New website that is selling name brand electronics at very low prices, need alot of traffic?
Brand new website, it is very professional. Sells brand name electronics, Plasma tvs, Ipods, Iphones, Blackberrys, Laptops etc. Extremely low prices. Need alot of targeted quick traffic. Good quality traffic. This isnt some blog site or news article, its a simple online store that is like more than 60% off retail price. Just let me know about any reasonably priced traffic programs that start right away or free. Let me know . No stupid answers please. Thanks ahead of time.

You could add your site to Google Webmasters.
Try trading links with other people you know that create web sites, to draw traffic from their web site.
