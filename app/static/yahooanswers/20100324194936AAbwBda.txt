will this actually do anything or is it like people are saying "its just scare tactics"

It's not a scare tactic. It's true. The government will actually convict you of being guilty of pirating software before they get their hands on any evidence. You know why? because so many people do it anyway!
The government just thinks that it's just not appropriate to the public/community, so yea..
