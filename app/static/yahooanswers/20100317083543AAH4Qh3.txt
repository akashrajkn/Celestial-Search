Im Not Getting My $5 Amazon Code from Swagbucks  help?
I ordered a $5 amazon card from Swagbucks on 3/5/10 and i still havent gotten the code yet!  Please Help me

lol, $5 gift card for an online store?????
you will not be able to buy anything on the internet with a gift card?
They send out gift card codes via email every 1st and 17th of the month. You should get it today or tomorrow for sure!
yeah, what the person above me said. When you order a gift card they release the codes on a certain date of each month (the 1st and 17th, but i think it used to be the 30th and 16th so maybe thats y u got confused). I got my codes just today, so check your email.
