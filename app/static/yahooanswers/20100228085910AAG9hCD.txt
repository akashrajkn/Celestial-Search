question about lockerz?
has anyone got the ipod touch 8 gb from lockerz yet? im saving up for it and i wanted to know what generation it is. Also, does it come with the built in wifi? and has anyone ordered one and not recieved it?

Just so you know its very hard to get a prize from Lockerz. They only have a redemption about once a month that lasts for 30min. And you have no clue when itll happen. 

And just a suggestion- Look into signing up at swagbucks. You can can earn points to buy amazon gift cards and buy the ipod touch through amazon. Itll be much easier.  http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee
