is swoopo.com a scam? (10 points)?
I recently found this website called swoopo.com. is it a scam or not?

Swoopo is not a scam.  If Swoopo is a scam then so is the lottery.  You pay for bids and try to win big savings with those bids (same concept as the lottery).  However, with Swoopo you at least have some degree of control.  I would recommend finding a similar, but less popular, website that is just starting out.   If you do that then you have less users to compete with.  Which means lower prices and using less bids.  Smartbargainhunters.com is relatively new and has far fewer users than Swoopo.  You can usually win without ever using  more than 100 bids on one product. 100 bids is equivalent to $60 and most of the products are worth at least twice that.
