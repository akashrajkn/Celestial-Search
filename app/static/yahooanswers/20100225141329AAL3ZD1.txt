Is there any way to become a ChaCha guide without living in the states?
Live in Ireland if thats any use. Seems like a cool idea, especially since im in college and have very little time to get any money any other way.

you wont have time to be a chacha guide while in college
you will have time while your in college i asked them before what do you do for a living and most of them said they were in college. you can log in whenever you want for as long as you want. heres a link if this helps.
