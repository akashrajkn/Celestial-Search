What's the best way to stylize a ComicPress installation for my webcomic?
I am attempting to revolutionize the Internet (with a revolutionary new webcomic) and have stumbled into a most unfortunate barrier. Apparently "ComicPress" is not so plug-and-play, user-friendly, easy-to-use as it is advertised to be.

Upon installing ComicPress (an arduous task I shan't bore you with the details of) I have discovered that I lack the knowledge to customize it beyond the predetermined themes. Perhaps I have missed the option available for such a task. Regardless, I require help, and have come to Yahoo! Answers in hopes of receiving at least some insight into this conundrum of coding.

I think I should be able to style a ComicPress install without having to learn an entirely new language. That's ridiculous. Millions of people have websites, and I doubt all of them are expert programmers.

Try ComicPress 2.5 it's the Windows XP of the ComicPress versions with everything after being the Vista versions of ComicPress.  They're supposedly coming out with a ComicPress 3.0 which the webcomic community is hoping will be the Windows 7 version of ComicPress.

ComicPress 2.5 is fairly easy to customize with lots of tutorials online and documentation IN the files.  I don't know of anyone who's had an easy time adapting the newer versions of ComicPress.
