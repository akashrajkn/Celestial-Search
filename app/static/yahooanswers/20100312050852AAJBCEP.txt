Is there any way that I could download a book for free?
I'm sure there are illegal ways to do it just like downloading music but I don't know the actual site to do it. And I don't want a virus so it should be a trusted site that many have used. I'd like to have it in PDF form.

Project Gutenberg.
Thousands of book texts all passed out of copyright, all free to download.

Cheers.
