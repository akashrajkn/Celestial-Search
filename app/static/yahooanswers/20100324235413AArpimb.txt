1: I have a Demonoid account and there were times I went months without using it.
2: Mine is 1.47, and I am not banned. No idea what that means though.
3: I doubt it.
4: No answer.

Sorry I can't help completely..
I also have an account at Demonoid and they won't ban you for the first 2. If you want to get an account then just go on there on the weekend and there's a chance that you'll be able to get an account.
