UK - Is it true that Talk Talk now own Plusnet?
A salesmen is trying to get me to switch ISP's and reckons I wont get charged for breaking my contract because Talk Talk now own Plusnet.  I have tried searching on-line but cant find any reference to this.

Do Carphone warehouse own Plusnet??  If so then they also own Talk Talk.
I haven't heard anything about BT selling  Plusnet to Talk Talk , probably he is at it ....If you are with Plusnet then why would he want you to change to Talk Talk if they own Plusnet ? Disnae make sense
careful! my husband works for talk talk, they are informed by email of all the news regarding the company and this is news to him.
