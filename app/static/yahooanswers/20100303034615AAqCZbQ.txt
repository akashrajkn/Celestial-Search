Help! My Internet font is tiny I can't read anything. How to fix this?
i can barely read this

Try holding down CTRL and scrolling the mousewheel. 

Or try holding CTRL and pressing + or -
Go to view. There should be a Font or Text or something you can change. If anything, Change the zoom.
You know the wheel in the middle of your mouse?
Well hold control (Ctrl) and push the wheel up.
hold down the ctrl key while rolling the center wheel up on your mouse.
Hold your "Ctrl" key and scroll upwards on your mouse.
Press Ctrl , Shift and +
lol :)

Hold the ctrl button and press +; or hold the ctrl button and scroll the mouse wheel :)
HOLD "CTRL" and "0" Default
HOLD "CTRL" and "+" Make bigger
HOLD "CTRL" and "-" Make smaller

Holding Control and using your scroll wheel will also do it (which is probably how your text got so small)
There are a couple of ways, but the easy way is ~ In the bottom right corner is the zoom level. Click the small triangle to change.
in Internet Explorer:
Go to view >zoom >choose 100%
in Firefox:
Go to view >zoom >Reset

it should set the page back to the original font size.
right click on an empty spot on you desktop, click on properties, click on appearance , click on fort size, change it to large!!!!

if this doesn't work maybe its in your graphics settings

if nothing works set your computer to an previous  time ( that day before the problem started) and it will reset your computer settings to that date (save all needed work and documents)

hope this helps, free to give me best answer if you want
