Are there any free dating sites in the UK where you can email for free?
I hate it when you spend ages registering only to find joining is free but you've got to pay to message someone

thats how they can run the website. sorry.
Try these 100% totally free sites as they are more or less strictly UK, compared to other sites that are based in USA or include majority of members from other parts of the world. But I think for UK locality the Plentyoffish site has a better selection, although Connectinsingles has much more fun stuff to do other than just look for a date.
OzAdz - no sign up needed either.
