How do i use a bluetooth widget ?
i want to text my friend but i don't have a cell so i want to text my friend on the interwebs so   can you tell me how to use it ?

its very easy to text using your pc its a simple as getting the phones email address use your yahoo messenger you will need the full phone address it will look something like this 123-456-7890@verizon.com. if you do not know the phones address simply send an email from the phone to your email and you will then have the phones address, as far as bluetooth goes it only works over a very short distance usually only in the same room.
hope this helps.
