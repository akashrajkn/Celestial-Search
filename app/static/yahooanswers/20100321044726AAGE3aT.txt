firefox drop down bar too big?
i just downloaded firefox 6, the drop down bar is huge...for example if it is google.com it says this:

Google
hhtp://www.google.com


but in big probably size 16 letters.......i like the old style like internet explorer has where it will just say www.google.com in maybe size 12 letters

i hate this new firefox...any idea how to change it?

I dont use firefox bar. You might look under tools opt settings. Ihave firefox and only use google. I deleted the rest
go to tools then options go to content, in the second box down there are the font settings
