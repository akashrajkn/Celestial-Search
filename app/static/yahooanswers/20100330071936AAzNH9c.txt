WHAT HAPPENED TO FORMSPRING?!?!?!?!?!?
Go to formspring.com
It says select which company you want, formstack or formspring, because I guess this company named Formstack bought the domain "formspring.com"
Then when you click on Formspring, it has a 404 error, and when you do formspring.com/namehere it goes to Formstack and when you go to formspring.me/namehere it says error 404!!!!
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE HELP
formspring.me is giving me a 404 error
and you used to be able to do formspring.com and be transferred to formspring.me i'm not stupid

it works fine for me... o_O
you're typing it wrong. D:
haha, i was confused too at first.
and then i typed in formspring.com
poor formstack, they must be heartbroken to have been misread so much. xP

edit: im aware you're not dumb. :/ you didnt have to put it so crudely. 
when i pressed on formspring.me, it still worked perfectly fine, be sure you are typing your name correctly.
other than that, im not sure..? D:
nope still works for me o,o
its formspring.me
It's formspring.me...

not formspring.com
its formspring.me not .com =) just gor to formspring.me and sign in the regular way
the same thing happened to me !
it wont load. 
i dont get it. it keeps mentioning formstack?
wtf.
.______.
