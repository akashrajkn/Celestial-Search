help for paying on ebay?
hi, after i have bid on an item, and lets say i won the auction, how do i pay for it? as in where do i go?

Open a PayPal account, details available on E-Bay.
Paypal.....
check the paying options of ur bid item

if u have a credit card, i think u can use paypal account for paying

google about paypal for more details

if ur internet facility is not so secured use of credit card directly is dangerous
If you just click on pay for item won it will guide you through it. You will have the option to pay as guest with a card, or  you can pay with paypal. When you choose to pay with paypal it will give you the option to open an account. When you open an account, paypal will make 2 deposites into the account you use. You will have to find out what those 2 deposites are and finish setting up the account. However, as guest you can pay imediately.
