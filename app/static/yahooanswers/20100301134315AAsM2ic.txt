What if I just don't pay for something on eBay?
I accidentally bid on something and I'll probably be the winner. Is there any ways to withdraw from bidding on the item? What would happen if I just don't pay for it? I'm not sure what to do...

ur screwed lol
My only advise is to talk to the seller and explain the situation if you win.
You've signed a contract to buy the item.  You're on the line.

You can try to contact the seller and ask for forgiveness, but they can still demand that you pay.
