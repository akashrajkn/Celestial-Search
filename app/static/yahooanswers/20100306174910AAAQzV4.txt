Is it free to call from Skype to cell phone with unlimited internet?
I have unlimited internet with Bigpond which means it's the same amount of money a month. But when I was on Skype I accidentally called someone on to their phone and that isn't free. Will it cost me more money even though I've got unlimited?

Apparently not.

I believe its only "free" if you've calling another skype user. If you try to contact someone NOT using skype when you call them, that you'll be charged for it.
