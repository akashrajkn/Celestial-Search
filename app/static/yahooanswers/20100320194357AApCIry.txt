Is a camera required for Chatroulette?
I was using chatroulette a lot about a week ago, and then I stopped because I started getting all sorts of disgusting partners so I just quit.. but when I tried to go back on it today, there was no choice of checking whether or not to send my video.  There's still a box to check for audio, but there used to be one for video too!

Has this happened to anyone else? I don't usually send video when I use chatroulette just to be safe, so if I am required to send video I think I'll have to stop using it. :/

Thanks!

You do NOT have to be on camera ive done it (:
I don't think you have to..
I've gone on many times without
(I don't want random creeps seeing me)
but maybe it's changed..
you can still go on chatroulette if you dont want people to see you...just google and download manycam its free and works pretty well..then go to sources then blank image... if you dont feel like downloading manycam you can go to www.omegle.com where the webcams arent required
