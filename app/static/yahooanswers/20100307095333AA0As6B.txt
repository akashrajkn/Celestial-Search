Where can I get LOTR ringtones for my bf's cell COMPLETELY FREE no gimmics?
I do not want to pay anything for this.  Must be free.  Please give me a web address.  Don't just say, "Go here...", with no http lead.  It can be any song from Lord of The Rings.  I CANNOT DOWNLOAD TO A PC THEN UPLOAD TO HIS PHONE, I do not have the right cable for this.  I really need to use a company that will send it to his phone.  NO SHADY COMPANIES PLEASE.  Someone laggit that will not sell his phone number for profits.  Any help here?
