if you are transferring money to paypal then you order something will it come off the money being transferred?
I was looking around on the internet and i found something i wanted to buy. After i had started to transfer money into my paypal account. I was wondering and hoping that it would come off the money i am recently transferring. thank you!

If you have money in the account when you make the order, it will come out of that, otherwise it will use your backup funding source!
If you actually transferred money into your paypal account, the money will come from that first...if there's not enough the rest would come from whatever external account is designated.
