Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?
here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. never sent the item, then (according to paypal) they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?

its $5000! thats a big deal! you should contact ebay, there is , however not much you can do
I Was On Ebay a little While Ago And I Remember There Was This Thing Where Ebay Protects You From This.I Think They Give You a Refund I'm Not Sure.
Contact police.Tell your bank.See if they can help.
You should be covered under eBay Buyer Protection: http://pages.ebay.com/coverage/index.html

Since you've tried to contact the seller already, contact eBay by clicking the Contact Us link under step 2 of the link I posted above.  eBay will then try to contact the seller.  After 7 days, they should call you back and see if things have been resolved yet.  If not, they should refund your money.
