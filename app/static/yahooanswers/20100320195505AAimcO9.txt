whats your fav. internet browser? I use Opera 10.50 USB, anyone else use USB ones or opera?


Nah man. I use google chrome.
I really like the tabbed browsing. :D
firefox
I have Google Chrome running on my flash drive, because it syncs my bookmarks with the Chrome on my desktop machine.  Anywhere I am, I have my bookmarks with me.  Opera is a good browser, but sometimes it doesn't render all the pages or characters correctly.
I love the Opera browser. Doesn't take up much space and is simple to use, and even has tabbed browsing. It doesn't have a lot of useless toolbars and security holes like IE. I even use Opera Mini on my Berry. It's way faster than the native browser.
My preferred internet browser is Firefox. It's the not the fastest browser, but has a load of add-ons that I can't survive without. I'm willing to trade a little speed for more features.

For a portable USB browser, I use either Portable Firefox or Portable Google Chrome.

None of the major browsers are bad though, even Internet Explorer. Lots of people give Internet Explorer a bad rep, but it isn't a bad browser. In fact, it is the most secure browser.
