Is it possible to get anything on Lockerz?
I know I have to wait for them to restock, but are there even that many videos on there? Has anyone gotten anything?

Yes ,
Its more then possible to redeem from Lockerz , I suggest you to use LockerzAlerts service - http://www.lockerzalerts.com , they will send you text message to your mobile phone when redemption occurs so you wont miss it ! as you may now every second counts because prizes are going out of stock really fast !
yeah you can get alot of stuff on there. ive gotten a macbook
