Foxfire start-up file...how to disable ?
Just got Foxfire and unlike Windows Internet Explorer, Foxfire has a screen/window that comes
up when my computer starts that gives me the option to select (on it there are two icons
the regular shortcut or the safe mode one) an icon to clic that will start the browser...
But I already have the icon on my start menu and the file window is only an irritant so
how do I disable it ? I have only an Athlon 3500 single core CPU (939 socket) so I have avoided
an up-grade due to having to buy a mobo also and adding more money to a computer which
after the Ram, PSU and G-card up-grade has cost me over $700.00..enough already..
But to lighten the load on the CPU, I don't have ANY desktop icons and use the start menu
to launch programs from...and since I'm running multiple windows, I don't need an additional
one occupying my task bar from the Foxfire file...please help me remove this unwanted
new file window...

Sorry Raymond, I don't know the answer.
