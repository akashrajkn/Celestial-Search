What is the average amount of time spent on a blog?
More specifically, it would be awesome to find out the answer specifically for travel blogs. Thanks in advance for your help!

Not sure what you questions is.  Are you asking the average amount of time it takes to create and maintain a travel blog?  The answer to that question is it's entirely up to you.  I can spend 3 hours a day working on my blog or I can spend 1 hour on the blog and 2 hours on promoting it.  To get your blog off the ground I would suggest at least 10 hours a week to start.

Or are you asking what is the average amount of time a visitor spends on a travel blog?  Depends on how good the content is and how engaged the author makes the reader.  If you are familiar with bounce rates, I always suggest trying to get your bounce rate below 70%.  I have blogs where the average visit time is less than 30 sec and other blogs where the average visit time is over 5 minutes.
