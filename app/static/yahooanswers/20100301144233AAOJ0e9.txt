Why do forums turn people into a55holes?


I answer in Bleepingcomputer, You actually will get a detailed question, whereas in here, You get a question Like the last one i answered.. Which forum have you got in mind.. See,, no details.. LOL  ~
Edit :  I agree with Alicia. This forum, does not have a live moderator.. thus, peeps can post almost anything.  Besides this forum, what other one DOES have rude peeps.. i am just curious as to which ones to stay away from,, i have already limited my use in this one because of the Crap in this forum.
That's a very good question! I'd hazard a guess that it's because people feel they can get away with it. The internet takes away face-to-face, personal accountability for one's behavior; now you can be a jerk, change your username later, and no one's the wiser. But to not blame it all on the medium of the internet, some people are "a55holes" to begin with. Some people enjoy getting a rise out of people and that's the sole reason they post the way they do. Just ignore it and no attention for them! ^^
