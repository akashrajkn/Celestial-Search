You have to install the latest version of Firefox http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/
Then install 
Adobe Flash Player http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
Shockwave Player http://get.adobe.com/shockwave/
Java http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

You will find all the important plugings here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7

If nothing works then the best thing to do is a system Restore!

Click on Start
All Programs
Accessories
System Tools
And open System Restore

It will more likely fix the problems.
make sure you have java updated and enabled
