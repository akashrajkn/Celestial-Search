This has to do with net speed, or the memory level of your PC is too low. Just allow the streaming status to complete and then replay it.
watch after the complete of buffering the whole video
Just pause the vedio for 10 minutes then watch it.
Also install video accelerator.
Use this site for high speed vedio streaming.
