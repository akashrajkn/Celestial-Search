I need help with Flowplayer?
I have a php website I designed using dreamweaver (yay just another program to make coding obsolete so I know nothing about it). I entered this DIRECTLY under the <head> tag in my site code:

<script src=http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/flowplayer/extras/flowPlayer.js"></script>

Than I added this directed above my </body> tag in mt script at the end of the page:


href=http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/Videos/LastChance/Episode1.flv"
style="display:block;width:425px;height:300px;"
id="player">

<script language="JavaScript">
flowplayer("player", http://www.MYWEBSITE.com/flowplayer/extras/flowPlayer.js");
</script>

And when I go to the site it shows nothing there at all, but if I cursor over to where the video SHOULD be my cursor turns into the clickable hand icon and when I click a dialog box appears asking if I want to open or save the video (as if I were downloading it) Please help me out! I just want a general idea of getting this to work.

NOTE: I do have my entire flowplayer folder hosted on my server and the URL's in the script are accurate.
