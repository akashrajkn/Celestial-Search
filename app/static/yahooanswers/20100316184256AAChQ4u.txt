I spend too much time on the internet? (10pts..)?
I spend waaaay too much time on the internet.
I try and watch tv every couple of hours,
but it sometimes bores me.
Any suggestions on how to stop spending so much time on the internet, as well as a list of other things to do? :) thanks!

Close the laptop and go outside.
Well, it sounds like you're addicted to the internet.  What you need to do is limit your time slowly, not drastically.  For example, if you normally spend 5 hours a day, then for the next couple days spend only spend 4hrs 30min and the next couple days 3hrs, and so on until you feel satisfied with yourself.  Some things you can do instead:
clean (I hate it too, but it works)
read
play with animals(If you have any)
homework (again, if you have any)
cook
make something
many stores sell one-person games
talk to people over the phone
or these pointless but fun things:  http://www.urban75.org/useless/bored.html
Get up and play (outside) an hour a day.
