Can you delete a free webs.com site?
Can someone help me! I was wondering if you could delete a free website made on webs.com and if so how? Thanks so much.! <3
And can you also tell me how many free websites you can make under one account manager or email? Thanks. :DD

Yes you can! First, go to webs.com, log in, and it should show 'Sites I've Created'. In the box for your site, there are options highlighted in blue at the bottom. They should say 'manage members' 'upgrade to premium' 'settings' and 'delete site'. Click delete site, and it will probably ask you if you're sure - just click yes, and your site will be deleted!

P.S. If when you go to webs.com, it automatically signs you in and brings you to the page that shows you the specific pages for your website, just click the webs.com logo and it will bring you back to the homepage, or what they call the 'dashboard'.
