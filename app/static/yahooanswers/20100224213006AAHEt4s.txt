OR:
Call 800 827-6364. Say: "Cancellation." You'll need answer to your security question. Voice recognition not bad.

Then a live attendant. They ask why you're cancelling the service. Just repeat: I didn't like it. I didn't like it. Don't be any more specific, or they'll go off into a tree.

Then they'll ask, are you planning to go on highspeed? Do you want high-speed? 

No. No. No. No thank you. No thank you. Just repeat. You'll have to do this about five times. Amazing. Like talking to an automated attendant who can't understand what you're saying.

Don't explain anything, or it just takes longer

JUST KEEP SAYING NO NO
When I called to cancel years back, it was fairly simple, only a few minutes total. Probably after that bad press they got that you see in the video they eased up.

But in like 1996 when i called to cancel the free hours I got for the microsoft network, it took maybe 15 minutes before she would just cancel it. For some reason I had to give a explanation for canceling that makes that AOL video seem like nothing.
John Thom I just love your answer !! and it is soo effective.
I found AOL soo invasive
and with cancelling, they just sit in your neck and dont get off.
One almost has to be rude.
So, your answer is : THE ONLY ANSWER !!!
