where can I upload my vids of me dancing in underwear? youtube deletes them?

I need critiques on my booty clapping...anonymous critiques...so the internet is perfect for that. but for booty clapping to be seen, one must be in their underwear. so where do I go?

you could just send to me
Well, I'd say that the orthodox population would only upload these kinds of videos for their friends. Since it is that way, just give it to your friends manually.
A better question to ask yourself: Why do you feel that you need this kind of attention?
STOP ATTENTION SEEKING.
You don't....
photobucket would work for you
You can upload them to me if you like but I will probably delete them after a brief stint of entertainment. But other than that most of the big none pornography related video websites will probably eventually remove them when they get around to them.
hmmmm youtube shouldnt delet them if you have underpants on.... but try....
