Why can't i watch porn on my new computer?
i've downloaded the latest version of Adobe, it says something about javascript being turned on, but i dont know how to turn it on. i have a really nice gaming computer with world of warcraft so i know its not that. the tube vids just wont show up at all. please help im horny.

BTW- youtube works. its just porn that dosent. oh and i know for sure there is no firewall or blocker or some shit like that

it sounds like you computer has a bad virus.  someone could possibly be stealing your identity as we speak.  there is nothing you can do except sit there and hope for the best
This is a joke, right?  Its a video, so it will work.  Install Adobe Flash Player, thats all you need.
Have you installed the flash player? Most computers do not have that factory installed. If that doesn't work, try a different internet browser.
maybe your parents set up a parental control..
