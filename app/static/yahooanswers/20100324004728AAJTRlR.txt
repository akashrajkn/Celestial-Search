does surfing the internet on my iphone take up credit?
does it use up my iphones credit or is it just like using and ipod touch?
@tedris

mind your own business please.
@chris.

it's not worth it.

Depends on plan you have, may think about contacting your provider  ~
it depends on what kind of data plan you have.  If you have an unlimited data plan for it, then no.
I would like to point out though, that you really need to be careful about that.  There has been so many people having issues with their iphones, having unlimited plans, and getting $1800+ bills because even though they were in Miami, AT&T said they were roaming and the international rates applied.
Yes it does r u wondering because you don't want ur panrents to figure out ur dark secret lookin up stuff yarnt sposed to
Charges depends upon he data plan that you have.. If you have unlimited plan then  i don't think! and give a new look to your iphone from http://www.decalskin.com/ by using stylish iphones skins!
