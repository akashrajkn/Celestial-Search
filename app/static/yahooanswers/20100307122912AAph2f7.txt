Enable cookies on iPod touch?
Yes, I have gone on settings and enabled them under "always". But even then, it still does the same thing and shows "Your browser either does not support cookies,
or you are not accessing this site via its
fully qualified domain name. Please enable
cookies for this domain and try again."

It's in the Preferences app.
Settings>Safari>accept cookies
