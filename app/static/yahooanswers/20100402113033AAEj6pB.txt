What website is best for making a play list?
No downloads, it has to be free and available in the UK.
Tried playlist.com and it's not available in the UK.

Try playlist.com! It's really easy, and pretty fun.
playlist.com
either pandora,playlist.com,or itunes. 
hope it helps; good luck. :)
well the one that i use is called grooveshark and you dont need to download anything at all its really good and you can look up any song you want on it but you need to make an acount that takes like two seconds so yeah go and take a look
