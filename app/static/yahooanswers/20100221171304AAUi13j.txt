How do I stop word from opening when I click on a link in an email that should open with INTERNET explorer?
I am running incredmail 2. When I try to open a link that should take me direct to a web site, it opens in Word insted. I have been using incredimail XE for years and never had this problem till it upgraded to incredmail 2. Can some one please help me?

Strange. This shouldn't be an Incredimail problem at all.  The decision about what program to call to open a link should be made by the operating system, not Incredimail.  Try this:

In Windows XP:

1.Click on the Start->Control Panel menu item.
2.Click on Add or Remove Programs.
3.At the bottom of the left-hand list, click Set Program Access and Defaults.  (Because Add or Remove is searching for installed programs, this may not take effect immediately.)
4.Click the Custom radio button.
5.Click Internet Explorer as the default Web browser.
6.Click OK.

In Vista:

1.Click Windows button->Default Programs.
2.Click Set Your Default Programs.
3.Select IE.
4.Click Set this program as Default.
5.Also click choose defaults for this program and make sure they¡¯re all checked for your browser.
6.Click Save.

That should do it.
