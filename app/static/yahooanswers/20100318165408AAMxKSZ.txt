Lockerz..............?
Are the things lockerz gives away used or new

lockerz is a scam.
of course new
y would they give away used stuff?
They only give away new stuff.

And just so you know, I don't think it's a scam just because they don't ask you for any information when you sign up except for your name, birthday and zip code. You can also put in your address later so if you get something with your points they can send it to you. A scammer couldn't do much with that little amount of info.

You can actually watch videos of people on Youtube unboxing stuff they've gotten from there, including a Wii, Xbox 360, PSP, PS3, and one guy even got an 21.5" iMac.

If you want an invite, just message me.
