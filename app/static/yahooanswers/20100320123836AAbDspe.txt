You-tube ; how do you cope with the new design / format?
youtube for years was my most favourite site , top of my list really - but these recent new format changes have really f* hurt me a lot.

im just...speechless , i cant get over it.

they have broken what was working in my opinion and completely ruined the site.



1 ) whats happened to the quick-lists ?


2 ) how do you add videos to your quick-list and save them to a permanent playlist like before ?


3 ) why have they ruined the comments part and ratings part so it is now all '' scrunched up and unclear and disorderly ?



4 ) why have they put that pointless sidebar there with '' auto play '' to a most likely, a video your not interested in watching ?



5 ) why have they removed ' related videos ' and your personal ' quick-lists ' from the sidebar ?


6 ) how do you find your quick list even ?






can anyone answer those questions and  :

 how do you cope with the new terrible design and them ruining and suppressing a perfectly working popular website ?



and to mention  ; 

 on internet explorer  it has suddenly changed back to the old likeable format   -  does  this mean  they're just testing the new format   and they might change it back  ?

I don't know why people are always changing things that are already good and working well, older things are always the best.
I really disliked the changes as well, however, I think after awhile you'll get used to it. Some people do use a few of those features you mentioned, even though you don't...so others think its necessary probably. I would just try and get used to it...changes will probably be made in the future sometime again.
