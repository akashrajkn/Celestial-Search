can i give any of my 3 email addresses to get paid with paypal?
I have 3 Emails linked to my PayPall account, but only one is the preferred one, can i give to people my other 2 emails and the money will be deposited  in the same account? I'm confuse with this part in PayPal, What's the purpose of having more than one email address in one PayPal Account?.

if they are linked to your account then yes, you can.
