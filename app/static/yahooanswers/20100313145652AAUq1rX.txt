I need some help about my internet.?
Okay, so this is the deal.. I am on University internet,and everything works fine, like browsing the web, social networking sites. But there is one problem. My internet doesn't let me play any MMORPG, or any Multiplayer Games online, neither it lets me connect to PlayStation Network, I usually get errors like "Server taking too long to respond" "Server not found". Also, everyone in this building has the same problem, is there any way to fix it?
So I need to contact the Administrator?

It is because the internet administrators blocked all university computers from being able to use those type of media files you need to play games.
