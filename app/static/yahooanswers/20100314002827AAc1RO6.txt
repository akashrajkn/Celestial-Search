Help emails not working on outlook express?
Hi

I hope someone can help. I have two dedicated servers lets call them server 1 and server 2. On server 1 i have 11 email accounts set up and on server 2  11 emails accounts as well. I have them all set up in outlook express. It was all working fine and all the email accounts on server 2 are still working fine, they send and receive, but for some reason the email accounts from server 1 are not receiving now. I can send emails but when i press send/receive on outlook express it comes up with a red cross next to the email accounts and doesn't work then it comes up with the following error: The connection to the server has failed. Account: 'My email account', Server: 'my website address', Protocol: POP3, Port: 110, Secure(SSL): No, Socket Error: 10013, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E

Does anyone why it is that it will send but not receive and the others from the other server are working fine. What can i do to fix this? Help please!

compare the settings for server 1 against server 2, something has changed, and by comapring the two you should see what it is.
Probable reasons are
1. Check ur  name of incoming mail server in account setting. whether it is correctly spelled or not in 
Tool> Account setting > email> Double click on the email id>
or
2 Tool> Account setting > email> Double click on the email id> More setting > Advance>
Incoming server =110
Encrypted connection SSL = NO
 Check these setting may help you
