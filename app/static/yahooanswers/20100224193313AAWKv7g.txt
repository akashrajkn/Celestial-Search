Im very angry at amazon can anyone help me!!! ?
Ok so it was going to be my first time buying something at amazon.com
and i wanted to buy some earphones that cost 9.95 us dollars
and amazon said that stores like walmart target etc have gift cards of 10 20 50 dollars 
and i wanted to get the 10 dollar gift card because my mom doesnt trust putting her visa at amazon cus shes stupid i told her its safe but she still doesn't trust it so that's why i was getting the 10 dollar gift card so i went to walmart,cvs,target,gas station,!!! and there was no stupid 10 dollar gift card i drove my mom crazy going to each store so im mad cus i cant get my head phones and there 70% off!!! anyone know how i can buy them??no credit card.

Get a $20 card and but 2 sets?  or steal your mom's credit card and buy it, oooooor get a friend's parents to buy it and pay them for it when it comes
