You see, Lockerz isn't very that smart. They don't exactly tell you the date or time of the redemption. Its just in the hall, They say "The Redemption is now!", but they never say the time or date before it. I recommend joining swagbucks because it is like lockerz, but you search and win points but with those points you can get free stuff, but the store is open 24/7 with great prizes. Here is my referral link (if you join under it, you earn 30 swagbucks for free!)

Lockerz randomly has redemption days, never announced and they only last for 30secs. Tho it is possible.

I use swagbucks and have made over $100 in amazon.com gift cards! Prizes are always in stock. Its just like a google search engine but you win swagbucks for searches. Heres my link, and its not hacked.           http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rundee
you can't know untill lockerz announce it, but you can subscribe to http://www.lockerzalerts.com , these guys send you a sms whenever there is a redemption, and it's free.
