If discovered that broardband speeds in excess of 24Mbps could be obtained, briefly, using a copper network?
Would you ask for a refund?

No, because the network operator would blame network utilisation (how many people using the network at any one time) on the slower speeds.
the ISP always says up to ??? Mbps
With your user name I smell SPAMMING.
