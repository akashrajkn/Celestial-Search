My Internet Explorer and Firefox programs don't work....help?
Hey...
So I just used HouseCall to remove a malware/virus program on my laptop.
It got rid of the virus....but completely removed Firefox and Internet Explorer with it, leaving only the shortcuts and the buttons on my program list.

What do I do to get internet back on my laptop?
But I don't have internet to download them....so I'm kind of stuck....I'm on someone else's pc asking this.

u can try to download the firefox or internet explorer. do one of them. it may cause a virus if u download both. hope this info. helped.
You can do IE restore with RegTOOL.
More benifit, With RegTOOL you can safely clean and repair the windows registry with a few simple clicks.
