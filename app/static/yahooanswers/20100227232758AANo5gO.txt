Does Lockerz actually work?
does lockerz.com actually give you prizes?

dont know dont care its a spam site
I think only for US
Yes they do but there very hard to get. They have redemption days like once a month. They are not announced. And you have no clue when they'll be. 

Just a suggestion- look into a swagbucks account. Sign up under my referral link tho please.

btw swagbucks is horrible evrything was increased by 10 times as much and points are now even harder to get, i gave up on swagbucks now im just accumulating points on lockerz for an ipod worth 325 ptz and im getting over 10 ptz a day so you can see how  soon ill have my ipod
yes my friend got a shirt and will redeem a xbox next redemption
