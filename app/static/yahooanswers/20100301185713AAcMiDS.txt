Why can't I send an AIM message to someone's cell from my cell?
Every time I try to send an AIM Instant Message to someone who is "mobile", it says "System Msg: User is not logged in".

However, I get on my computer before AND after trying to send them this message, and on my AIM on my computer, it says they are "mobile" and I can send them messages just fine, and I can receive messages from them just fine as well.

Will entering my "mobile" onto AIM help change this? Or are they just trying to sell me some product or service?
