How do I download itunes music to the computer?
I just bought a bunch of music from itunes, but I can't put it on my MP3 because I don't know how to get it in the little My Music area of my computer.

just open your mp3 by going to my computer, and open itunes and drag the music from itunes into your mp3 part that youve opened from my computer :)
