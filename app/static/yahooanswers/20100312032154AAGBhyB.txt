Well Kailash it depends on Industry, Keywords, domain age etc.
You can do this faster without SEO which is typically a long grueling process especially if your website is in a competitive market.

A quick and dirty way is youtube buying. Basically you find a popular video related to your site then contact the creator of the video and ask to have them put a link to your site in the description of the video. Of course you would offer to make a small donation for their trouble.

It really is one of the easiest and surefire ways to get targeted traffic to your site and fast.
It depends on what sort of seo strategy you are using as some of the marketing method are more effective than others. One of the vary effective seo and marketing method is article marketing. By using article marketing and other link building methods it should be very realistic to get 1000 visitors in one month.
The only way that is possible is with article submission - ezine, buzzle, goarticles, ect.

I now run a seo firm. I can tell you out of everything I've learned, the most powerful traffic methods is article submission. This has ranks most of my website on the first page of google, and brought tons of targeted traffic.
