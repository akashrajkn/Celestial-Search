Is my blog appealing?
I know we aren't supposed to advertise blogs, so thats not what I'm doing... Im merely asking, is a blog about my daily life and all the stuff that happens in it gunna attract visitors? and where can I advertise my blog? are there any good websites (FREE) lol.... hmmm, i just want feedback and advice from my posts really. the address to it is msow.wordpress.com but thats not really important ehre, I just want to know if any1 wud read it and where i can sort of advertise it.

Im not using this as advertising btw!!

Thanks in advance :)

Just watch video of your users to see what they spend their time looking at by using http://exactostats.com/?r=ma
