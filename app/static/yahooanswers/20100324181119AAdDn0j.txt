Is swagbucks reliable?
I just joined swag bucks and wanted to know if anyone has gotten anything has gotten anything they ordered from it.

No!
No it is not!
yeah i got four amazon gift cards so far. It takes FOREVER to build up points so in light of more recent discoveries i think Mr. Rebates is better since it gives you straight cash back with better advantages than SwagBucks
yeah ive gotten about 30$ in amazon gift cards already and 1600 ms points

definitely reliable, so I'm not sure why those other people said no
My amazon account is $80 so far, I have joined 6 month ago.
Totally legitimate and real.
Check their facebook wall, they have 150 K fans all talking and helping each other.
For sure, I just cashed in my 50$ amazon gift card from swabucks to get a video game. They give you prizes for free but they get paid by sponsors and make profit... so its a win win situation for everyone :). Only problem is you can only make about 10-30 swagbucks a day from searching and if your lucky, an extra 5-15 from downloading the swagbuck toolbar (which tells you the secret swagcodes you can redeem for bucks. If you want to earn tons of swagbucks than i suggest you refer others to the site using your referal link (found by clicking on "promote" on the homepage). When they sign up and earn swagbucks you earn the identical amount (if they earn 10 you also are credited 10 swagbucks). So share your link with your friends and others and enjoy the free stuff :).

If anyones interested in joining this great site than here's MY referal link :p http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/PomiFTW

Oh and if you're interested in amazon cards, get the 5$ ones, the 25$ and 50$ cards are less economical.
Its legit. I have 228 swagbuckkss !
Yes it is!
