Anyone know what a good proxy site is for tagged in hong kong, i have tried loads but none seem to work?
i think most of the ones i have tried are for usa, china etc, i really would like one for hong kong

((( surfxmatic.info ))) is the best unblock site ( for me and for all my friends ) that include a large list of fast, free, new, and working proxies that up to date every 30 minutes , you can using it to bypass your school filter, access and unblock all blocked websites ( i believe that : Surf X Matic is smarter than any smart web filter )

Good surfing
where is my vote ?

Cheers...;)
