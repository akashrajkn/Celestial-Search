Does anyone else like the new AOL homepage?
AOL changed their homepage a few months ago, and I've just started using it and I love it.  It's not cluttery like MSN and has more than Google (its search uses Google I think).  It also has some pretty interesting designs. 

I always hated their internet access, but their homepage is pretty good.

Tell you the truth, I think the new Yahoo page is the best, although AOL's mail system isn't too bad.
You mean AOL is still around?
