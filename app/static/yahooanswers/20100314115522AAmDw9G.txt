Poptropica Cheese Touch?
I gave myself the Wimpy Kid Cheese Touch on Poptropica, and now it's not going away. Without making a new person, do you know how I can get rid of it? thx

The Cheese Touch is a special use item. If you have another ad-game special such as the Toy Story soldiers (now appearing), using it should cure you of the touch. You could also try using an effect from the store (such as Snow or a follower)
