Is this a good internet connection speed for Eircom at 7mb download speed with 50gb per month between 5 people?
My mother & her partner rarely use the internet I download a lot of torrents & my two brothers use youtube a lot.

Download 6048kps

upload 309kps

the speed is acceptable but I'd be careful how much you download, I can get through that in a week.
