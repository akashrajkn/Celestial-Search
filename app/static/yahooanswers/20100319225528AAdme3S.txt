Counterfeit dvd's on ebay?
I don't want to get into a big thing here. But I spotted some stuff on ebay that is clearly counterfeit. Obviously ebay wouldn't want this. But in the United States can your get in trouble for owning counterfeit dvd's

I don't know how this is a question.
But I'll shoot.
Okay, counterfeit DVD's is piracy indefinitely, but eBay doesn't go on the prowl for this kind of stuff.
And, most of the seller's are from different countries anyways, so as long as they can get through customs, they make their way over here.
Well its illegal to buy , sell  so if its illegal to
buy then its probably illegal to own
but its all right as long as you dont 
sell them or tell everyone about them
and if anything ever happens ........DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE
hahahah
lol jk but if u get caught somehow
just say you bought it on ebay and you didnt know it was illegal
because your just an innocent shopper on ebay its not your fault you accidently
bought an counterfeit dvd
so if u do decide to buy it just keep it to yourself
if the seller doesnt have a original case that is a sure tip off but if you buy & a seller ships it to you i wouldnt brag about it to strangers.
