WELL I DONT REALLY THINK YOU CAN BUT THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS REPORT THEM TO THE MYYEARBOOK STAFF OR AVOID THEM BY GOIN TO THERE PROFILE AND AVOIDING THEM BUT WHAT I WILL DO IS REPORT THEM ITS THE BEST THING TO DO.GOOD LUCK
The only way that you can make your pictures private on myyearbook is to make your profile private
