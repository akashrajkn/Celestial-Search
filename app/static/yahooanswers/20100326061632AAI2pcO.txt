What should I name my blog?
I am going to start a blog and I am looking for a catchy title.  The blog is mainly for family and friends, and will consist of my musings, book and movie reviews, details from vacations, and well.. just anything that I feel I need to blog about.

Can you guys provides me with some suggestions of a catchy title to help me get going?

Thanks!

The title of your blog should be, "I Can't Think Of A Catchy Title For My Blog". :)
Running at the Mouth
My Life, So Far
Reflections of Somebody, Somewhere
My Pursuit of Happiness
My Journey from there to here
Expressions of My Ups and Downs
Tales from my so called Life
