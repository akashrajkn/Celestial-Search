ebay question: how can i find out if a seller changed the listing right before the auction ended?
i bid on an item that i couldve sworn was listed with 'free shipping'. the auction ended and now there is a 4 dollar shipping fee (double what the item wouldve required, BTW). how can i find out if they changed it right at the end?

note that you cannot change an auction unless its 12 hours or more before the auction ends. So it had to be before that.

Check and see if this person has other similar items for sale and check feedback. In this day and age, feedback under 98% is bad.
