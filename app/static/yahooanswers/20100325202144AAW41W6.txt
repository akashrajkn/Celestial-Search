What is a site where i can watch new release movies that you don't have to do any offers or get viruses?


fastpasstv.com

But go pay for the movie first.  I only watch tv shows from there and sometimes I will watch a theatrical movie if I have seen it already and thought it was good.
The best one i know is http://www.youku.com/ a chinese website. Its fairly easy to navigate, i don't speak or read chinese and i use it all the time.
You can watch it online for free at http://biilt.com
Have fun!
