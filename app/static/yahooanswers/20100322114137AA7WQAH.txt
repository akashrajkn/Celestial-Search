Hey there, i have a fully functioning website and i want to add ppc adverts to my site to try and make some money. I dont want the type where i gain cash from every sale made i want the type where i get a few pence every time somebody clicks a link on my site. Also my site contains adult material dont know if this makes a difference. thanks

Take a look at Google Adsense for regular ads. For adult-oriented ads you can look into some of the existing adult sites (especially blogs) and see what they're using.
