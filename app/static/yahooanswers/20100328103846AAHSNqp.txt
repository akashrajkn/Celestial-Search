Cant browse internet??
Recently, my computer was infected by a couple of Trojan horses, but AVG got rid of them. now whenever I try to open up internet explorer or firefox, it shows an error message. None of my programs can connect to the internet. When i go to Control Panel > Network Conections, It says that i am connected to the internet. All my other computers and ps3 and iphone can connect to the internet, It is just that computer that cant connect. How do I fix this?

Try downloading google chrome or opera and reinstall ie and firefox. Try superantispyware to get rid or other stuff hidding in your system. Asquared found a virus that was hidden in my computer for 3 years try that as well. It is ranked #1 and can find 99.8% percent or malware.
Start > Run > type "cmd"> Black window appears> type ipconfig > check the ip address should not be 169.....
1) restart the computer
2) keep tapping F8 button till you get adv boot options
3) select Safe Mode With Networking
4) and try connecting to internet then will definately get thru
5) If it gets thru boot up again Normally and scan the computer again and chk if other softwares like Yahoo messenger work
6) Open Internet Explorer and goto tools> Internet Options> Advanced Tab> Reset Internet Explorer 
5) Also remove AVG (http://www.avg.com/in-en/download-tools) as AVG is not a good antivirus soft 
7) Download Avast from www.avast.com
8) Also register it from (www.avast.com/registration-free-antivirus.php) and you'll get a free 1 year licence key and believe me it works better than any other antivirus coz i've practically experienced it

You can write to me on my mail address if the problem persists "iamzuberkhan@yahoo.com"
