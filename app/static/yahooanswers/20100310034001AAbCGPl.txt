From some days i have been facing a strange problem and the problem is I can ping the websites but no browser can show the web pages.Initially i thought that it was a problem of ISP's but now i realize that it is internal problem of my pc. when i log on my pc for sometime i can easily browse the pages but suddenly when i open a new website browser shows a untitled in new tab. but when i ping the site it shows me my pc is connected to the internetbut it didn't show anything.when i pressing refresh repeatedly then sometime it comes but the pages like html look.I m basically a firefox user and i tried opera,chrome and ie. and same problem happens all the time and still i don't configure out wht the problem happens in my pc. Is there anyone to tell me what is the main problem and how can i fix this problem. Plz plz plz help me...It's urgent...

Are you pinging the same site that you are trying to view? Sometimes nameserver problems do not allow you to see sites even though you are connected to the Internet.

Check your computer for virus. Also find out if you are behind a firewall which is blocking you.

Next try www.whois.sc/sitename and check the IP of the site - then try to access the site directly by IP. This only works if the site you are referring to has a dedicated IP.

This is your OS problem, if your using Windows 7 beta or RC version, then please upgrade it.
