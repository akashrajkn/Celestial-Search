Turn it in .com question?
When you do that trick to lengthen your paper by making periods largers to 14 points, does turn it in.com see that?

i don't think so.
Nope.
No Turnitin.com changes everything to 12pts nomatter what it is actually
You wouldn't be the 1st to try to make your paper look longer by changing the font. Considering the amount of time it would take to do that you could slam out a few more paragraphs on your chosen subject. But good luck.
I don't think it does because the formatting doesn't transfer over.  You should be able to tell when it's letting you preview before final submission.  And hey, thanks for the tip about the periods!
