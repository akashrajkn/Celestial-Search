When is the Lockerz Member  Appreciation Redemption?
In the video the lockerz crew made they said starting at 9 pm but on the FAQ section it says wave 1 at 6-7 pm, wave 2 at 8-9 pm, nad wave 3 9-10 pm. Which one is it, the separate wave times or 9 pm??? please help, thanks everyone

ok. 
If you bought 1 wave (100 points) then its at 9-10 pm
If you bought 2 waves (250 points) then its between 8-9 and 9-10pm
If you bought 3 waves (350 points) then its all the times
