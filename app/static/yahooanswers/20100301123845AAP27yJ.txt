wheres a place where i can go and rant about my bad times?
i want a website (free) were  i can sit down and just let out all my angry (in words) 
 and people want to hear about it and ahh i dunno give me some advise or just say 
  ' hey i've been there to my friend.."

... um A.K.A  i need a site where i can rant... and get out my angry...

..um i dunno how to make it more clearer so does anyone know any sites like that? 
 i mean i can go on google myself i look for one sure yeah 
but  i like having other people's opinions .. just to be safe.
yeah i don't think a blog would help me any
 i have one on deviantart (journal ) 
 and lately my friends on there seem 
 to be a little busy and not really paying 
 me that much of attention but hey
 it's cool...  i know they have they're own lives and probably don't spend 
 as much time online as i do..

You could start a blog, but nobody reads them I don't think!
You could use Y!A, people rant on here all the time, but make sure you finish it off with a question otherwise people get ticked off!
facebook twitter and yahoo mail
why don't you just rant on yahoo answers? although people might think it's annoying, who really cares? i do it alot. just make a question called something like, "what can i do? it's driving me crazy?!" or something like that, and just rant on for ages, then at the bottom, put 'have you ever felt like this' or something. hope i helped :)
