What are some negative stuff about the internet?
You read about all the pros but what are the cons? If you find something offensive about yourself for example can you report it?

The net is an extension of life and the people in it and as such comes with the same pros and cons life does.If the site you see something offensive in has the option to report or to contact them you can attempt to report it.
yeah i'm pretty sure you can report things on most websites.

negatives of the internet:
-Pedophiles e.g. on social networking sites
-Viruses
-Stops people going out makes them become more lazy (can do most things on the internet e.g. shopping, chatting to friends etc)
-Bullying over the internet
-young children can access sites for anything e.g. things on violence which they shouldn't-bad influence.
-People can hack into personal details
hope this helps xx
Every pro has a con so just think of the opposite.

When the pro says the internet is good for knowledge then the con is the internet is bad for a load of crap!

Who at the end of the day who decides or defines what is good and what is bad? You do as an individual.

Mention the word porn and some people will throw their arms up in the air and go all hysterical over it and others couldn't give a toss one way or the other and some relish in it!

As for reporting it you are totally wasting your time even trying. No one body polices it.

What you have got to remember what is an offence in one country may not be in another. Most crap comes from countries who have no laws covering the internet anyway and there are no International Boundaries when it come to the internet.

As some one once said, if you are that offended over the internet then don't use it.
Nothing is free in world web,still people search for things appended with a 'free" word. That's the cons bro
