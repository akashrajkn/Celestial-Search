I have a question about eBay...?
If the bidding is really low on an item, say... $1, and it looks as if that low price is going to win the auction, what is there to stop the seller removing the listing from eBay before he/she makes a loss?

Really nothing, you just should set the starting bid at a reasonable price that won't hurt your sale, so they HAVE to bid that or higher.
NOT THAT I KNOW I GOT A 3 DOLLAR IPOD NANO!!!! IT DID WORK!!!!
Some sellers use a "reserve price", which must be met in order to seal the deal. If it isn't met, the seller can keep the item.

Otherwise, the seller can cancel the auction at any time, but incurs significant penalties if this is done in the 12 hours before the auction ends.
