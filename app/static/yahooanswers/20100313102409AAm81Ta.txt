lost internet connection?
My cable internet stopped working.  It says "Domain Name server is unreachable". any thoughts?

Report this to you cable provider
There is a reset button on the back of the modem or router (its the small box with lights on it that is connected to your computer).

The reset button is very small and hard to press sometimes.
Use a paper clip or pen to press and hold it in for 5 seconds.

You can also unplug the modem or router from power than plug back in.

Wait for a few minutes for it to reconnect.
