Do those "screw you emily" websites work?
Just curious. XD you know what I'm talking about? those websites that have popped up all over the place recently that are apparently made by a dude getting revenge on his cheating ex girlfriend or whatever by posting naked pictures of her and promising more if you post the link to the site all over the internet. do those sites actually work?

Nope, the stories are lies. It's just another form of spamming/chain emailing.
yes they do, i tried it out...and they do work. A little weird but they do indeed work. hope this helps
every guys i doing them now 
like all over facebook there are referals to i hate hailey, megan, blah blah blah........
Idk if they are true or not.  but I know that its messed up what they are doing to that girl
Not sure but there are easier ways to get porn
No. After you get so many visitors, they'll ask for your email address to confirm, then ask you to fill out surveys and subscribe to something before they can show you anything. Once they asked me to join a Disney gift registry, I gave up.
Nahh, if you go all the way to the bottom of the website, there's a 'Disclaimer' link and it tells you it's a fictional site.
Yes they do, I tested the Emily one by opening a different browser and clicking my personal link with proxies.
the screw you emily one shows up a load of pictures, but no video at the requested amount of hits

the disclaimer at the bottom says that they're just models and not a real gf anyway
Yes, they work.  No, it's not 100% real.  "Emily" is just a few models over 18.  You can get the pictures though if you invite enough people.
well if you ant to know go on this sight its one of them and it works
