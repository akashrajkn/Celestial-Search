Is anyone else having problems with Megavideo?
In the past 3 days every time I use Megavideo I get to only watch 10 mins of it & then it will stop & say I have watched 72 mins & have to wait 53 mins to watch any more. Before I was actually getting to see 72 mins of my movie before it would stop, but now I am just barely getting to begin it.
It didn't do that before, just started doing that to me in the past few days. It is only site way I can watch season 5 Ghost Whisperer episodes (I go to surf the channel & can only find links for Megavideo for them).

That site always does that.  It's a waste of time.
