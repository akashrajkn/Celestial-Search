What is an OTX survey?
I am reading reviews on survey sites and keep hearing people complain about "OTX surveys". What are they talking about and how can you tell if a survey you are taking is an OTX?

"Also known as online testing exchange, is an online survey company. You earn points for each survey you complete and an entry into a monthly sweepstakes. You get 600 points just for signing up; you can spend the points on gift certificates or give them to charity. A ten dollar gift certificate costs 8000 points.

# Our rating is from 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. Our rating is based on these factors: Number of surveys we receive from them.
# Amount we earn per survey.
# How fast we get our payment.

OTX Survey Exchange: 2
Reason: You are very limited in how you can redeem your points; there is no option to receive cash instead of a gift card. Also you are limited to 5 referrals. If they would increase the number of referrals you were allowed we would have given them a higher rating. We receive about 1 or 2 survey invitations a week. Each survey is worth between 200 to 1500 points, and they take about 15 to 30 min to complete."

You probably have to be on the site to use those surveys. They may send them to you via email.
