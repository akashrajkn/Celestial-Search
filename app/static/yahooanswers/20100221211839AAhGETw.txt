If it is an addon, then you can find and uninstall it as follows:

1- go to Tools | Addons

2- in the Extensions tab, there is a list of installed addons.

3- find RadioBar and press the "Uninstall" button below its name.

4- after doing the mentioned process, your firefox should be restarted .

Good Luck
