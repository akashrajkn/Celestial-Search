But I've downloaded Firefox 3.6 over and over again, and before 3.6 came out I still had the latest version, I always download when there's an update. But now it's saying I have an older version? I don't understand. Also, when I go to my Help-->About Mozilla Firefox I get:

Saying that I have 3.6?
I don't understand, what am I doing wrong?

-I don't want to switch browsers, I really prefer firefox.
-I've uninstalled and reinstalled - No help
-I've gone to the site and tried to update manually, still no luck
-Tried the alternate shortcut-Nothing
-No Updates Available
-Bitdefender- No Infections found
:(
-I've always downloaded it from the Mozilla site

Thank you for the tips so far

when Firefox is saying that you got latest , then it is latest one for sure )) *grins*

or another possible thing could be that the shortcut link on desktop you have got is pointing to old version firefox's folder. the new version should have the shortcut here:

C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

also try to update it via : Firefox's Help menu >>Check for updates . 

or might be you're infected by any botnet or virus.

Edit:

this is a yahoo edition (although never heard of it)

1.So uninstall any version of mozilla installed from control panel , also remove any yahoo toolbar.
2.Now go to program files : C:\Program Files\
and remove any firefox folder e.g : Mozilla Firefox , yahoo firefox , or look in any yahoo folder that has firefox folder inside or not
3. Go to C:\Documents and Settings\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\Application Data\
and
C:\Documents and Settings\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\Local Settings\Application Data
and delete the Mozilla folder.

4.Download the firefox from the given links:
http://hyperion.zih.tu-dresden.de/moz/firefox/releases/3.6.3/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%203.6.3.exe 

http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.6.3&os=win?=en-US

P.S : please take any bookmarks backup before doing this , also you can do step 4th as 1st step , download it first.

i hope this time it should help
might have something to do with being a yahoo edition, try uninstalling again and download Firefox 3.6.2 from mozilla
