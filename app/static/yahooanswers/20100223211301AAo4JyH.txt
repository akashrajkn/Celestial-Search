How do you send out "shouts" on Twitter?
This is my first time using twitter and I'm trying to figure  it out...so how do you use "shout" ? I'm still confused about twitter. Any advice will help. Thanks, Delia :) It's not like facebook at all. :p

If you mean a shoutout, then all you have to do is tweet either 'shoutout to [username]' or 'go follow [username]' or something along these lines. You can also say positive things about them. Some poeple will tweet 'shoutout4shoutout' where if you give them a shoutout, they will give you one back. If someone randomly gives you a shoutout, then you don't have to give them one back if you don't want to but it's always nice to say thankyou to them, that way they may give you more in the future! 
Fridays are known as 'Follow Fridays'. This is where you give shoutouts to lots of people on friday. eg. 'FF! @[username] @[username2] @[username3] etc..' (FF = Follow Friday).

Hope this helps :)
