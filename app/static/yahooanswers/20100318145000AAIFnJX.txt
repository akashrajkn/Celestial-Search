Is being paid to spam craigslist bad?
I LOVE craigslist!
Now there is a site that pays you to spam them!
craigspimp.com is the site, and it is making me pretty scared that craigslist will change.

what can I do to stop it?

Do you think it is morally wrong to spam craigslist for monetary gain?

WOW!!! Thanks for the info bro!!! $$$ Cha-Ching!!!
craigslist has always had spam this is nothing new and that site that says it will pay is a scam to get person info. it's the internet so you always have to be careful. yes it morally wrong that's why everyone hates spammers.
Craigslist is the biggest unsecure market ever made. You can buy hookers on there just so you know.

I would just stay completely away from it!
it all depends on how you are doing the spams
morally wrong ?  spammers should be put in prison for the rest of their lives.
