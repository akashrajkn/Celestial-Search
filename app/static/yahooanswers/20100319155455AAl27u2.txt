Apart from the obvious...what else is illegal on Omegle?


Nothing? I mean.. What would be illegal? It's the internet, on such anonymous chatrooms, everything is legal.
Or well, if you show like child pornography on the webcam service, then I'm sure you'll get a knock from the FBI a few days later, but other than that.. Yeah, I think it's all ok.
