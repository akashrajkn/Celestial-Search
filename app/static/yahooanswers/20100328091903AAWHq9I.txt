Is terms and condition page free or..?
I have my own website,i want to put my own terms and conditions so is it free or do i have to pay like the copyright.Are there any certain rules that i have to follow?

1st, you spell voting wrong... you said voteing.

2nd, Ahoy! Headquarters? Seriously?

3rd, Terms and conditions are simple... Make a new webpage, call it "Terms and Conditons" and put everything you can think of. As far as I know, its free to type.

You can use Weebly's terms of service as a template. http://www.weebly.com/tos.html
