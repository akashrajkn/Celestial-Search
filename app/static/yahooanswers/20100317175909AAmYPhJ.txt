I Don't Have A Laptop But I Have An Ipod Touch && I Was Wondering If There Is A Way To Get Wifi If I Don't Have A Laptop && With Out Buying A Wireless Router Please Help

Nope, you need to buy a router and buy the service from an ISP. It doesn't come out of thin air (it does, but you have to buy it first).
