What site can you watch tv for free?


tvshack.net
hulu.com
Can't help wonderfing why people seem obsessed with watching TV on a smallish screen while sitting bolt upright at their computer.
I'd much rather relax in an armchair and watch a full size TV set
websites :tvshack.com, hulu.com, justin.tv

programs: tvu, sopcast.

these are good programs or website that have most of the channels online,
