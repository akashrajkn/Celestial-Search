What exactly is a Beta Reader...?
What exactly is a Beta Reader on fanfiction.net, and what does it do, how does it work, etc. Thanks!

A beta reader is basically an editor.  I've never had a beta reader, but I don't update enough, and my grammar is fairly good.  I have a beta profile on FFN's sister website, fictionpress.com (under the name Bagoosa, in case you were wondering).  I got a PM asking me to beta a  story, but I haven't heard back.  I think all you have to do is find the beta you want and send them an e-mail about it.  If there's something else, and experienced beta should be able to guide you from there.

I hope that helps!
