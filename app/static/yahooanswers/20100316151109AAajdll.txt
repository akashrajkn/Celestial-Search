How often does 4 chan /b/ randomize itself or can i randomize it?
thanks.

Your question doesn't make much sense. But I'll try my best to try and figure out what you mean. 
4chan's /b/ board is named Random; it does not randomize because of this. 
It is named random as it is basically the place for any material to go that does not fall under any of the other categories, and you can post pretty much anything on that board. 
Though, I do not advise going there, unless you are over 18; and not easily offended, as there can be some shocking and adult material posted there.
