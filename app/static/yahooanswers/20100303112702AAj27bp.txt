What is a good website to use to locate someone and has accurate info?
I am helping a friend locate their spouse to have divorce docs served.  The person thinks that if the documents can't be served, there's no way to get a divorce.

I'm not asking for hostile reasons.  I am willing to pay for services, but there are just so many out there!

Have you ever used a site like this sucessfully?  What site was it or what was it called?

www.intelius.com
you can go to the yellow pages
Serving the divorce docs is not necessary in all cases, but maybe he needs it for closure or something.

I've never used this website, but I've had a friend that made up with their estranged mother because of it:  http://www.aaronspi.com/
