Can someone still find my search history after I've deleted it?
I'm giving away the old family computer to a friend. I was wanting to know if, after I've deleted the history from Internet Options or Properties can anyone see what our family has looked up?

If your giving a computer away or selling it, your best bet is to reinstall the OS, this will ensure that everything that has been done on the PC is wiped clean....
