On the game Maple Story, why does my characters keep getting deleted?
Sometimes I don't have time to play and when I log back on, all my characters are gone. Its really frustrating and it makes me not want to play it anymore because if I put work into it, they'll just be deleted the next time I get on. Why is that?

because you keep deleting it
Sounds like your account got hacked.  You should change your password and see if it still happens, and if it does, then it's just the game's way of punishing you for not playing in such a long time.  I don't really play the game, but that's usually what happens when someone else hacks an account.  Just be glad you can still log on, and once you do, change  your password ASAP!
Well maybe youre getting hacked
are you sure your clicking on the same world
well, i agree with some of the other answers, r u sure ur not getting hacked ? change ur pass quickly, and maybe ur accidentally clicking another world ? ur characters can only be in a certain world u know, and any further questions on maple story about ANYTHING feel free to ask me :) a player for around 2 years now (stweet2000@hotmail.com)
