g/f and i wanting to start an adult cam should we join a site for commission or start our own site? it will be based mostly on her and our exploits with other consenting adults. we would enjoy the creation and involvement required to run a site but are wondering about building up traffic, and that is why the commission sites are tempting. any info or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Any trailers for the new site
it's gonna be tough since there is soooo much competition.  i would recommend starting out on a site, and develop a good fan base there...  that was you can also try it out without too much commitment to see if you really want to do it.   Being a couple gives you a definite advantage since there aren't very many on there as opposed to the thousands of women fighting for attention.  You can then create your own site and put links to your site on the commission site and vice versa. That way they advertise for each other.  

You may want to check out www.rude.com and create a producer account.  they are different than most commission sites and allow you a lot of freedom and a variety of different types of shows you can offer.  Or make sure the site is one that is networked with a number of different sites so that you get a lot more traffic. 

So i guess my advice is do both and make them work for each other
