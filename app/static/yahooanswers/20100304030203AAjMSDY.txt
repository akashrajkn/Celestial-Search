'Watch This Item' link on eBay is not working?
I click on it and it does nothing. Absolutely nothing. It's only been like this for a few hours and I've tried signing out and signing back it but that didn't change it. WTF?
It's been a few days now and still nothing. I can't leave feedback either. This has never happened before.

Yeah its a ebay glitch,  sometimes it works, other times well you know the answer.

Edit - Have you tried deleting cookies, temp int files, clearing the cache all that sort of stuff.? I have seen problems identical to yours on ebays community forums.  Maybe you could try ebays live chat if the above doesnt help.
