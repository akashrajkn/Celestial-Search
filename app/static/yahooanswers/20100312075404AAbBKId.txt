Has anybody heard of this site?
I was looking for random stuff on the internet and I stumbled across an offer that said " Bioshock 2 Free" and the website is called www.nextdayrewards.com...it says that the game will come free next day shipping and handling from UPS

should i put my adress and all that good stuff, or just walk away from the offer

Leave it. If those were real, I'd have 164 ipod nanos and about $1,000,000 in WalMart gift cards.
They rarely ever pan out.
