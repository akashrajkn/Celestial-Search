You should call your internet supplier or something, but be warned they don't like to really help you when you call. You could be on the phone for like 6 hours before you actually get any valuable help.
Window is right
or ask your teacher for a printed version or stay after school and do it
It depends what online service you're using, try using Firefox, it should be compatible with it:

Not to mention it's more secure and safe than IE.
All IE's are crap.
Use Firefox much faster and more secure
