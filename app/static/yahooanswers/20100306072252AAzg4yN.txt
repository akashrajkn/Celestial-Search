How do I disable the "Congratulations - You have been chosen", etc. that come up on my screen many times a day?


Scan for malware you are infected
get a pop up blocker
Go to "tools".
Then Select "Options".
Go to the "content tab".
Tick the button which says "Block pop ups".
Then click ok.
These are good Freeware programs for your problem and help protect you in the future:

Spybot Search and Destroy: http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.h¡­ for browser hijackers and bots

Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/ for malware and bots and dns hijackers

Put all three on your computer and you will be protected well.
Spybot and/or Malwarebytes will be the ones to take care of your problem.  Avast would be if you do not have antivirus.
