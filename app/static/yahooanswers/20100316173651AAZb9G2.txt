Is My Website Name Professional?
I asked you guys about a name and whether it was childish, you guys said YES!

My name is Esmi, and the blog/website is about health, style, DIY, and life tips.

So would my name EsmiGercia . com be professional?

My readers would most likely be young women, what do you think?

I don't think you should put an address as your name. Make it something like catchy like that has to do with health style DIY and life tips- i like EsmisCloset.com!
Yes that is very professional. Many websites are a name + .com
