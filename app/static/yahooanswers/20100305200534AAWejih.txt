When will Lockerz.com launch?
Im waiting for lockerz launches...  Does anyone know when?

Most likely in the next few months.
I havent heard of Lockerz launches......if you are looking for an invite I can invite you though.
Lockerz is supposed to launch in either March or April. But it can't take much longer since they have been announcing this for months. It also says so on their facebook, twitter and youtube. If anyone would like to have an Invitation, please send it to robinsipod@yahoo.de with your email and you will recieve an Invitation within the next 24 hours.
Thank you.
