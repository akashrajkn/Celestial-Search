Why can't I follow people on twitter anymore?
I tried to follow someone on twitter but I got an error message, which referred me to this page; http://help.twitter.com/forums/10713/entries/66885 - According to this explanation I can follow 2,000 people and I need more followers to be able to follow more people. But the thing is that I am following only 27 people and I'm being followed by 918 people. So I don't get the problem? I did unfollow a lot of people recently, could that have to do something with it?

Your account seems to be significantly unbalanced and you probably appear to be a spammer to Twitter.  If you don't rectify this, you risk having your account suspended.

Try following a significant amount of the people that are following you.  If you're not following people, Twitter may think that you are just promoting and advertising and not engaging in social communication.
Yup twitter uses a "balance" to prevent bots..
