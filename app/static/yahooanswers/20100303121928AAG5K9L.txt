Verizon High Speed Internet General Question.?
Okay, well I just paid for Verizon High Speed Internet (FIOS isn't available in the hicks). I got telephone line "adapters" in the mail today along with a few papers to go along with everything. The Internet setup shows a modem with a telephone line going to it instead of a coax cable.
Is High Speed Internet, cause it looks a lot like DSL to me?

It is DSL. You need to get Cable.
DSL IS high speed internet! You got some line filters, but yes it basically just uses your phone line. Don't confuse DSL with 'dial-up' - it's much faster - up to 10-15MB/s if there is a decent fiber network in your area, but a minimum of 1.5 - 2 MB/s anyway, even over old copper phone lines.
