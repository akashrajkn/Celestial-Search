Lockerz not working but working?
Ok so lockerz is Not working on firefox but is working on explorer? Whats work?

As in on firefox it says lockerz is down for upgrades but on regular explorer I can log in.

Whats wrong?

maybe you should try using chrome, also make sure to check Lockerz site for any help with that, I know it works in Chrome, but I have never tried in Firefox. I also just hate using IE because it is really slow on my computer compared to any other browser that is on my computer.
