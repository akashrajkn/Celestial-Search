Unbelievably awful internet speeds? Download speed LOWER than upload?
I have TalkTalk broadband, and I get download speeds at an average of 4kb/s most days, up to an absolute maximum of 45kb/s, and I'm not joking... It'll take me a couple of minutes to download a 1mb file on most nights.
Not only this, but my upload speed is actually hioher than my download?!
That will often run at around 50kb/s.

Does anyone know the cause of this? I have 100% signal strength (sitting next to router), Belkin N Series router, and even my wired desktop computer is the same.

Thanks in advance, any advice is appreciated.
About 200 metres away, I know some houses get speeds get download speeds of up to 800kb/s. Although the south west of England isn't exactly known for good internet speeds, mine is just pathetic.

Sometimes your speed depends on your location. Also it has most likely nothing to do with your router. I saw on their website that they offer free support so you should call them.
Hi, The speed could be low for a variety of reasons, we can look into this for if you could register on the talktalk members website and start a new thread in the speed and web browsing section
