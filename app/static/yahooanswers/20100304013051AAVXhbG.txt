How do you make a picture non-savable?
I remember one time I was on Flickr and I tried to right-click and save a picture and it's saved this empty file titled "Spaceball". I was wondering if there's a way (or a different way to get the same effect) to do this on a site other than Flickr and if so, how? Thanks :)

I am going to take a stab at this even though I am not certain.

I would say that this is not completely possible.
You can use scripts to try and block right clicks.
You can use a flash-based viewer to prevent direct access.
etc
However, the browser's cache (temporary storage) can always be exploited to grab the images.
