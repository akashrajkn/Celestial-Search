He have interest in 
torrent site or rapidshare/hotfile searching site or any other which will be popular
or sites like tinypic

Plz Help Guys...
Surely 10 points for the best answer

It depends upon a person interests
A site that includes upload tools , or things to do with downloads that come from his site would go well with the site he/she already has
As u say, he is interested in torrent , then he can go for it otherwise video uploading and downloading sites like youtube, metacafe work great nowadays. why not try that one. well i like software downloading sites very well, which everyone needs every day for pc, mobile, pod etc....
