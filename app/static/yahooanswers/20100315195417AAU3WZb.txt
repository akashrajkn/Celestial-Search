What websites can I listen to music on for free?
What are some websites that I can listen to music for free? I do not want to have to download anything onto my computer for it to work, and I would like to not have to create any account either. Also, do not mention youtube.com, because the sound quality sucks.

I have iTunes, but I have no money to spend on songs right now, so don't bring iTunes up. I have tried grooveshark.com but currently it is not working when I try to go to it, and playlist.com takes forever to load after Myspace bought it out.

So, if anyone has some websites where I can listen to musci for free that is not Youtube.com, pleae answer.

Thank you.
EDIT: I failed to mention last.fm.com. Although it loads fine, when I want to listen to the songs, it takes me to a Youtube.com video, which I do not want. Thanks for the attempt though!

@ *Hottie101* I highly doubt that it is legal anywhere to download music for free.

beemp3.com
and you can even download for free it is totally legal!
www.last.fm is the only one that comes to mind.

There are some websites that offer free listening to mp3's but I honestly forgot the name. And not all YT quality is bad.
Hey Mate:

this is what you're looking for:

http://www.last.fm/

And well, on youtube, if you type in... " metallica nimes  high quality " or stuff like that, you can get pretty good quality music, after all.


Good luck :)
http://www.last.fm/    &  beemp3.com  you can get free music on these two web. i have another way to suggest you, just buy a download soft,  you can downlaod musics and videos freely. you can see more  information on this website. http://www.downloadvideos-convert.com/
