what does >.< mean? I keep getting it in emails from a friend!?
This is an emoticon but I don't know what it means! Help!

I'm not sure what the context is, but its 2 squinty eyes and a nose in the middle. A silly smile without a mouth?
Best I can describe.. Squint your eyes tight.. that's the face..
i think it's just supposed to be a cute way of signing her emails.. i prefer :P
my cousin uses -.-
It's something like this but without the lipstick.
