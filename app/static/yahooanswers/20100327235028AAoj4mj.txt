Help with tumblr and widgets?
I've been using tumblr for a while
but still don't quite have the hang of it. 

How do i install a widget? 
Like twitter, or a music player to my blog? 
 
Thanks x

i don't know about widgets, but i do use tumblr. At first is weird but u'll get it. Basically is to post pictures you like form your computer or other webstes. You can also post videos, songs, and even blog. If you like something that another person posted you can click the <3 shape and whenever you want to see it on the right click "Liked Post" and they will a pear or you can re-blog it and it'll be like you post it, but it will obviously also have who post it before you like a chain. 

Hope it helps even for a bit! 

Follow me, & i'll return the favor! =)
