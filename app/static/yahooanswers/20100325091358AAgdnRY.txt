What is the best kind of internet?
I know there is a lot of kinds of internet but I wanted to know which one is the best??
Like DSL, dial-up, satellite, High Speed, etc??
So, which one is the best and the fastest?
Thanks everyone!!

Fiber-optic is the best connection in most areas.

Fiber-Optic lines are FAR superior to Cable Internet connections.
High speed broadband is your best bet.  DSL is great if you like Pirate Bay. ;)
The fastest residential service is cable but that may not be available in your area.

DSL is the next fastest
Then Satellite
Last is dial-up
Time warner cable is fast for me.  I use Mozilla Firefox as my browser.  Hope this helps :)
All depends on what service you can get in your area and how close you are to the telephone exchange, I would recommend cable if you can get it.
Definitely the type that lets you view webpages and check your email. lol
Quest is great
DSL.
