How do I upload my icons to Livejournal? PLEASE HELP!?
I joined Livejournal last week, and I've spent the entire week trying to figure out how to upload my icons to Livejournal and I still don't know.

I want my posts to look like this one : http://community.livejournal.com/takessometime/

Please help! It would mean a lot :)

Send the picture to your e-mail address on here, then send the picture to your Live Journal email...look it up on your account settings...This works for myspace and facebook also..I am not fo' sure if this works on live journal but I wanna help..
