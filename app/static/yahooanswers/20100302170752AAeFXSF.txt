how to fix a broken link?????
I really need to go to a certain web site but it says the link is broken. How do I fix that? Just a few days ago I could go to that site but now I can't. I also tried to view it with my phone and it was working! However on my phone I can't view certain things I need. Is something wrong with my computer because the web site is working on my phone?

The website is not working correctly, or the link has some extra characters in in that point it in the wrong direction.
Broken link normally just means that the page you are looking for is not there any more.

If you are trying to go to a particular page, try to just go to the main site instead.

example:
instead of going to http://www.website.com/page1.htm just try http://www.website.com

Your mobile device might be using a page that is specifically for mobile devices - not the same as your desktop.
