I live in the UK... so why cant i use Spotify?
it says i need an invite to get a free account, which is all very well because of the huge amount of people wanting one from around the world. But i heard that there should be no problem for people of the UK wanting one, and i am one! so why is it asking that i need an invite first? 

p.s. im definitely not getting a premium account, ?120 for 12 months!? not worth it.

you have to register online first then wait for it to send you a confirmation email, you can download the software but wont be able to log in until you have the confirmation.
It's an invite-only service for free. Now, it is used in the UK with no problem. But what might be worth your while is paying for one month, then cancelling the payments. You'd still pay ?9.99, which gives you the first month ad-free, then after that, you have no more payments, but are left with a free account.

I think that what you heard about was when it was open to all, but when they got enough free members the invites were closed.
This place has some for sale if you want to buy one spotify invite
