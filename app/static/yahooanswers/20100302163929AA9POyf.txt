I wouldn't buy anything from a website that does not look LEGIT
if you dont know DON"T do it
If it were me I would not do it.
I would... mainly because you can use paypal... and your always covered with fraud if you pay via that... if your paying by credit card then no...
your just paranoid
The Web Of Trust add-on for Firefox says the site has received a *good* rating on trustworthiness.

This is definitely a safe place to shop, although it isn't the most popular.
I wouldnt
