How can I remove my phone number from DirtyPhoneBook?
So how can I remove my phone number from the website http://www.dirtyphonebook.com? There's some nasty comments about me there and I don't want my friends to see it.
Chhayly i cant find the option thing you talked about

i didnt even know such a site existed...
You go to the option or profile edit you will see to the box to delete.
That's an interesting web site.

Before you delete, think about it.  Are the comments really that bad?  This site isn't meant to be serious, it's just for fun.
