Has eBay gotten slower in recent months than they used to be?
I've been a frequent eBayer since 2000, and I must say that in recent months, and even more so in recent weeks, it has gotten so slow and unresponsive so as to be nearly unusable!  Am I the only one who's noticed this?

I'm on a broadband connection, and no other sites are slow for me.  What say you guys?

I haven't noticed anything with the speed of ebay I've used ebay for three years now & haven't noticed any difference.
