Where to Post a Pellet Gun for sale on Craigslist?
I have been trying to sell this pellet gun that I have on craigslist but every time I post it Craigslist deletes it. I was wondering if anyone knew on where I should post it. I have tried General and Sporting Goods.
I wrote .22 pellet rifle as the title but it still got deleted.

Sporting goods sounds like it would be the right place to post.  Just make sure that the title is very clear in stating that it is a pellet gun and not a gun that uses bullets.
