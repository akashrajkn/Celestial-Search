Can you pay Livejournal to unblock your account?
Livejournal suspended my account for unclear reasons, and I they haven't got back to me for the past two weeks despite several emails. I was wondering if it would be easier to just pay LJ to release my account if that was possible. I have a ton of stuff on there going back to 2004 that I'd like to get back.

Not possible and they don't really care about your account. As evidenced by their lack of response.
