Ok i have a paypal question?
ok i have a question about paypal, me and my friend are running a service on a game, and this guy sent us a payment as a gift, but we never recieved that payment, now he is saying he will call the police for fraud if we dont do it for him, can he do that?

Ask him for a receipt showing that he payed you.
If you never received a payment. Do not worry about it.  Why don't you ask him for proof of payment as you have no record of a payment from him.  This should take care of it!
Paypal will hold that money until you go to their site and ask for it to be withdrawn and sent to your own bank account. I bet if you log in to your Paypal account you will see it sitting there. Yes it will be fraud if you don't perform the service for which you have been paid.
haha he can't do anything
first ask him to show you the proof that he sent you (which he obviously doesn't)
secondly he can only involve paypal; they will check if you recieved it or not. so nothing to worry about
