Have polls about preferences that other teens can answer.  Most people consider their own opinions extremely important, so this should appeal to many people.  Ask for their top 3 favorite school lunches, recording artists, school subject, colors, authors/books, places to go on holiday, and things like that.  Call it something like "My Top 3" or some such thing.  If you want, ask for their bottom 3 as well.
