I think I killed my friends internet?
Well in facebook I tagged her in loads of posts because she tagged me in loads but then the webpage wouldn't show up and she couldn't go on anything.
What did I do!?
She has google chrome btw.

How do I fix it!?

oh
Can she just not get on facebook? If that is all it is then just delete the tags. If she can not get on the internet at ALL then it wasnt your fault
unplug her cable modem and her router. leave them unplugged for about a minute, and then plug them all back in. If that doesn't work then its probably not something you can fix.
Quit Facebook.... Join Orkut... :)
Any website activity should not affect ones ability to connect to the internet.
Most likely your friend is experiencing connection problems.

This could have many causes, but here are some common ones:
 * problems in your local network (disconnected cables or turned off modems)
 * problems at your ISP (internet service provider), usually temporary
 * problems with the internet/network settings of your computer/laptop
It is your fault for using Facebook.  But to answer your question:  Try restarting the computer or unplugging the router for 10 minutes.  Maybe it just needs a rest...
