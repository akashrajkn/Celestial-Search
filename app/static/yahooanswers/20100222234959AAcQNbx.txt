Everytime I open My Internet  Explorer or Firefox It keeps on  "not responding."?
It doesnt happen to Google Chrome, and I personally use Google Chrome on this laptop and now my parents are starting to use it cuz internet explorer and firefox wont work, and now their closing tabs that I need to kept open!
Does anyone know whats happening to my Internet Explorer or Firefox?

IE or Firefox may not work with your internet. What kind of service do you have? Dail-up, DSL, etc?
This might help. Go the website below, Download Ccleaner. (Make sure you click "Download Latest Version")

http://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner

Once it's finished downloading, open it up and once Ccleaner has opened. Click "Analyze" and when it's analyzed everything click "Run Cleaner". This should only take a second to scan since it only erases your internet cache etc.

Next, click on "Registry". Then click "Scan for Issues". Once scan has finished, click "Fix seleted Issues" (don't back files up) and then click "Fix all"

Now, try opening firefox or internet explorer. It should help start it. Before opening Ccleaner make sure you exit your current web browse so it can scan that.

I hope this work.

If you're still having issues, Msg me. I'll try help.
