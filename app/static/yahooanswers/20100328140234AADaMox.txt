how come there never used to be advertisements on yahoo answers and now there is?
when i first signed up for an account in late 2006  on yahoo answers, i dont remember ' ever ' seeing any intrusive, distracting advertisements  -  over the last year or so  it seems now they are a fixed , permanent feature.

i find them distracting and annoying at best  .  i despise them.

ive managed to block them on google chrome useing an ad block,  ive also blocked them on firefox  , but there are tons of ad ons on firefox  it keeps  freezing  and doesn't operate too well.

but  i notice the ads  are still showing on internet explorer  ,  i thought  i blocked them with a host file,  blocker   -  but the ads are still managing to show through..


is there any effective way i can block the ads through internet explorer ?

i really dont like them,  i resent their presence  and they ruin my enjoyment of yahoo answers.

Adverts generate revenue for yahoo.
You can get rid of them if you have the firefox web browser and install the flash block pluggin.

Firefox web browser download free here

The good thing about this pluggin is that if you click the F where the ad should be you can see what it was. ( some sites use flash so its handy to be able to turn on or off.
you can probably look in to the settings yah boy get them virses were gonna kick there but suckas yeah
I'm using Firefox with AdBlock Plus and NoScript and it works a treat, if it wasn't for your question I wouldn't know there were any ads on Answers!
