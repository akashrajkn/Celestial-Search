Why does Yahoo keep 'effing around with my homepage?
Why does Yahoo keep 'effing around with my homepage? Just to be CLEAR, I am NOT talking about MyYahoo. I am talking about the regular Yahoo page. I get the 'effer the way I want it and then some hillbilly, or maybe some doeling, over at Yahoo comes along and moves stuff around on my homepage. What's up with these people? I don't bother anybody, so why don't they leave my homepage alone already?!! Doesn't Yahoo know that if it isn't broken then they shouldn't be fixing it?! 'EFF!

Yahoo is doing a lot of bullsheet stuff all over the place.
They seem to be moving away from user friendly, to advertising dollar generation, at the expense of the former.
I grow increasingly dismayed with these annoyances, as you are, but the entire Internet is being swept up in this craze...and they don't ask if you want the change: they just go ahead and do it.
