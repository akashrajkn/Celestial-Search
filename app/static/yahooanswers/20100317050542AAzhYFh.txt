The main torrent website is The Pirate Bay, and it isn't on their sorry. You'll just have to buy it or watch it on TV, whatever rocks your boat.
Ill post some good torrent websites in the description you could check
1st: Download utorrent at www.utorrent.com. It is a program that allows you to download software from a torrent file.
2nd: Go to www.torrentz.com and search the file that you want to download.
3rd: Download the file.
4th: Open your program utorrent, file and open the torrent file that you want to download.

Make sure that the torrent file that you are downloading has enough seeds and health for the utorrent to download the file to the maximum downloading bandwidth of your internet.
