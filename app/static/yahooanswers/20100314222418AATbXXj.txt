How do i connect Itunes to firefox?
My internet explorer doesnt work but my firefox does. Itunes is connected to internet explorer so it doesnt recieve internet connection . Is there anyway to establish a connection between itunes and firefox instead of itunes and internet explorer?

Set Firefox as the default Browser.
Internet explorer sucks. Any way, set FX ( Fire fox) as your default browser...

All hail firefox!
