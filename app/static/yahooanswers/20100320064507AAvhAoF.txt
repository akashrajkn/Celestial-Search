Tumblr 'ask' page problem?
Hi,

I'm trying to set up an 'ask' page. I've done everything it says like make the URL /ask

But I can't see anything on this page.

http://bryonie.tumblr.com/ask (that's the page, I think it's blank.)

So, any idea what has gone wrong?
What is the html code for an ask box?

There isn't anything when I click html.
So can you see the Ask Box? Or not?

its not blank for me.
theres a picture at the top, the tumblr into @ the right, little text in bottom left.
Something is done wrong. I suggest pasting html code on microsoft word and checking it piece by piece
its not blank for me either

follow me, reblog me
