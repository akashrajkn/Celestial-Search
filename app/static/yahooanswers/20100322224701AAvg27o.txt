What private information can people get from sending files?
If I were to send a picture saved on my desktop (as a file) to someone via a messenger service, like yahoo or aol, what will the recipient be able to see/track? Will they be able to see my name that my computer is registered under or where it came from (desktop, documents) or just the name of the file? I have a macbook pro if that makes any difference.

Thanks!

i'm afraid yes
Yes, they can examine the packet and header information and get your IP and other information, but then again so can any website your visit.
