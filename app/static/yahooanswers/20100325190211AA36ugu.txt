Internet terms- Trawling Vs trolling?
Do they both mean the same thing? As in, surfing around a site is either trawling or trolling. I always thought a troll starts trouble and is a total idiot. What do you think?

trawling - dragging huge heavy nets
trolling - posting controversial, inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages
