Need a quick answer: Internet Explorer refuses to close?
I've already tried forcing it to close from the Task Manager, but it gives me a pop up that says, "The application is not responding. The program may respond again if you wait. Do you want to end this process?" It has two options: end process and cancel. I've tried both, but it's still open and it's been over an hour since I initially tried to close it.

go into task manager and right click on iexpolre.exe  and select go to process and end the process it takes you to it will then close
I've had that happen.  You'll need to restart your computer.
