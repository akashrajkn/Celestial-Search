What should I make a blog about?
I am a 13 year old girl. I don't really have any "passions" so I can't write about that. I don't have any talents that I can write about. What should I blog about? 
Thanks in advance!

Wow, you don't have ANY passions or talents?

How sad =`(

Just write a diary, but keep some of the more personal details [names etc.] private.
