They are good! I think I'll put in a bid-------I especially like the Owl picture
The listings seem fine, try putting a few as "buy it now" rather than auction style format.  People often just want to buy one quickly rather than bidding and wondering if they will win, especially if it is going to be a gift.  Try changing a few to BIN and see if that makes a difference?

Also your feedback rating might be what is making people hesitant. Its a shame I know as this is nothing to do with your work I looked to what the negative comment was. 

I've had the odd negative over the years and it ruins your 100% record but it will be gone after 12 months and you will get your 100% back. Many buyers don't even look at sellers with less than 99% feedback I'm afraid.
