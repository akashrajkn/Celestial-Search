New to Firefox - the look of it just changed on my computer?
I've only been using FF 3.5.8 on WinXP for about a week, but one thing I did like about it was that it let me see the different tabs/websites that I had open at a time.  Suddenly, now, I see that the tabs are not visible anymore and when I click the "X" up in the right-top corner, the page shuts down and doesn't ask me if I want to close out of FF anymore.  It just closes.  How can I reset it so I see the tabs again?  I made many other changes, so I don't really want to do a System Restore.  TIA.
Thanks!!  Works like it used to.  You were all correct - I'll wait till I can close this answer and then pick the first one as best answer.  (!)
Oh, not quite the same yet.  I did what you all said, but I still only see one tab, and a different URL in my address bar (on top).  I'd like to see two tabs, to see what I have open.  Now I can only see the one I'm on.  How can I do this? (thanks again)
'Guess what I'm asking is, how do I see multiple tabs (at top) when I have multiple windows open, so I can switch back and forth between them easily?

open up firefox.

go to Tools -> Options

Go to the Tabs section

Everything should be checked except the last option. If they aren't then check them off

Restart Firefox

Or update to the latest 3.6.2
go to tools menu, options, tabs, check "warn me when closing multiple tabs"
There's an option to show the tabs even when only a single website is open.  Here's how to set it:

1. Click the Tools->Options menu item.
2. Click the Tabs page.
3. Check the "Always show the Tab bar" checkbox.
4. Click OK.

Hope that helps.
