What does this mean, "Online entries may be subject to standard internet connection fees"?
I had recently voted online for MTV's show America's Best Dance Crew but I voted without reading the fine print. I says what was stated above and I want to know if I would have to pay extra fees on top of paying for my connection. And if so, how much?

Were you using your phone ?  If so. check with your provider for what your plan offers.   ~
It does not mean extra fees, it is just telling you that by voting, you are using your internet connection and therefore will be billed by your ISP at your standard fees for the content.
It means that if you have some sort of limited plan with your isp where you're charged for bandwith, usage fees, etc. your isp will charge you for accessing that site and voting the same way they charge you for accessing other sites. If you have unlimited internet you don't have anything to worry about.
