Ebay seller scammed me for 5000$ is there anything i can do?? Details inside!?
here is how it went down. the ebay seller had 100% feedback over 500 items sold. they were selling a camera that i bought for just over 5,000$. they then took the money, cashed it out to their bank account. then they removed their bank account and debit card from their paypal. closed down their paypal account. i have tried contacting them and nothing. they live all the way across the country. is there anything that can really be done? or am i just out of 5k here?

Ouch, for that much money I would want to have a middle man do the final transaction.

Have you contacted ebay, as they would have to have some records on their system?

How did you pay, Paypal, if so open a dispute with Paypal, 

If by Direct Debit/Credit, check with your bank directly they might be able to put a reverse/stop payment.

What contact details do you have for the person, surely a contact number of address?  Contact the local police in that area or look up the name(s) in the local phone directory, just try everything you can to try and find a contact.

You said they had 100% feedback with 500 items sold, do you recall any other usernames, or other details you can use to contact others to see if genuine or if they have any contact details?

I hope that helps a little, man I'd hate to lose that much via Ebay.
File a dispute with eBay.  PayPal will cover the money you paid regardless of whether or not the seller closed their account.  How do you know the seller removed their account from PayPal?
