Does trading in videogames on swagbucks really work?


No... swagucks is a SCAM!
Yeah it works, but you get ripped off. The number of swagbucks you recieve is insignificant, compared to the price it costs to but a new console or video game from their site. If you want to earn a lot f swagbucks in a short amount of time watch this video.
