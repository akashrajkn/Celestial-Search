When are the best times to end auctions?
On Ebay, GrapeWorm, etc.

when they are over.i like to post mine on mondays so when it comes to the weekend mine will be somewhere near the top of list
On eBay you're not allowed to end them 12 hours prior to the scheduled ending if they have bids on.
Most people check their auctions on the weekends, so I would actually have most of my auctions ending either Saturday morning or Sunday night. Also, avoid having them end during the week during the day. It's hard to snipe an auction if you can't keep tabs on it. And as a seller, you want to have snipers for your auction. I would suggest weekday nights (preferably Friday or Thursday), or Saturday during the day. Sundays you have to fight church and sports, and aren't assured of bidders.
the beat time to end an auction is when the bid is higher than yours
