Can I ship BIG things by selling them on eBay?
For example, I have a very old and VERY heavy piano that I'm thinking of trying to sell on eBay. But what I'm wondering is, something that big, can I just ship it with USPS? How do I go about shipping big things?

You have to ship it freight, an 18 wheeler, and it is expensive. Put it in your local sales paper first.
If you want you can specify 'local pick up only' in your ad. Otherwise you will have to ship freight.
A piano, specifically, would require specialized crating, I would think, that you'd have to hire someone to do. Unless it is very valuable, you'd want to sell it locally. If it is very valuable, so that it would be worth it for someone to pay for the shipping, you could certainly send it anywhere, but you'd need to hire a shipping company to do it.
I don't know your experience with eBay but I would highly recommend doing some research on piano sales comparing them to the particular instrument you have. You may or may not decide it is worth trying to sell the piano through that venue.

If you do want to sell it online, make sure you spell out to the buyers what arrangements need to be made for shipping and who is responsible for them. If you want to handle shipping a piano, I would recommend getting quotes from some local piano movers (not just a standard shipper or furniture mover) so you know what is required from you and you can get an idea of pricing. For distance shipping there are companies that specialize such as Modern Piano Moving at http://www.modernpiano.com/.

Good luck!
