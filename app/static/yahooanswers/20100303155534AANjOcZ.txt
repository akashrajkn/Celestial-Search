How do I get rid of the "Favorites" and "History" sections on the Internet Explorer Address bar?
I would like to get rid of these two sections just because I don't use them. I always use the down arrow on the address bar as well as the auto-complete. Is there anyway for the address bar to only show websites I've typed in and not my history or favorites when I click the down arrow?
These sections are list of previously viewed websites that appear after I click on the down arrow. I am not sure how to explain it better. It is not the favorites bar but part of the address bar.

Ok, First to disable the Favorites Bar, you need to go over the toolbar section and right-click.
Then a small window shows up and click on the one you want to disable. In your case it is the Favorites bar.
Here:
Hover over toolbar>Right-Click>Click desired toolbar.

Hope this helps!!!
