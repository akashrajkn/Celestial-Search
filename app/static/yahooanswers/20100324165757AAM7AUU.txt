site that pays you to refer webcam models?
Do you know any site that pays you (and how much per sign up) to find webcam models?

Go to the site below and click "become an agent" I think they allow you to do it.

Try placing some ads on classifieds sites like craigslist.etc
The link that Jason gave you pays an ongoing commission of 10% of what the model earns. You continue to earn that commission as long as the model is working.

livejasmin also pays you to signup models, but I stopped recruiting for them, because they reduce your commission every couple of months and after they model has been with them for a year they stop paying you. They don't tell you that upfront though, they just tell you that you get a 36% commission.
