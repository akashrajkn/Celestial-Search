Why don't we have free nationwide broadband Internet?
Think about it:

 * online retailers could subsidize the cost (because they will get more shoppers out of the deal)
 * it promotes growth
 * it encourages information sharing
 * it supports communication (within business, B2C, and B2B)
 * it would stimulate economic recovery
 * we did it with antenna TV (in the US, this began in 1928)
 * we did it with radio (around the year 1919)

There is some progress being made in this area (and Google is getting into the mix), but I think we need to think bigger: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6233NJ20100304

Who exactly would subsidize this cost? What determines a retailer? Are you just talking about the big companies (eBay and Amazon), or are you including the individual artists who sell paintings and photos on their personal web pages?  What about companies that sell products on the Internet but aren't located in the U.S. (not a problem with radio and TV)? With TV and radio, most of the money comes from advertisements- a single program can have millions of viewers/listeners. The same is not true of websites, so who would foot the cost?
i agree 100%
Marketers and othe such smarmy people have made the internet almost useless!
That would be great! There would have to be a TON of security on it though because you know somebody out there would want to destroy something nice.
Nobody has been able to put it together, or they have found it's not feasible.  I'm not sure there is a nationwide service beside the federal government.
I believe there is a country in Europe that recently recognized internet access as a basic human right and granted access to all of it's citizens. 

As the United States (or UK?) we're behind in the evolution of the institution of rights. And we never want to solve a problem. We simply come up with quickly produced and poorly thought out ideas and ratify them quickly to please the masses. But when the plans fail they get mad...
