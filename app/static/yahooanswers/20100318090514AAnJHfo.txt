How much dose Internet cost?
I just bought a house and was wondering what service should I get for the cheapest? But i would like it to be fast... What provider should I use? I live in York, Pennsylvania

I live in pennsylvania and only two companies provide to my area and our cheapest is comcast. It starts at like, 35 a month but after a couple of months, it like, doubles for some reason, but it is fast. However, I had AT&T Internet before moving to PA and they are about 45 a month and it was really fast as well. Hope this helps.
