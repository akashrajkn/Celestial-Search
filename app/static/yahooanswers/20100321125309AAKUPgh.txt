I ordered a book from amazon and it hasn't arrived after over a month?
What do I do?
I tried contacting the seller but I got no reply, he's been given good feedback before...

It may have gone to the wrong address or maybe something is up with the seller, he may have moved phone numbers or house etc.
Also, if the book came from a long way away, it could take a long time to end up at your house.
Try contacting amazon as well.

Thanks,
Alapot 
:D
