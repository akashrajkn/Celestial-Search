Who else hates advertisements that intrude on the webpage?


me!
Without those ads, you wouldn't have the internet you have today! There would be a lot less!
i think everyone does... but it runs its own economical system, and keeps the internet running =D
me me me! & prolly a ton of other ppl too!
I don't see ads. lol.
Gee. I'll handle polite ads. I know it pays for the stuff, just like it did for newspapers in the old days.

Like you, however, I hate the intrusive ones. I never saw an ad in a newspaper that blocked out or ripped up a news article or one that blared loud sounds, or one that started downloading Anti-Virus 2008...
Almost every person who uses the Internet hates Advertisements.

But you can simply eliminate them with AdBlock Plus for Firefox.
