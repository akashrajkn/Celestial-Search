My dad's internet is not working, How do i get it to work?!?
He's been yelling about it to me all day. I hate my dad, If he doesn't get it his way. He  starts yelling at me. FML.
But anyways , I'm in my room and it is working perfectly. But he's in a different room, Me & my sister is connected but apparently his isn't so how do i make it work . so he can stop yelling at me?
Everytime i refresh the wireless connection stuff it says no network available
It always works every other day but not this week.
How can i fix it?! 
Please help me.

He probably accidentally turned off his wireless card. Try hitting the "FN" button next to the Windows button and F2 to turn the wireless "radio" back on. If this works mention to him that I also suggested that unconditionally loving and democratic parents are essential to mental health and that critical and controlling parents are a one way ticket to therapy.
