which best among tata photon +, airtel,idea netsurf for internet connection?


I am using reliance broadband+ but in fact all the above services use the same technology. So the only thing you have to consider is the tariff. Reliance sucks.. I am paying nearly 1500 for a limited connection.
airtel is the best, next is tata indicom photon+
I think Tata Photon is the best because it has High Speed Internet Access Service you now have access to internet at super fast speeds using the new USB modem.2.4 Mbps (Down link speed) number of simultaneous users, web page accessed etc. For more details visit  http://forums.techarena.in/india-broadband/1036973.htm
with airtel u will get micromax device and at 400rs unlimited download and prepaid connection
according to my best knowledge go for airtel
Airtel is the best. It offers unlimited internet for just Rs. 400
First BSNL as theirs is affordable to common man (but bad service)
Second AirTel if u r capable of spending any amount of money (good service too)
TATA Photon is OK.
Others are not giving good service.
