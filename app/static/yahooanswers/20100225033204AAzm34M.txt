Hello LyricxTOlife,
I, too, tried poemhunter, but didn't get anywhere, either.  So, what I did was go to a library, find the
"Poetry" section, and look at the names of each publisher.  Then I wrote to as many publishers as I could (depending on whether or not I was able to find a complete address), until I started getting responses.   I finally found a publisher who was willing to take a chance on an "unknown"!!!  [...I also
tried entering several poetry contests----they are just a waste of time...]
