Do I need a terms of use or privacy policy for my website?


it depends on the material, but you should really have it for safety reasons, you never know who can be looking at your website.
Not really. If you put downloadable stuff then YES, but otherwise no
regardless if you need them or not you should put them in along with a contact page as google will not rank your site well otherwise.Hope this helps.
