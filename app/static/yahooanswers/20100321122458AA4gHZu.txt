How to get the internet domain name (internet address) that I need for my company?
I am trying to get the internet domain name/address for my company.  I looked up the .com name and it is registered to someone else.  They have not used it for their website.  I have been tracking this for over a year now and I haven't seen them do anything with the internet domain name.  Is there a way for me to get the .com that I want from them?

If you can plead your case to ICANN, then yes, you can get the domain for the standard rate; however, this is unlikely, so you should try to buy it from him. You can use a WHOIS to find him, such as www.who.is
You would have to contact them yourself, http://whois.domaintools.com/ might help you find their details.
see that website www.godaddy.com
As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. A domain name is a name you want to call your website (ex: www.yahoo.com). To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.
