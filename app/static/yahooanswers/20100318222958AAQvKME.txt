How does twitter work?
I wanna see random tweets from all over the world, but I only see tweets from people I am already following

Just look at the people you knows' friends and go from there. Celebrities also have Twitters too which is cool, but you have to make sure you find the real one and not a fake. You can search any random name and follow the person if you choose, or just look at their pages and read there tweets!
You could search a random topic in the 'search' box. There isn't really much of a way to see 'randomer' tweets.
