If I don't receive an item bought on eBay do I email the seller and ask for a refund or just open a dispute?
should i message them first? it's been 25 days...
or should i just go open a dispute with ebay/paypal?

If it has been 25 days you need to file a dispute with Paypal and E-bay. I think pay-pal has a limit for 30 days after the purchase. If you don't dispute it in 30 days, you are screwed I am pretty sure. You should of contacted the person a while ago, dispute is last action you should take, but in your case it is almost to late, so you should resort to that.
Contact them first. They may not of realized you have not received the product.

Yes contact them first & if they fail to refund or send a replacement within a reasonable timeframe, open a INR dispute through paypal & escalate to a cliam. You only have 45 days from the date that you paid to do this so keep on eye on the time
