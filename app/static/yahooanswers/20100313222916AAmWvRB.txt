What do you talk about on chatroulette?
Never used it...n Im curious to try.
Whats ur experience with it been like?...fun or unpleasant?
What on earth do u find to tlk about lol...ever have awkward lulls?
Ever ran into a celebrity?

it is a waste of time... !
but with some friends it might be fun, I acutally chat with some random people that were in my city ! that was fun, but, for real, there are some weird, i mean, really weird people who masturbates and let you see them...... thats less fun, yet suprising......

anyway, try it for fun, but i'm sure you wont make it an habit.......!
Haha, personally its a great website! 
but its only fun when your with friends, ive had random people on there... person dressed in light bulbs, devil child, freaks!
then you get other people who just sit there naked which is not that nice
we talk random stuff whatever pops into your head really & no ive never ran into a celeb, but they do go on there :)
I tried it and it was fun! The only bad side is that you don't have enough control over what you will find! I had more fun with Facebuzz.com mostly because they have a porn filter! For the rest, it's the same only a bit faster! You should try it!!
