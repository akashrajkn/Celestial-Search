Switching ISP question? ATT to Comcast?
Currently, I live in the 95121 area, using ATT DSL at 150Kb/s for $25/mo
I want to upgrade to Comcast economy high speed cable at 1Mbps for $25/mo

Now I went to the comcast website to see their services. at the bottom of the specs list, it said this is the starting price for those already subscribed to comcast's other services. But since i use ATT for phone services, I want to switch to comcast for the internet, will I be able to do this? And what does it mean by starting prices for those already subscribed, because I saw no label saying anything was the starting price, just a flat out price of 24.99/mo.

Just to get to the point, I want to switch from ATT internet to Comcast with the description from the first paragraph. Will i have problems?

You will not have a problem, You can just have the phone service with your AT&T provider, and also Comcast is good, it is the same price for pretty much x10 the speed you are getting now. Just call your AT&T provider and tell them to cancel your internet service.
