How soon does hulu add shows after they've aired on television?

The 16 and pregnant show? My family hogs the television...haha

depends on the show.  Hulu has to buy the rights to show these shows, and each show has different contract requirements, a lot of them require they wait a week after the new episode airs, while others only a day.
I have found it really depends on the show with HULU. Most of the time it's anywhere from 2 to 3 days later. On rare occasions I have seen it released the following day.
