Megaupload rally sucks sometimes, help please?
I've been downloading for 7 hours this 500 megabyte thing and suddenly I get disconnected, and since there is no pause button for free users, the download got an error. Is there anyway to download the rest of the file I'm already at 97% just about 4 megabytes I think.

Use a download manager such as flash get
next time u download only 100 mb or less because its keeps ur connection alive.. dont waste ur time on 500 mb..because i think ur internet connection speed is slow.. hope u understand
