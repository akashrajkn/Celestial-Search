what is the best web browser for windows xp?


Firefox...its simply the Best for any Windows..or even other platforms also!
Google Chrome
be it windows xp, vista, 7, mac os x 10 linux kernel 2.4.* or 2.6.* or any other x86 machine,.. 
the best browser i can say is google-chrome!

nothing can beat its simplicity and my goodness the speed!
Internet Explorer is the best suitable browser for Windows any version OS.

But, sincere suggestion is to use Mozilla Firefox to protect yourself from hackers.
Mozilla Firefox is the best for any version.
Can't go wrong with firefox or chrome.

I prefer chrome.
mozilla is best. chrome although looks simple, needs a bit more space and is deceiving so is ie.
I assume you have never tried Safari,which is the fastest web browser which is damn right Faster than Both IE and Mozilla Fire fox. It is a 10/10 when judged by speed. And even in 10 years I'd advise you to use Safari. All time Perfect!!
Apple Safari. It's Super fast.

I would say google chrome it's has a great overall base system. And it's really fast with connection of any speed.
