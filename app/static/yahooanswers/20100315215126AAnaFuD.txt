What's the best URL shortener on the web?
My personal favorite is http://rddd.it

I like rddd.it because it's the best looking URL shortening website on the web. It's got a space theme that I think works really well. Who doesn't like space, right? Which ones do you use?

Ha! You answered your own question!
Why do you even need a URL shortner?
