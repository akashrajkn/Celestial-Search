Mega Video Download, know it won't play?
I downloaded a video from mega video and it downloaded completely but know it won't play, it says it's in a MKV file if that matters, but I downloaded it twice both times I can't play it on anything?
Anyone know what's the matter/how I can fix it?
Thanks!

First, which media player do u use? Maybe your player cant support mkv format.
Try VCL or Gom player which can both play mkv files.
what's your video player?
you can try to convert MKV to other formats that your player support by using a program.
i recently found a strong power hd video converter--its WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe,it can support Multi-track HD video, such as BDAV, M2TS, MKV, AVCHD, HDTV and MPEG-TS video movies.and of course portable and console players.

hope it helps you.^-^
