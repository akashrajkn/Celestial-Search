Is there a site similar to chatroulette where you can select if you want to talk to male or female users?
Maybe even select sexuality, I never talk to guys on chatroulette and all the girls are now fatasses which is no good either. If I wanted to talk to them, I'd use IM!
I found chatremix.com but it just launched this week >.<

hum..good question! i'm not sure! I'm using Facebuzz.com and honestly i never noticed if they had the option! You could check it out!
