What are some places where you can create a Wiki absolutely free?
without having to be a member of an educational institution or studying at one. I just wana create one for an informal group of us studying something.
thanks

Take a look at MediaWiki (the software behind Wikipedia) and the requirements for it (mainly PHP, MySQL, and a web server).  If you can find a hosting service (or host it on your own server or even a desktop), it is easy to setup.
