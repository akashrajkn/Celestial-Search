Where can I find an online fake name generator?
The generator doesn't have to be limited to names; it can just be a fake text generator. However, the generator has to be free, online (i.e. no download), and the words generated have to be absolutely FAKE (i.e. no fused words, no words from another language, etc.)
I would prefer a generator that makes fake words, please. If I don't get one, then I'll choose the second guy below me as the best answer.

Here you go dude, enjoy.  Rank me well!
