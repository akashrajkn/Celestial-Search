How do I get free amazon gift cards without points2shop?
???

I use Swagbucks its much easier no offers to do or games to play just use their search engine. It's like google but you get "swagbucks" which you exchange for prizes. I got $50 in amazon gift cards in the past 2 months from them.

Edit: DON'T use lockerz, you can get points easily but they are almost never in stock and their prizes run out very quickly so it is almost impossible to get anything.
There's a place called Lockerz, and you log on every day, answer Dalies, watch Play videos, and you can earn video games, computers, gift cards, and more. FOR FREE.
(It's invite only, so if you want to join, e-mail me at puredrivelite@yahoo.com)
