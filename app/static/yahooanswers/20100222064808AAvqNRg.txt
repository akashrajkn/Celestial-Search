How do I overlap my drop down menu?
We're doing a website for a computer project.
I've already created a navigation bar.
When I mouse over the tab, a drop down menu appears.
The problem is, the drop menu appears behind the iFrame below the navigation bar.
It's like, "underlaped" instead of overlapped.
How do I solve this problem??
i saw the answer. how do I use the z-index?

try giving the menus a z-index
