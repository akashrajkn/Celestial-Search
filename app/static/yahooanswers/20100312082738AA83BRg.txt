How can I tell when my history was cleared last?
I am on a Firefox web browser and I went to check the history this morning and it is empty.  Is there a way to find out what was there or when it was last erased?

hmm.. well wait a couple of days.. find the earliest in the history list. well it was cleared right before that...!
sorry u cant :(
