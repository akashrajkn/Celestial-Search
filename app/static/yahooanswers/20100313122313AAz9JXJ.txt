It's a good Name!,
I have got more higher accounts:if intrested email
I havn't used all my accounts for around 2 years and i'm not going to as i am older and like PS3 and xBox 360 BETTER!.
I had like Level 100 and 87's, But most of them got HACKED!, and stolen of me with member!. I cannot get them back!, 
I am willing to sell my Under 40 level ones VERY cheap!
Ohh, yeh, They are HIGH skill levels aswell

Nothing, you could get all of that in an hour or two...
umm not much...plus if u could just give more specific details but i dont think its worth a lot.
well its highly against the rules setting out by jarex, so you account could be banned if you try and sell it.there is lots of sites that will review your character and they buy it and put a markup on it.
eg http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=selling+runescape+account&meta=&aq=0&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=selling+runescape+
selling accounts is againt the rules of jagex, but you could go on gold4rs.com and sell your account there. the ammount of money you would get also depends on your skill levels. hope this helped.
