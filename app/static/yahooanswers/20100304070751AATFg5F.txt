How many email addresses :?
do you have and use ?

jeez, I have like 20!! XD and use like 5. lol.
3 of them and i use all of them 
but one is for mailing my friends.
and other two are for some annonymous things like..........
Two personal.  One for business and family and friends.  One for junk mail and web sites or mailing lists I don't completely trust.

I currently don't have a work e-mail address, but usually that's a third one.

Of course, there's the Facebook, MySpace, and LiveJournal messages.  Do they count?
I have lots and lots and only use like 4.
