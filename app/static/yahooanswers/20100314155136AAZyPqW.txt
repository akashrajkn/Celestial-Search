Firefox is acting weird?
I'm trying to view a page on www.ultimate-guitar.com, but firefox refuses to load it. Does anyone know what's wrong?

It has virus on the website and firefox is blocking it
it's not FF it's the site, it must be down or closed because I just check with 3 browsers and no luck. I used FF, IE and Chrome .....no luck it's the site
