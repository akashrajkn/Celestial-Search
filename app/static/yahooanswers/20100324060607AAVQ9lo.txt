How do I get rid of this "Bing" toolbar?
Ever since then this Bing toolbar has appeared, I have received pop-ups.  How do I make the toolbar disappear?  Thanks in advance.

The popups are probabbly adware. A good antivirus will rid you of these.

You should be able to uninstall the toolbar from the windows control panel > add or remove programs.
On your internet web page go to view then Toolbars then uncheck bing.

OR you have to uninstall it from your computer C-Drive
just check out in the web browser in toolbars menu which is present in view menu........
You can uninstall it via the Control Panel (Add/Remove Programs), or directly from the browser. Also make sure you have a good antivirus that offers adware protection, like Auslogics Antivirus.
In both IE and Fire Fox go to "View" in the menu bar in the upper left hand corner click on "Toolbars" and in the drop-down box uncheck Bing Toolbar
