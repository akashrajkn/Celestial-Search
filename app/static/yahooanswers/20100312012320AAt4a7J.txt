registering for myyearbook.com?
okay so does anyone have a myyearbook? its another social networking site. well I went to sign up for one and i am over the age requirement, but it says "sorry, based on the information you provided, you are not eligible to register for myyearbook.com at this time" all of my information is the truth and it says you have to be at least 13 years of age, I'm over 13. so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. does anyone know what the problem could be? or how to contact them to ask them? 
thanks!

I used to be in the top 100 most popular users on that site,
now, it's all bogged down with advertisements.
I haven't been on there in ages.
Maybe double check your info. You might have made an error somewhere.
