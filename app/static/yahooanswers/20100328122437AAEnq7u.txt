Is this OK or this crazy?
Right since David Tennant was the new doctor, I didn't watched him until Christmas 2009/10.
I needed to watch that because his time was ENDING, but I had a little crush on him lol!! then I met the Master (John Simm) After that my mind is CRAZY! about him that night I had a dream about me and him .... IKNOW embarrasting ;( lol I need to get him out of my head ? Any help or any good films to watch so I can get over John Simm?
I don't like Big Brother lol :L      I think John is HOT. See! IM DOIng it again

You will be alright. Big Brother will be back on this summer...
