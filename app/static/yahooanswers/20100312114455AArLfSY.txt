Is ordering an item from ebay over the phone safe and following ebay rules? 10 points?
I have purchased an item over ebay, I now have to ring a number to buy my item via phone and give card details this way. The seller is a top rated seller and it seems like an actual company with open times and days. (9-5 and on a mon- tue) 
Thanks

You shouldn't have to do that to complete a transaction! That sounds very fishy to me!
Not sure why seller is asking to finish transaction over the phone.  Usually, most(80%) sellers do their transaction through PayPal. Is he based in UK?  I never had to do that.  Don't you not have an option for PayPal?  Or you don't have a PayPal account?  I always use PayPal for my own safety.
