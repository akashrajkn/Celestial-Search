Is Phonezoo really free?
usually at this moment I want free ringtones o_- 
but Im worried, that phonezoo charges on your phone bill .

It probably does.
It is free, as long as you have free media messaging(picture messaging) the only charge is the charge to recieve a picture (ringtone) message.
i use phonezoo and as long as you dont press the ones that have money prices on it they should be free. as long as you have free texting if not u will be charged for the text message but i have verizon and i use tonzr.com and it works great too and its free as long as you have texting.. just hit to send through a text message and not an mms or others
i use ventones.com, it is a real free site for ringtones.

free and safe
