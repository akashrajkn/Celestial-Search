Ideas for subdomains?
Recently Ive been `Gaming` alot and I was thinking I could do something more useful with my spare time. Last summer I worked on Subdomains and it was really fun working with it all. I made alot of fansites, stuff like that. Now that Im a year older I want to find something new to work on but im not so sure what topic I to base the `website` on. And since Im not old enough to be hired to make one for a company, thats a problem too. Im not looking for any personal `about me` websites either. Any ideas are welcome! Thank you.=)

try creating micro sites for products such as DSLR cameras, cars, or a product with a lot of features and specifications and maybe you're site will be found by these companies...

good luck
