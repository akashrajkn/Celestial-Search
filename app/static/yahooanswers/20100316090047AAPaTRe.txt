if you order something from the internet?
does the money get taken out of your bank account right away or is it only taken out once you get what you ordered????

It should be once the order is processed. Then again sometimes it depends on the site your ordered from.
the places i order from bills me when the product ships out of their warehouses.
it is taken out right away if you use a visa/mastercard
it may take a while for them to take the money if you use a debit card through paypal
but in most instances the money is instant
It depends on Company policy. Some companies take the money out straight away and some take the money after posting the item (good practice). 

So it depends on the company you are dealing with. But for sure you can't stop the payment once you give your debit/credit card details to them.
