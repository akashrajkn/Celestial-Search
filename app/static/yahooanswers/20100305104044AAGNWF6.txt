He has no pitty for all the peaple he scammed and or tried to scam and wil lcontinue to do so so i have no pitty either.

You don't get a reward but you can report them to the FBI Internet Crime reporting site http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx and to Craigslist, as well as the ISP of their email address. If they arent in the US, which they normallly aren't, nothing will happen. The police or FBI are not going after Nigerian or Russian scammers pulling car scams from overseas
For some reason (maybe someone else knows for sure), many scammers sell goods below $5000, regardless of value. I've baited a few selling heavy equipment, like tractors - also on Ebay.
I suspect it has something to do with the sum of money, being tracked or if certain countries have to report sums larger than $5000. Or, it may be a difference between  a "serious crime" vs a misdemeanor in the court's eye if caught.
Some of these scammers are not too bright, their story is always the same - they are out of the country, the goods are already packaged for shipping (so you can't view it), etc. I had one on Ebay, selling a tractor for $4400, and he included the serial number. I searched the internet, and found the same tractor in Wisconsin, selling for $44,000 - even the same picture!!! I asked the seller, how he got the tractor from Wisconsin to Vancouver - and mysteriously his ad disappeared within minutes...
It's a good thing people aren't so easily fooled!
