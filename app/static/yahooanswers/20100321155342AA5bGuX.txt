Where can I watch TV/movies online for free, good quality, no surveys?
I would like to watch Iron man 2 or the new Harry Potter movie online (I KNOW THEY AREN'T OUT YET!)  for free without doing any surveys
I found a site to watch Iron man 2 but I had to do a survey and when I finished it it said I hadn't finished it...
Anyways I would like to watch these movies or The Lovely Bones online, good quality, no surveys, and if at all possible, without breaking any serious laws

Hulu is a great site for watching TV shows and movies, if you can deal with 15-1m commercials.
abc.com, google watch t.v. online.
Where do you think the money to make movies comes from?
It is the money from sales (DVD's etc.) of current movies that provides the money to make new movies.
If people are watching online - instead of buying them - there soon wont be any new movies being released, because there'll be no money to make them.
These movie streaming sites are totally unauthorized and possibly totally bogus

Have fun!
A good website is movies-links.tv or watch movies.net. They have both the new harry potter and iron man and they may or may not have good quality( depends on how long they movies have been out for) No surveys. Good luck :)

Best site in my opinion:
A lot of new movies are on this site but you can also find all the classics. Also many movies that are now airing in theaters, can be found here. You can watch different TV shows as well on the same website for free. Movies are full length and high quality. Site is free to use and virus free. You have the option to just watch them or if you want, download them. Hope this helps you! Enjoy!
