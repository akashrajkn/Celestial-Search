Why does AOL.com always launch when i open up AIM?
Everytime i open up AIM it launches the internet and goes to AOL.com. Can anyone tell me how to fix this because it is getting very irritating.

Sure, When you open click on menu>settings>Sign In & Sign Out> and you will see "When signing in display the following: Welcome page and none. Click on None and save.

If you can become a member that would be great as well
Menu -> Settings -> Sign In/Sign Out -> click none
you can also use F7 to get to settings
