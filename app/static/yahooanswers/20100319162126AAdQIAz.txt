I need help with a Firefox problem?
I have Firefox 3.6 and I have the Smart Bookmarks Bar add-on and it doesn't work on the initial start-up. I have to go to tools>add-ons>find updates>then restart firefox for it to work.

Things I have tried:
1. reinstall Smart Bookmarks Bar
2. reinstall Firefox 3.6

Thanks.
