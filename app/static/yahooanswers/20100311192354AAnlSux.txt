What do you think of MLIA (my life is average)?
I think its funny but too many harry potter, fort building six year old stories.  I mean those stories are funny at first but sometimes MLIA seems to repeat itself with those stories.

I liked it, but it got soooo repetitive.
I rather read texts from last night.
Its ok
Yeah I agree with you. I use to read it a lot, but now I prefer FML (fmylife.com) cause its more entertaining. MLIA is all about Harry Potter, Ninjas, etc, and doesn't really portray "Average" lives anymore; there are only a few good ones I really like. Once in a while I'll take a look, but every time I mainly see the same stuff. 

:D
i LOVE MLIA!! <3 <3
