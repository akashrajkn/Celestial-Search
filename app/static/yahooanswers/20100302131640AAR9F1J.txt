Chat Roulette won't let me click on the little agreement box because of Adobe Flash Player?
I tried to go on the chatroulette website, but when I click 'start', there's a little agreement box that asks you to click accept / deny, but it won't let me click either.
I downloaded the latest version of Adobe Flash Player, but it didn't do anything.
What can I do to make this work?
Thanks in advance.
OK THANKS, 
it appears on other websites, too.

it's probably better that way. i tried chatroulette and it's like 90% random penises...not very appealing to me.
