Firefox wont open for me?
Whenever I try to open Firefox it says "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." 
Firefox isn't open, and I don't see why that matters anyway as you can have multiple windows open...
I have tried going to Processes on Task Manager and trying to end any firefox related processes, but there wasn't anything there anyway.
What can I do? I'm using SeaMonkey at the moment and it's awful (mainly because who likes change??)
I have tried re-starting my computer.
