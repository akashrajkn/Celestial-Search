Why doesn't sound work on firefox?
It worked a few days ago.  Explorer works just fine.

sorry to sound a bit basic but just to be sure!... have you checked (if you use vista or 7) that firefox is turned up in the volume mixer!

Good luck
make sure your applications (like firefox) have access to sound
