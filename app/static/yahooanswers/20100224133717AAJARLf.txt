What is Lockerz? 
Lockerz is an invitation-only worldwide community where members can find entertainment, shopping, and a full social network all on one website. 
Members are rewarded for almost everything they do on the site! 
Whether it's buying a cool new brand, watching a video, playing a game, answering a daily question or even just logging in. 
There are currently about 5 ways to earn PTZ (Points), which is the currency on Lockerz. 
As you accumulate PTZ you will be able to redeem them at the PTZ Place, their online shopping mall. 
The PTZ place has thousands of prizes ranging from electronics, designer clothing, sports equipment, and so much more!
