I wanted to know a good online calendar which i can use to manage my activities, including everything from entertainment to things i do in work..something i can use for all my activities.. I tried 30boxes, google calendar, most of the main and most popular calendars, but i could not find anything really to my needs. Can anyone advise on any online calendar which proposes something different to suit my needs?

If you are a gmail user, gmail features Calender, which is pretty good.
best is google calendar
GOOKSUGAR is the best Online Calendar which I have used. I am sure you also will be comfort with this. For Online Calendar visit

I use Reqall.
I tried calopi.com and really liked it..you should give it a try if you want something new.

Its one the best i've used...it has many features that might be of interest to you, like task management, todo lists, views (this one is really very useful), reports, sharing with friends and also a forum if you want more specific functionalities

last thing, there's quite a unique feature in the website called spot me which is like a google desktop/spotlight feature..its very helpful to find/open something quickly
