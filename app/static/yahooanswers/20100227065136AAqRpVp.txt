Any good social networking sites?
I'm looking for a social networking site. Maybe one that's not so popular as facebook, or myspace or whatever. I'm looking for one where you can meet new people instead of websites where there are people you know. :') If anyone could find me one that would be great. ^^ Maybe one like vampirefreaks or something like that, with a smaller community. ^^ Thanks.

Why not try Twitter.com?
Yeah, it's called GoOutside.
