Are you using the 64-bit edition of Internet explorer? If so, try using the 32-bit. If that's not the case, then you may want to test and make sure, java, flash, and cookies are all working properly. If all else failes, download and install firefox.

thats a pretty common fault with internet explorer, use google chrome it is much faster and much more reliable
