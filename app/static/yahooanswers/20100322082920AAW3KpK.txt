when will i recieve my prize from prizerebel?
i claimed my prize from prize rebel on wednesday. today is now Monday and i was wondering will i receive my prize today. this is my first time claiming something from prize rebel. its yugioh card. so my question is when will i receive my prize and will a truck carrier bring it or will it come in the mail.

It depends on what kind of prize you ordered.

If it was from Ebay, it would have probably told you when it would arrive.

Other than that it takes 7-14 business days.
It's free. You have to pay the $89.95 shipping and handling charge first, preferably by sending them a check made out to 'cash'.
Cruise is right, though your prize could be delayed by the backlog of prize claims accumulated over the weekend. PR employees do not answer claims until Monday morning EST, and I've noticed the claims taking longer recently (possibly due to increased popularity). You'll receive the card in one or two weeks once the claim is accepted. 

Steam game claims are usually answered quickly, and I made one on Thursday. I'll give you a heads up (in an edit) if it credits. That should give you a rough idea of when you'll be answered. Good luck! Kudos for sticking with PR longer than 99% of my referrals. ^_^
