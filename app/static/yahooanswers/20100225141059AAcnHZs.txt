Sounds that make dogs excited?
I need to find some sounds that make dogs excited but i can't seem to find any. Its just that my dog seem bored but nothing seems to cheer him up and I was hoping some sounds for dogs would help.
Preferably something I don't have to buy and can listen to with my dog for free. And something I can listen to on my computer
can anyone help?

Dogs are predators and, by nature, can be excited by the sound(s) of prey animals (rabbits, mice, etc.) - especially such animals in distress. That's why squeak toys are so popular for dogs. They mimic the sound of a small animal screaming for it's life. They are also excited by the sound of other dogs.

You can probably find different animal sounds, including birds, dogs growling, small animal calls through a web search.  Search for sound effects or animal sounds.
