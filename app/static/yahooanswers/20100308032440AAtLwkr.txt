Install Malwarebytes free from http://www.download.com and then do a scan with it to fix the problem
Find porn sites that won't lead you to viruses
you gor spammed dude! i suggest u install a free spam/spyware remover application called Microsoft Security Essentials from the Microsoft website. it's free! If u have one then scan your computer for potential threats.
i highly recommend using Spybot http://www.safer-networking.org/
You probably have some icky malware on your PC... Do a free scan from somewhere like Norton or Mcafee.... Also run a full virus scan
Download antimalware from:

http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html

Install...
Update...

Full Scan of Computer and restart pc

and repeat until no threats found...

If you are repeating more then 3 times scan in safe mode...

If you cant install the software...

Restart computer in Safe mode with Networking and follow steps above...
