Where can i watch 'The Pacific' online and for free and without having to do those annyoing questionaires?
Ive had a look but it seems that i have to do those annoying questionaires. I'd like to watch episodes 1 & 2 thanks in advance :D

It isn't stealing if you pay for Cable/Satellite! I missed the first episode... So I DL'd it because I'm already throwing cash at HBO and they can blow me if they get mad that  am getting content that I already paid for.
You can watch it online at http://www.watchtp.com/ there is no surveys to fill out.
