is it possible to change my twitter username without making a new account and losing all my followers?


yes.

You go into account details and there you can keep the same real name but change your profile name or you can change both.

ie. you can chage it to:
Name: Katherine
Profile name: Kathy


This way you keep your name so people can find you but you can change the name that appears on your profile.
Yeah. I've done that before, but after you change it, send a tweet out that you've changed your name from whatever it used to be to your new username, otherwise your followers will be like 'Who the heck is this?'
Find "settings" in the menu bar at the top of your page.  Where it says "Username" you can erase your current username and enter a new one (so long as it's not already taken).  As far as I know, that doesn't alter your account or followers at all.
Yup, you go to Settings> Account, and in the 'Username' box, you type in what you want your username to be, and click on 'Save' at the bottom.
