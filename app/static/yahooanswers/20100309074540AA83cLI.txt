is www.listia.com a scam, or do you really get the stuff you win?


I use it all the time, I have always gotten everything I have won, you can look at the sellers rating to see whats been said about them, also if you do not get your item they will return your credits to you, no cash is exchanged unless it states you pay shipping. Hope that helps
try checking ripoff report & complaints board too ...
