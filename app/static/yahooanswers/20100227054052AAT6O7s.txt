Any good free blog sites?
I'm looking to start writing my own blog and wondering whats the best website to start off with and got alotta viewers?

(I plan to do reviews so if theirs a website that focus's on that purely then I would prefer that)

wordpress maybe
Wordpress.com, it's free, it's simple, and has many themes to choose from. Also, during Christmas, you can make snow float down your blog!
