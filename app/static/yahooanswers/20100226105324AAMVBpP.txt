Why is 4od (internet video streaming service) so jumpy?
I am trying to watch a programme on Channel 4's catch up system on their website, 4od. Every 5 seconds or so the video and audio stop for a few seconds then start again, making the programme unwatchable. Why is this and what can I do to stop it?

I think it's something to do with it being really slow at loading, cos it happens to me loads too. I just pause it at the very beginning, and go make a cup of tea or something, and then come back and watch it in about 10 minutes, it usually works.
Hope this helps! :)
