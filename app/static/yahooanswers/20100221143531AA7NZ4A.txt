Yahoo Sports prize? Is it a scam?
I often look at the headlines on yahoo.  Sometimes they take me to yahoo sports and sometimes a webpage comes up that says I've won a free prize or something like that and it gives me about 2 minutes  to claim he prize.  The prizes are an option of 2 dell notebooks, a 1000$ best buy gift card, or a 1000$ walmart gift card.  My question is is it a scam?  I think it is and I haven't clicked on anything I always exit but... I wanna know for sure?

Yes.
Almost every popup that ever comes up will be a link to a scam or virus.
Just get a popup blocker, so you only allow popups you want, because some sites pop up stuff in new windows.
These "free" items are not so free.

They are free when you complete a program that involves buying other things and putting your credit card information as well as house address and telephone number out there for people to see.

If you complete the terms of the offer exactly as described, you will receive the item at no additional cost, but you would have already spent more money than the item is worth and the company sells your information to advertisers, leading to more BS.

Just leave this stuff alone.  Its not worth the hassle.
These are all scams, dont click on them.They all ask for a processing fee, but there is no prize, then you keep getting tons of spam with other prizes, all asking for more money. Walmart even says they dont do these gift cards and on the news last week there was some free iPhone contest that over 500,000 people registered for with credit card details for 'shipping' and all had their cards fraudulently charged by someone in Nigeria
