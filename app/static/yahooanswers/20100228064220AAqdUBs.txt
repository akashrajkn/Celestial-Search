So people can create web sites where other people ask totally vague questions like this one. or questions that require an essay for an answer. Or questions where the answer should be really, really obvious.
The original idea of the World Wide Web was for military use. Then it expanded to business and home to provide information to it's users. Over time, it has evolved into much, much more - and now can be a very powerful tool in good ways.... and not so good ways!
It is to have fun.
Hmmmm.......   Maybe to look at this stupid question
The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known as The Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents contained on the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them by using hyperlinks. Using concepts from earlier hypertext systems, British engineer and computer scientist Sir Tim Berners Lee, now the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web.[1] He was later joined by Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau while both were working at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1990, they proposed using "HyperText [...] to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will",[2] and released that web in December.[3]

>>>>>>>>"The World-Wide Web (W3) was developed to be a pool of human knowledge, which would allow collaborators in remote sites to share their ideas and all aspects of a common project." [4] If two projects are independently created, rather than have a central figure make the changes, the two bodies of information could form into one cohesive piece of work.<<<<<<<<<<<
