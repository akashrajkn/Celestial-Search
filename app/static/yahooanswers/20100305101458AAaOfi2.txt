Okay so on the heart symbol you press alt and then 3? And if that is tru, I try doing that and the heart wont show up? Weird, ay. Can you help?

You have to hold alt and then press 3 on the number pad.
Make sure that you are using Microsoft Windows, otherwise you need to use other methods

Make sure that Num Lock is on.

Hold down the left Alt key.

Type 3 on the numeric keypad. The 3 on the numeric row of keys will not work.

Release the left Alt key.

On a lap tap, you may have to press the Fn key to help turn Num Lock on and press the Fn key before pressing the key which will provide you with a numeric keypad 3. Check your lap top documentation for details on this. Some lap tops do it differently and a few cannot do it.

Make sure you do not have a utility running that might interfere with your normal keyboard functions.

Also try Alt 1, Alt 2, Alt 4 and so forth. Every value from Alt 1 to Alt 255 should give a different character, after which the sequence will repeat. The character corresponds to its position in your current 8-bit DOS character set. If you type a 0 in front of the number, you will instead get the character with that number in your current 8-bit Windows character set.
