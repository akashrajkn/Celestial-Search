If you create a twitter account - does the whole world have to see it and your profile?
i'm a newb when it comes to these social networking sites (myspace, facebook, twitter etc )

i have a rough idea as to what they're all about, and so forth but I was wondering how much privacy and anonimity you could have should you wish to remain unsearachable by complete and total strangers.

secondly is it compulsory to upload a photograph of yourself in the profile sections of these sites ?

one of the reasons I don't upload anything about my life on the internet is simply because - I don't trust the vast majority of people who gain access to the internet and do god knows what with your personal profile info,  photos, movies etc.

i'm confident and pretty certain that average internet user uploads/provides enough personal information about themselves online, for any external entity out there to find - arrange into a way as to build a complete and accurate character of oneself.

i wish to consider creating a 'twitter' account now - but only so that close trustees and family can gain access to it and view it and share information with me.

nobody else.

can this be done ?
