Google AdSense & Chitika?
Using Google AdSense and Chitika to place ads on my site, how much can I expect to earn from each visitor?

I have to make a budget on my income, and I have no idea how big of a difference e.g. 1 000, 10 000 or 100 000 visitors will make for the income.

The site is not launched yet and has a low budget, so I guess we'll start at the bottom of the hierarchy (if that makes any sense...)

it depend on your vistor ho much you get traffic at your website.If  so many visitor come at your website then you get good income through google adsense.
it depens upon numer of factors 
like how much visitors visit ur website per day
how many  click on ads (normally )10-15% of total traffic
from where ur visitors cum like usa ,india .....
what is the alexa and page rank of website
in starting forget u will be able to get even worth ur hosting plan belive me until u have done good seo on ur website
You will not make money on each visitor... the volume of your income will depend on your traffic volume. Typically the AdSense & Chitika conversion for a startup website is about .30% (in my experience) .. that means that if you get 1000 visitors you could get about 300 click .. and if each click pays about .05 / click .. you make about 15$ / day...
