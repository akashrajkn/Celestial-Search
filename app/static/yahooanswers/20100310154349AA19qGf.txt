How do I unhide the Menu etc. bars in Firefox after I've hidden them all?
I have the latest version of Firefox and I hid all of the bars above tabs thinking I could reverse it easily, but now I realize I can't.

I right-clicked everywhere on the tabs bar and the window including the bottom, but the right-click menu only has options about tabs...

I want to avoid having to reinstall Firefox, so do any of you know what I should do?
Thanks, that was quick! +1

Press ALT + V ( both keys together) 

When the menu bar comes up , select View >.Toolbars>. and double click on Menu Bar until the tick appears next to it

Or are you in Full Screen Mode ?..If so press F11 to return to normal
^ Thank you, that was a life saver. =)

(I did the same thing lol).
