Blog Question: Posts number?
So every time I write a new post on my blog, I will put the title according to the number of that post. For example: the 310th post will become "310."
Now I've moved my blog to a new site..
and I currently have about 27 posts there..
what do you think?
can I add 310 and 27 together.
and start posting 337. and so on?
Do you feel cheated?..lol random question XD

Doesn't seem unreasonable to me, since all 337 posts are still readable.
