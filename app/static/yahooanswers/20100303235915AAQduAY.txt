some sites can't open !!?
some of the sites can't open (problem from the router) but other sites work normally because when i try those sites on my laptop on another router they open normally
do u know why???

SO, what was your question?
Either these sites are blocked by the filter on the router or the nameserver that this router uses has blocked these sites.

You may try opening the admin panel and see if any sites are blocked. If this is a router at work, there is a fair chance that this is indeed the case.
