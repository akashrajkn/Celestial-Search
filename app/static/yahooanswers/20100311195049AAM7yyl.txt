is this site bogus or real?
is cash crate's website real or a hoax? has anyone earned a pay check?

It's real but very tricky.  Along with filling out a series of surveys, you will be asked to receive gifts for a fee which you may not have intended to purchase. They appear as "trial" offers which if you are not a good bookkeeper and fail to unsubscribe to the offer in time; will result in you having to pay for the whole subscription. That's the trickery aspect of cashcrate. You will be bombarded with endless spam freebie offerings which you initially tried to offset by providing incorrect or phoney email addresses. And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new unsuspecting candidates into this program. So, if you do not want to keep strict track of such offerings and do not have others to recommend, then the overall pay per hour [$1.49] for all your survey taking may prove to be of little value [for all your efforts]. For those so-called cashcrate proponents that say that they have earned some $300 a month from cashcrate; what did they spend towards those special gift offerings along the way ... probably a lot or are they really attempting to attract unsuspecting new candidates by making false claims that they too can earn astronomical earnings. 

Good luck!
