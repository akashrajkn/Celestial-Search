What exactly is lockerz.com about?
How do you get invited to it?

You simply ask someone to invite you :p
You can pm me your email and I'll invite you.

Best regards,

Lockerz is a site where you get points for doing the easiest of tasks; there is no need to doubt the site because I personally have already received a Z-List T-shirt and a Nintendo Wii.
