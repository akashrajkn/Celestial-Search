What is so good about twitter?
I presently have facebook, which I love; I have tried twitter once, but it seemed very boring. What makes twitter so interesting? and why would it be better than other social networking sites like facebook?

I like to read the celebrity tweets.  Not so much just reg ppl.

Luckily I can sync my Myspace updates with Twitter so my ppl think I am updating all the time and I am really only updating Myspace lol.
Twitter and Facebook are basically the same.
All they are is reading peoples status.
This is the thing.
1 best is Myspace becasue it has everything from music,Customization,STATUS's,messeges, comments and so on.
2 best is Facebook,Its has messeging,statuses and funny fan pages.
3 best is Twitter it only has status's.
i agree with eric the only thing interesting is reading the celeb tweets, cus at least you can sit there and listen to their slightly more interesting lives. For the vast majority i don't see how tweeting is really that interesting as i don't really need to know if my friends are making cups of tea or just nip to the shop for a drink.

Stephen Fry's tweets are usually pretty insightfull.
nothing much, you can "follow" famous celebrities around and find out what they are doing :)
