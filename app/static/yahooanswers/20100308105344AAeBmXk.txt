Paypal ...money order?
Hi I would like to take money from my paypal account which is linked to my moms credit card and get some cash in hand today or asap. My mom's at the hospital so I she can't do anything. I do not have a bank account so just rule that out okay. What I'm looking to do for example is western union myself the money and pay for it using paypal (except western union doesnt do that.) nor does moneygram. Does anyone know of a service where I can pay online and pickup @ the store? I really just need a few things from the grocery. I'd even buy a safeway gift card or something of that nature online but I cant wait for anything in the mail either so please don't suggest that. Online service, pay with paypal ----> receive cash in hand... thoughts?
Well I'm trying to be as honest as I can. I assure you the paypal account is mine. And thanks for the answer - dick.

This just doesn't sound legit.  It sounds more like you've accessed someones paypal account (possibly your mom's) and are trying to steal.
