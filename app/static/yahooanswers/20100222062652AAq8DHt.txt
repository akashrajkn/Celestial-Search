Can bad weather cause internet issues?
It's snowing really bad in michigan, and my Dsl modem light keeps turning red at random times and turning back green. It just startedd doing this today.
 
So is the weather the cause of my modem problem? and if it is, when will it starting acting normal again?

Yes, severe weather can cause service issues, especially in Northern areas during winter.

This isn't to say that you couldn't have something else going on.


Given that the problem is between the modem and the CO, it's likely weather related.
