What exactly is Skype?
...and would you recommend it?

Its a free service that allows free video and voice conversations to any other skype user you have added. (no strangers if you don't want it) I use it all the time to talk to my cousins and Uncle in America its a really good progarame to have and I highly recomend it.
it's a program that lets you talk to other ppl
yes, you should get it
basically its internet calling, so instead of using your normal home phone you use the internet connection and call trhough the computer, yeah i would cuz free. there's companies which also use skype as the normal phone, so you use the normal home phone which uses internet connection like skype, and this is very cheap, we have it ourselves, its exactly like normal phone except cheap.
