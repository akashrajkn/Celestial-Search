how can adjust how to save downloads on firefox?
Whenever I download files in the past from firefox, it prompts me to either Save or Open. now i can only save my files which has a small hassle to it because I have to do that extra step of of extracting is need be.   im using OSX. thanks

My goodness, it always amazes me how some people can be so oblivious

In firefox, Click Tools>Options

Go to the "General" tab, and select "Save files to". Specify a folder, and voila
