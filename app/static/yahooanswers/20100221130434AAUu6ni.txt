Urgent blogging question? Help needed?
I'd like to start a blog, but I want a blog service that will give me the option of making entries private and public. I tried blogger and you can either go public or private, cannot have both; unless there is something I miss. Please let me know. Thanks

Check the link towards the bottom right side under Privacy and see if that is what you prefer or not...
http://www.blogunexpected.com is a great site that can answer all of those questions.  There is actually a list of domains that will guide you to setting up the blog.
