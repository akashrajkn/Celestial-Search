What are the best firefox add ons?
I want to know what are some cool firefox add ons?

some of my favorites are :

personas:http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/

tip, if you hover your cursor over a persona, you can test it before you download it.


adbockplus:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

it allows you to block those stupid " shoot the ninja and win a free ipod animations until you click on them.

here is the same thing but it blocks flash adds until you click on them.  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433

feel free to contact me via email or IM if you need help or have any questions(:

have a nice day
if you use forums try RoboForm
