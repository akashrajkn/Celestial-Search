What is www. and http:// for?
You can still visit a website with or without it. Right?
What is its use?

world wide web and HyperText Transfer Protocol i think
http = hyper text transfer protocol. It tells the server you are connecting to that you are requesting a document.

www = world wide web.

You need them. Although most browsers will automatically add them for you when you try to connect if you dont type it in.
www-World Wide Web
Http-hypertext transfer protocol
www stands for world wide web.
Its currently used to tell the web server to use its primary domain

http stands for hypertext transfer protocol, it is the protocol used to send these web pages from the web server to your computer. 

There are other protocols also such as https (encrypted version of http), ftp (transferring files), and much more.
