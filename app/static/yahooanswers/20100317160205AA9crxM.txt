Will GMX mail remain free?
http://gmx.com/

Probably as if they began charging they would loose business to hotmail, yahoo ect.
So it makes sense to keep it free, maybe offering a premium package if necessarry.
Don't know but I only use it for file storage/ sharing and to access multiple email accounts. If they start charging for it I'll use something else instead!
Thanks for asking, I was wondering the same thing! I have a Hotmail account currently, but I use GMX for work. I think it will- but I don't recommend it. When I use GMX it's very slow and the setup and look of the inbox is very different and complicated. I would use Hotmail. Hotmail has 2GB storage, and it's free, and, also, if you have a Windows 7 computer like me, you can hook up your e-mail to make things more compatible on your PC. =D I hope this answer really helps. I hope I've met your requirements for a good answer. Have a nice day!
