I got a new computer.  How do I get my iTunes music back?
I just got a new computer.  I had a bunch of songs on iTunes that I had purchased over the last few years.  My old comp. died, so there is no retrieving there.  Is there any way to get my purchased music back?

if music on you ipod/iphone/itouch , you can get it all back. try this one:

it can copy all the music from ipod/iphone/itouch to local pc. so you do not need your old computer.
hope it helps for you
