What is a 'Tumblr Crush'?
Pretty much what the question asks. I have a Tumblr account, but I often hear people saying stuff about having a 'Tumblr Crush'. I have no idea what that is, can anyone explain what it is and how I can find it out or whatev? Thank you :)

in tumblr you have the option to live a photo (the little heart) 
A tumblr crush is the person whose photos you've like the most.
