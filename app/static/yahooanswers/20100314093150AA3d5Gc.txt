On play.com, if a seller refunds you for an item brought does the money go back into your bank account?
brought an item, and decided didn't actually need it so the seller said she will refund me

will the money go back into my bank account or in my play.com account?

thanks

When you get a refund, it is almost always returned to you in the exact same manner as you paid for it.

So, in this case, if you paid using your play.com account, then you probably will see your refund on your play.com account. If you paid using a credit card, you will see the refund on your credit card statement.

If you paid using a debit card, the refund will go into your bank account.

Hope that helps!
