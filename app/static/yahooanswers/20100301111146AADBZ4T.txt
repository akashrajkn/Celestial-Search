Can you buy straight out on Ebay or do you always have to make a bid?
I really need to buy Forever stamps, the liberty bell ones, for a self addressed stamped envelope. The USPS aren't currently taking orders outside of the U.S. I live in Ireland., Ebay is another option but I don't wanna have to bid on them, do you always have to bid or can you just buy it straight out????

it depends on the seller. they have to make the "buy it now" option available, otherwise you do have to bid
Seans answer is correct. Also check the seller. See how many negatives they have. You can never be too carefull with them.

No can do. The US post offices does NOT sell stamps outside the US except at an authorized agent of the USPS. Which means there is NO ONE on Ebay selling stamps unless it is a collector and then you will be paying much higher than face value. Which I suppose you COULD do to get postage stamps which are not already canceled with a postmark. Time to check with your local post office and check on International Reply Coupons (IRC). I believe an IRC allows you to pay return postage through reciprocal agreements between your post office and the US post office. In essence, at the US end, the IRC allows the US post office to bill your post office for the postage which you paid in advance at your end.
