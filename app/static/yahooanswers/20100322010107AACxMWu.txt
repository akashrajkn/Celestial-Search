How do I access this wireless internet?
How do I access my schools wifi, 
I think they use a VPN server http://vpn-1.elthamcollege.vic.edu.au
I have filled everything out in the VPN settings I just don't know the secret/

Whats the secret?

Thanks,

Oh and the schools network is called EW and is unsecured

It must be protected by a password, likely you cannot access. check with the school personnel, don't try hacking.
