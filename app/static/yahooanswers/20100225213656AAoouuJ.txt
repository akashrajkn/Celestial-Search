Internet Explorer problems. no sound etc?
ive been having a problem with my internet explorer. i cant hear any sounds online, but on google chrome i can. i can only log in on certain social networking sites. but this is also a problem on google chrome.  what is the problem. other wise everything works great, but i dont get sound and i cant log in on certain sites.


i dont think i have a virus. anyone?

If Chrome works, who cares about Internet Explorer.
