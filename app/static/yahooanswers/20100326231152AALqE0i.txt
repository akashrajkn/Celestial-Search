What happens if you buy something on eBay and don't pay for it?
I bought some retarded wooden box from some company or someone in Japan. I ended up winning the bid for $6.99. I bid on it in the middle of the night and idk what I was thinking but it's ugly as heck and shipping on it is absolutely ridiculous! Super high! I know it's my fault for doing it in the first place, so no lectures please. But I won the bid a couple days ago and still haven't paid for it....What happens if I just don't?

They'll give you negative feedback for not paying of course. You possibly could be fined as well.

Just pay for the item & avoid possible legal hassles.

DISCLAIMER - I'm not a lawyer, I'm just using my experience with ordering items through mail & the Internet over the years.
You will definitely get negative feedback, which is never a good thing unless you have like 12,565 feedback because instead of 100% it would look something like 98.7% or 99.9%. You could have your account suspended also if you don't pay. Just talk to the seller about it and see if they will allow you to do a bid retraction and avoid any problems.
the 1st & 2nd answers are incorrect

Contact the seller & ask to withdraw from the sale. They dont have to agree to this, if they dont agree they will open a non paying bidder dispute & if it remains unpaid will issue you a strike. This could restrict you in the future re bidding/selling. Get 3 strikes & ebay will terminate your account.

Sellers cannot give neg feedback to buyers anymore. 

No lectures I promise but as a ebay seller myself, it takes time & money to list things then to have someone change their mind for whatever reason its a bit annoying. Anyway just communicate with the seller, they may just cancel the sale, with no penalty to you.
JAPANESE BOX!!! And you laugh at me for wanting to get vintage toys?? JAPANESE BOX???!?!?!  Really??!
