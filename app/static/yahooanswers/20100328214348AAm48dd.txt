How may I find out how much time I spend on the internet?


time yourself from start to finish
A watch
A clock
A timer
A nagging Wife (she will let you know)

So many ways.
Use Google to find a free program called "Networx".  
Download it, install it (it's completely safe) and just relax while Networx does the timing for you.  

I used it a great deal before buying a mobile broadband USB stick, to help me decide which broadband package I would be better off paying for, related to my existing usage.
The easiest way is to make an observation of the clock on your computer when you begin your session.
