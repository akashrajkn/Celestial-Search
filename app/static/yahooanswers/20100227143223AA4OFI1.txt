what is the best category to put this story I made up on fanfiction?
I made up a story and I would really like to post it on fanfic. It is based on Real life, but I made up the names. It has nothing to do with TV shows or books. What category would fit this? Thanks. (:

If it has nothing to do with any movies, TV shows, or books, then it's not a fan fiction story. It's just a story. (See definition of fanfiction in Sources)
There are websites where amateur writers can post general stories, but I don't know where those are. Ask in the Books & Authors category here where you can post stories online.
