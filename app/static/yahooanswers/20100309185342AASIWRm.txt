Can you use Remote Assistance on XP to help someone using windows 7?
I have an Xp. My grandparents just got a 7... they know nothing about computers.. they had to ask how to shut it down. can you do Remote Assistance from Xp to 7?
For the smart people who cant figure this out... my grandparents dont live in the same city as me... or even the same state.

Perhaps you could go upstairs/downstairs to the room their computer is in and just help in-person?
Yes.
yes you can,

ask your grandparent click start button( bottom left round button ) the shutdown button is at the bottom right of the start menu.

if you want to do remote assistance, click the search line at the bottom of the start menu ( beside the shutdown button ) and type 'remote'

the result will show at the top portion of the search screen. then click on remote assistance.
