How do I build my own web site?
Whats a good starter software package for this?

Try : http://www.webs.com/
Depends on how much work you want to put into it. You can look into free web hosts or Post 2 host
you can make free website by WWW.webs.com (it will require free registration) and you can upload your data or html file or also webs.com has inbuilt website creator which can help you.
Then you would want to get your domain and so go to http://www.freedomain.co.nr/  which will guide you through the process . May be this video will help you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ5fq44Il2k .
