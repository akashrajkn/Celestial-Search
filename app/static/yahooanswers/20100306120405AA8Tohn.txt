Did I lose my money on paypal? PLEASE HELP, Especially people with experience with paypal & ebay...?
I think I might have lost $50 on paypal :\ I sold something on ebay, The money went in to my paypal account, I then transferred it to my bank account, It didn't show in my bank account so I panicked. Then I added funds from the bank to my paypal again to see if it goes back there. And now it's say Processing. What does processing? this has never happened before? HELP I'm scared...... Did I lose my money??????????????

It takes about 4-5 days to go from paypal to bank account.. if you did that, but then transferred it back, once the money gets there, it will just come right back now...lol.
I think you should contact PayPal immediately!
it takes a few days for money to be transferred from your bank into your paypal
Paypal does things their own way.  There could be a number of reasons that what you described happened.  The only way to find out is to ask.  Email customer support at Paypal.
I can see you panicked. (I hate PayPal!) What you did was first send the money from PayPal to your account, and the transaction completes in for 4-5 days, then you sent money from your bank account to your PayPal account, and this transaction also completes in 4-5 days. The money will appear in your bank account momentarily in 4-5 days and then shortly after $50 will be sent from your bank account to PayPal. I think you can call PayPal to cancel the transaction if you do not want to waste time waiting.
Some transfers can finish after 3-4 days. 
Maybe your in this group.
Don't be afraid.
Best regards
