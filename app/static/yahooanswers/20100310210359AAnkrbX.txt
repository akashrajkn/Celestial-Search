Question about tabs (Mozilla Firefox)...?

Looking at the picture, please note that the tab boxed in red is a newly opened one. So how do I, when I press "Open in New Tab" (like in the Yahoo! page visible in the picture), make the tab always go to the end rather than in between?

The tabs used to open like that actually, but the newer Firefox version has changed that feature because it was commonly requested. BUT...

You can fix it so that it goes back to the old way, just add this extension:
