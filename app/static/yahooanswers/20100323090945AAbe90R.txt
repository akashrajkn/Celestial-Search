What do you think about Twitter?


Its okay. All it is, is a status updating website. Most phones have the application now a days after it got really popular over the last year.  Twitter is just a more simpler version of FaceBook.
I don't give a Tweet!
Its good but with uncertain future.
I think it's silly and unnecessary, but sometimes reading them can be fun. Like I've read a few of Conan's that made me laugh. And I look at Post Secret tweets. Those are pretty interesting.
I think its fastest growing micro blog in the world if it keep spreading the way its doing it may bit the facebook or any social network in next 3 Years. I love twitter and love getting more followers.
it's really nice and addictive after you find friends and it's waaay much better than Facebook or whatever
