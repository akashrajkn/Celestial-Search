on skype...do i have to buy skype credis even to make the free calls?
I signed up for it, now i want to see who else is on skype but i cant seem to even get into the screen that is shown in all the tutorial. The one with your pic and info and options and such. Am I just missing it?

To make calls to landlines you must pay but to make any calls related to pc via pc is free.
I've bought Skype credits in the past (several years ago) for calling from my computer to landline/mobile phones.  If you're just calling computer to computer for voice communication or video conferencing, you don't need to buy anything.
SKype is free for pcp to pc basis but for calling pc to landline or mobile you have purchase
