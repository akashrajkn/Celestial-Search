Is LOCKERZ really worth it?
I've been doing some research up on lockerz.  I want to join but i am kinda iffy. Yes i know - i have seen the videos of unboxing on youtube.  i know its legit for them.  BUT i was reading the forum on lockerz, which google had brought me to, and they had said that even if you spend your points to buy something, you may not even get it?? Why earn so many points just to get turned down? I don't understand.  Prizes should be guaranteed.. Can anyone explain HONESTLY not with their spamming nonsense? I really would like to know.

no its not, i tried it and it was a waste of time I have 1500ptz left.. they need to get better servers.
Those unboxings arnt legit i thought about it to but if you can see where you redeem your stuff it always out of stock.Its a waste of time
Yes it is worth it! It only takes a 1-2 minutes each day to get a few points. Just check from time to time if it has prizes. 
Try Swagbucks instead. Its basically the same thing but the prizes are GAURANTEED! however it takes longer to get points (supported by google) sign up here-  http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/btgan
