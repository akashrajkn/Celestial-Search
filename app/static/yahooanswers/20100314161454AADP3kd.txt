What are the best FREE websites to create a blog?
I want to make a blog; I want it to be a good blog (I can make that happen)
but I want to have it on a good site. Any suggestions for a blog making site?
I know there's Blogger and stuff; but I don't want those sites. Any other sites?

Your only other option is to purchase a domain, pay for web hosting and install Wordpress on your web host account.
You can create a blog on wordpress.com for free. If you want to use your own domain name you can point it to your wordpress.com blog.
You could try Wordpress.com. That's a pretty good free place to start a blog.
YOU REALLY SHOULD TRY BLOGGER

I MADE THIS SITE WITH IT GIRLYGROUP.COM
Here is my list of free blogging websites:

1. Blog
2. Blogger
3. Edu Blogs
4. TBlog
5. TypePad
6. Vox
7. Weebly
8. WibSite
9. WordPress
10. Xanga
11. Webs
12. Thumblr

I prefer Blogger and WordPress, but there is no best, it all depends on your preference.
