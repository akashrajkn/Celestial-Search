Firefox Browser how to empty?
Can someone please tell me how to empty the firefox browser cache

on your browser bar, click on Tools... its pretty self explanatory from there, I think
Click on Tools, then Clear Recent History.  Set the time range to "everything", then uncheck every box except for Cache (if there are other things that you want cleared, check those boxes also), and hit Clear Now.
Go to Tools, then to Options.
In the menu, select "Advanced" then in the tabs click "Network".
You'll see under "Offline Storage" you'll be able to clear your current cache as well as change the settings for how much it stores, if anything.
If you have Firefox version 3.4 or below
1st click on Tools
2nd click on Options
when the window opens
3rd click on Privacy
4th click on Private Data
5th at the bottom click on Clear now
when window opens
6th clear or place check marks on type of info you want deleted and 
7th click on Clear Private Data Now.
For Firefox version 3.5 and higher 
Just click on Tools and go to Clear Recent History. You can then choose how much info you want cleared i.e 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, Today, or Everything. You can also choose what type of info you want deleted, then just click on Clear Now.

The link below will give you more info if you need it.
