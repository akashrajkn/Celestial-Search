what's a sweet blog name that incorporates the word aesthetics?


How about, "An Aesthetic Eye From a Fancy Guy"?

One of my favorite blog titles of all time is at phonymcphonerson.blogspot.com. (Be advised the title does include a curse word, so proceed with caution.) 

Good luck with your blog!
