Yahoo and its association with picnic.com?
Hi anybody out there using this service are there any issues regarding they wanting auto access your yahoo mail etc

Any reputable website will not require you to give them access to your account - such as passwords. You should be able to use their service without giving them the details

These are often asked for to advertise it's service to your friends - you will be responsible for their spam! So don't give them the details (same as Facebook and similar - they ask for e-mail passwords so they can send e-mails to your contacts who arn't signed up)
Picnic? If that is the photo editing site, why would it want access to your email account? From my experience, it's not a dangerous site.
