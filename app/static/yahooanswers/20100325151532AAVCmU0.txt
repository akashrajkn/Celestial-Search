Why are all these websites not working?
in the past week something weird has happened on my computer.  Most of the websites that i've gone to in the past along with others have stopped working.  When i try to go to them, either i gives me the "internet can't display this page" message or the format is all screwed up and pictures don't show up.  I thought my computer was just screwed up but when i went on my parent's computer, the same thing happened.  What's the problem? Is there something wrong with the connection? and if so how do i fix it?
thank you!

Your internet speed is extremely slow.
Try to talk to your ISP - it's quite common that your internet service provoider gives you a much lower speed than what you're paying for. Just call them and it should be fixed within a few minutes - that's what happened to me :)
Make sure no-ones using xbox live/plystation online

Make sure no-ones using any download programs like kazaa or uTorrent which take up all the 'bandwidth'

try unplugging and plugging back in your router,modem and pc
Try clearing your browser cache and see if you can get in.
