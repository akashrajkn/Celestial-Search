do you have a twitter account, & do you use it, coz i totally cant see any use to it?


yeah my bio class uses it to turn in assignments. that's about it. i tried using it outside of that but it's so pointless and nothing beats facebook
Twitter is only for people with inflated egos who believe the populous actually CARES what they're doing every twenty seconds.
Nope it's rubbish ;D

OMG THE ANNOYING ORANGE ;D I Love that :P
I use it because I am so shallow and awesome that people really need to know what I'm doing because without me their lives are so meaningless.
