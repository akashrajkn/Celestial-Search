when i start my browser-firefox-the tools,help and favourites etc at the top have disappeared?
i am no longer seeing the tool bar right at the top of my web page- the one that has things like
tools , files, help, favourites, options etc. its just disappeared- how do i get it back. ive already uninstalled firefox and reinstalled but still not there. they are there on internet explorer tho.

Press ALT + V ( both keys together)

When the menu bar comes up , select View >.Toolbars>. and double click on Menu Bar until the tick appears next to it

Or are you in Full Screen Mode ?..If so press F11 to return to normal
Right click an empty spot of the light grey area at top of browser and put a check mark in "Menu Bar"
