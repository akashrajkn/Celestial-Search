Is there a way to have Firefox tabs listed at the bottom of the browser window instead of the top?
I've heard it's easier for your computer to run one window with multiple tabs then to have ever page in its own window, but I can't seem to break the habit of looking towards the bottom of the screen to switch to another page I have open. It'd be great if anyone could tell me how to have the tabs at the bottom of the browser instead of the top.

you need to add to your UserChrome.css file to get this to work:

/* Display the tabbar at the bottom */
#content > tabbox { -moz-box-direction: reverse; }
