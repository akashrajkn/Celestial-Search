I recommend ventones too! Its a cool site. They have trailers and clear steps for all phones. 

* basically u can upload and convert any audio file into a ringtone. 
It can be an mp3 file , itunes file , or any other format

* http://www.ventones.com/video-tone

Or after u sign up , use that link to make any ringtone from any YOUTUBE video.
Really neat!
