What's your favorite and preferred web browser?
which web browser do you prefer that works best and efficiently?
Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, or any other out there?
explaining will help haha
about to download one....but not sure which one is the best for me
i have windows xp by the way; on a laptop

firefox is good for xp, it runs smooth. I liked it when I had it
IE is okay, but its not as good as it can be.
Google chrome I like as a browser it is fast, speed, very efficient.
Safari is heavy and bogs down the system especially with xp as I have had it before unless they have made it a faster browser
