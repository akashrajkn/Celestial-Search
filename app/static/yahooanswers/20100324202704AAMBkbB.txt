Is Bigspot.com a legit site?
Bigspot.com is an online survey site that allows you to make some extra money by taking surveys. I have seen commercials for them on tv and was wondering if this is one of those things that are to good to be true. I not sure if they are legit but I think they are because I saw their ads on major tv stations. plelase help.

Legitimate...yes. Worth your time and trouble...no!
I've actually tried bigspot and that was just a major waste of my time, I was making less than chump change with them. If you are 18 or older then I would recommend Opinionoutpost. It is a website that pays you roughly $8.00 per hour to take surveys. This isn't bad considering you can listen to music while taking surveys. It is 100% free to join as well as 100% confidential. Opinionoutpost will send you usually 2-3 surveys a day roughly $2.50 pay out each (and 15 to 20 minutes of work). I've been taking surveys on the internet for over a year and can tell you that this is the highest paid survey site (of over 20 I've tried) that I've ever come across. It by no means will get you rich but it is some excellent side cash. Best of luck.
