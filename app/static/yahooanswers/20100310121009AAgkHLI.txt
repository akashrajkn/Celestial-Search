Is Southeast Asia the hub for Spamming?!?!?
It seems like a lot of spam and fake web deals come from folks living in these areas

More spam originates in Taiwan, PRC, South Korea, Russia and the United States than S.E. Asia. 

Vietnam is pretty bad though. 

On most lists though, the United States tends to show up as the country that produces the most spam, beating out all Asian nations.
