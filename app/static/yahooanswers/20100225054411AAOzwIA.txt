What can you tell me about Star Trek Official Fan Club?
I have a friend who's told me that if you pay a $24.99 joining fee and stay a member for a year, you can apply for a $300 scholarship for wherever you're going. This sounds fantastic, to me, so if anyone can give me a few more details or tips on how to navigate the site I would really appreciate it. I keep getting so lost there and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

it's $500, and i'm not even sure you need to be a member for a year.  info here:

http://academy.sfi.org/student/scholarship.shtml

"Any active Starfleet member is eligible for a Starfleet Scholarship. The Scholarships are awarded in amounts of $500. Members can be attending community colleges, four-year colleges, most technical schools, junior colleges and universities or graduate school."

[note that this is not "the official" fan club, since it's not run by the studio (Paramount) or Roddenberry's estate]
