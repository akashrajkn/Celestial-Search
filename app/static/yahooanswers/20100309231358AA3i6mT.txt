How do I get comedian to notice me?
Ok, so I want your SERIOUS advice. Meaning, I need you to do some thinking for me. There's a comedian I like, I won't say who but you've most likely never heard of him. He's pretty successful online, and like most good comedians, he has a twitter. And it's hilarious. Only problem is, he never "tweets" at anybody, just writes funny things. If I keep tweeting funny things at him do you think eventually he'll notice me? Or think I'm a stalker? I just think he's the coolest and I want him and I to meet. He's not Tom Cruise but he has been in some major things. I also know he's single. Other prob-- he lives in LA and I live in NY but it's not that big of a prob....

Please help? I want to be forward with him but not stalkerish. Please don't tell me unnecessary things.
Do you think he reads his direct msgs? He has about 50,000 followers.

i think you should go for it :) what do you have to lose?
just try not to move fast lol, then he'll think stalker
Tweet him. See what happens. Ask about where he gets his inspiration, what his favorite joke or line is... People love talking about themselves as a general rule. I think it's a good opener. Good luck ya freaky stalker ;)
