If I get an account on Formspringme, will I still be able to ask people questions anonymously?
Some people on that website have their question posted on someone else's site, with their username next to it. Will that happen to me if I make an account? Because for now, without making an account no one knows it is me asking the question.

Yess. 
theres an option where it says 
"Include Your User Info"
or
anonymous.
