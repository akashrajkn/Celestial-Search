PLEASE HELP ME! *getting desperate* What's wrong with QUIZILLA?!?
whenever i try to go to Quizilla, it says the link is broken. =(
i don't know why but i'm really starting to get upset. i don't even think it's that way for everyone on Quizilla. i think it's just me.
PLEASE, i know Quizilla is really bad, and i'm not planning on using it anymore since it has been broken for TWO MONTHS now (for me).
i just wrote some poems that i posted there that i REALLY would like to have back. :(
i don't know what to do..... 
anyone else having this problem? anyone know WHY it says it's broken? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me!! :{

its not broken for me... maybe use a friends computer to get your poems back? or try using a computer at the library
