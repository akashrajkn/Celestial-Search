Sometimes items get delayed for no apparent reason, try contacting the seller to let them know that you haven't received the item. But remember, it probably isn't their fault - try and stay calm, don't demand a refund or get angry. If they don't respond, and you still feel that you are increasingly unlikely to receive your item then you should raise a dispute using PayPal, if you paid using PayPal, or the eBay dispute system.
Hi there

First of all contact the seller, give them a reasonable time to contact you (2-3 days), if not forward you concerns to paypal by opening a dispute/claim
Once done, the seller WILL need to give them the details, if they don't in 10 days they (paypal) refund you.
