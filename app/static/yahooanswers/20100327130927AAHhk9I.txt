How do I find a map of fibre optic and Virgin Media coverage in London?
It seems nigh on impossible to find a detailed map of fibre optic and Virgin Media coverage in London. I rent and actually want to physically move to an area which is covered by fibre optic. Is it possible to find a detailed coverage map online of actual London postcodes which have these services available?

well i work for virgin media networks and the network layout/diagrams are not available online.
here is something to look at http://www.samknows.com/broadband/llu-operator/virgin
also http://allyours.virginmedia.com/websales/service.do?id=2 where you enter postcode and it will show the available of the networks.
Phone Virgin Media, let them know the postcode of the area you are interested in and they will tell you
You can also do this online by searching post codes. http://www.virginmedia.com
