What's the best way of selling my music on the internet?
I'm not interested in letting Apple take a large share of money from my hard work. If my myspace, facebook and twitter pages are the hub of peoples' knowledge of my music is there anyway I can set up my own Paypal link for them to purchase the mp3s from a private server or somewhere else without losing a considerable deal of the money? 

I know it seems greedy but I think Apple and many other sellers are worse for their percentage takings.
