Deviantart isn't working for me..Help?
It hasn't been working for a few weeks now. I can't search anything unless I click a picture then search from there. When I'm at the deviations page I can't search either, I have to put it in the search bar. I can't click to go to another page either.

I downloaded Flash & Shockwave some time ago so it can't be that.

Maybe you should uninstall it then try installing it again to see if that fixes it?
