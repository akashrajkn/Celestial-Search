Haven't received Lockerz T-Shirt yet?
I made it onto the Z-List on February 22 or 23 so it has almost been a month now and I still haven't received my t-shirt yet. A few days after I became a Z-lister, I got an email from support@lockerz.com titled "Update your settings to receive your Z-List t-shirt" but when I opened the email, it was just a picture of the Lockerz logo and nothing else. The next day, I got another email from Lockerz saying there was a typo in the first paragraph in the email sent the day before, which I found really weird since there weren't anything written in the first email. Anyway, I know Lockerz is a legit site but they do tend to have a lot of flaws and such. Yesterday (March 19) was the last day for people to make it onto the Z-List in order to receive a Lockerz t-shirt. Will I still receive mine? I live in Canada, if that matters.
I updated my settings a LONG time ago, even before I became a Z-Lister.

i never recieved a z-list email telling me to update mine
Wrong. That was the last day to get something other then the T-Shirt.

Update your settings.
Same here for me. i made it to the z list around march 1st or so. haven't even got an email confirming it
so i guess this is bye bye for that tee
