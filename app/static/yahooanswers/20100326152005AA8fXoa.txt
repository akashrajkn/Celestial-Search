always spots malware and spyware sites before u enter them also. never have had a virus with this antivirus.
Here is a combination that we use for our customers computers:

1. Microsoft Security Essentials: http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/
2. Malware Bytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/
www.avg.com is good
If you are already infected, especially with that virus that pretends to be an antivirus, you need Malwarebytes AntiMalware.

It's free and available at Download.com

The virus will often block installation, so you need to boot into Safe Mode with Networking.

1) Turn off computer.
2) Turn the computer on.
3) Tap the "F8" key every few seconds.
4) At the boot prompt choose "Safe Mode With Networking"
5) When Windows loads fire up your Internet browser and go to Download.com.
6) Download and install Malwarebytes AntiMalware.  (It'll be on their top downloads list on the right)

Make sure that Malwarebytes updates itself, then run it.

That should fix it.  Most other antiviruses will not work.
