Mozilla Firefox problem.?
I have Mozilla Firefox as my default web browser. So sometimes when i go on the internet, i get this little message that says that 7 new add-ons were installed, and then my Speed Dial add-on is gone. Could someone maybe give me some insight to why this is happening? 
Please, and Thanks.
