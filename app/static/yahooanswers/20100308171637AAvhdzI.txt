what websites has video chats for free?
I was playing with chatroullete.com and I got pretty addicted. But are there other places where I can video chat with people for free?

meebo.com
oovoo.com    i love it :)
well, skype has free video chat. so does yahoo messenger.and i THINK msn but i'm not sure. hope that helps;-)
okay there is oovoo which is free as long as you don't use 3 way calling. If you use 3 way your credits that you automatically get decline and then you cant get anymore on that computer without paying. There is also Stickam.com but Stickam is more of a place for you to have a video and for people to watch you but you can still talk and they can video with you in a smaller screen. Hope this helped

It's pretty cool. You do "rounds" with strangers - in your profile you can put what you "round" for-- games (they have multiplayer games), relationships. friendship etc. You can do interactive browsing -- look at facebook or youtube together. Unlike chatroulette, you can search for people in certain areas and then invite them to round if you're interested in talking to them. 

careful, it's addictive!
