how to fix "Generic Host Process for Win32 Services encountered a problem and needed to close."?


hi there,

to solve the problem of generic host process, u need to repair your current OS.
i am not saying to format...... just repair i.e. reinstall your OS.

and then the your problem is solved as never. 

hope that helps.
If u have internet access download Trojan Scanner from the Net.It's got free trial. It should rid of the problem. However I'd suggest downloading via another comp. and install it in a flash drive. There's no problem wid direct download but it's safer the other way.ty.
