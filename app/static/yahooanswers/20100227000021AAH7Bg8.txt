What's wrong with my Twitter?
I just created a new account.
I verified it and everything.
Then I went to search for people.
It didn't matter WHO'S name I typed it, the same message appeared. "Could not find anyone named __"
I went through the Help section, and found nothing that helped me.
I don't even know how to contact Twitter and ask what's up.
So....
Someone please help me!!
I really needed this account for my business!!!

Same thing happened to me with my new myspace. I went to FAQ but its a different site so try that or email them.
To contact the Twitter staff, just go to the main home page on twitter. At the bottom, there will be several links. Just click on the on that says "Contact". On that page, it tells you how to get in contact with the Twitter staff. The related link below is the page where you can submit a support ticket.
