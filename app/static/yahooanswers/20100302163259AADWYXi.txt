Is anyone having AOL Email Problems?
Is anyone having problems with AOL Email?  So far they have lost my address book, pages fail to re-direct and emails get bounced for no good reason.  Normally it is fine but now seems to be very flakey.

NOPE ONLY YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE THAT STILL USES AOL!
Doesn't everyone have trouble with AOL. 
When I tried it it screwed up my computer for months until I was finally able to get rid of all the junk that comes with it.
Yes lots of people are having trouble accessing AOL mail.  I use imap.aol.com on Outlook 2007 and it has been sporadic for two days.  The AOL mail blog states that they have been having problems.  I was able to access it with a POP account, but I don't want to do that.
