If you want to never ever see the sun again, lose all respect for humanity, and eventually become a self-proclaimed despot of society... www.4chan.org/b/ 
I warn you... if you go there, you will only have a few weeks before you can never return to normalcy. Also, screw rules 1 and 2! Also also, the game.
Stumbleupon is a relaxing pastime and comes up with some of the most fasinating sites and you can just keep hitting stumble or you can fill out a section where you get to say what your interested in and it will target those sites.Also you can create your own page like facebook etc but much more scope for decorating your site.Heres the link~~
