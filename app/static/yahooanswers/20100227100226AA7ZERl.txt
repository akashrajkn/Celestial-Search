Which is better for playing 4od on, Firefox or Safari?
I have leopard 10. something on a mac powerbook G4 so it's pretty old :s
I am downloading the newest versions of both firefox and safari.
4od is all jumpy and stoppy, what would help this and which would be better?

You might find Firefox more effective. It is lighter weight than Safari.
