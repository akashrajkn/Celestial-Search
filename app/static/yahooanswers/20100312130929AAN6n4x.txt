How often may I tweet on Twitter?
I am entering a contest on Twitter to win a new bicycle. All I have to do is hash a certain phrase repeatedly. It is unlimited entry. I attempted to repeatedly tweet the phrase to win, but it wouldn't permit me. So how often may I rehash the phrase?

Do as many as you like, one hash tag per tweet only!
it doesn't matter how often u do,u can do as much as u want.but sometime when u tweet it hangs up so u have to reload the page,or try to give some time before u tweet again.
