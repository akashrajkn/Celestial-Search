Will My Internet still work?
I am going to set my desktop back to factory settings and i want to know if my modem and internet work without getting it hooked up again.I have east link internet, will eastlink have to come and re do my internet?

I already know to to reset my computer I already did it to my laptop.

Desktop and the Internet is two completely different thing, It shouldn't effect the other.
