FanFiction.net error. PLEASE HELP!?
I can log into my page and get into most of the features but whenever I try to access story traffic and stats, i get this message:

FanFiction.Net Error
An error has occurred while processing your request.
Please email this error message to via support@fanfiction.com.

How do I fix this?

well, did you e-mail the message?

As far as ff.net errors go, I usually find they resolve themselves within a few days (that doesn't mean that people aren't fixing them, I just don't know) If it doesn't, send the message again. And maybe again. You could try writing a full out e-mail to them.


Good Luck! (you might need it)
