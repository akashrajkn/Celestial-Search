what happened to codecall.net?
just a little while ago i went to click the bookmark i have to take me to the codecall forums , but i got a screen saying "CLOSED BY SOQOR ARMY" as well as below that "Own3d By , HACKERS PAL & Jerusalem Hacker ~" witch makes me think that its not that they own the site but that they hacked and deleted it .

heres the link to the forum if any 1 else wants to see if they can figure out WTF happened

It was hacked.
Ya man it was totally hacked by some one but I'm sure James has a back up of the site if they did delete it.  It will be back up soon.
