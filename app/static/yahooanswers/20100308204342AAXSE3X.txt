Can I switch from Internet Explorer to FireFox?
I have a laptop with Internet Explorer on it, and so does all the Desktops and Laptops in the house. I don't really like Internet Explorer, and a friend told me you can just download FireFox and it'll work. Is that true? I don't have to have Internet Explorer? Can someone tell me which is better and if I can switch to FireFox? Thanks. (:

You can use any browser you like. If you want Firefox, download it and use it.
Yes.
It's a web browser. Internet Explorer is just a small piece of software on top of Windows...There's nothing incredibly complicated that you need to do to get a browser working. So yes, you can just download firefox and it will work. In fact, you can even import bookmarks and other stuff from internet explorer.

As to which is better...Firefox is faster, firefox is FAR more secure, and firefox can be customized almost infinitely. Firefox is better in every way.
Very simple install, and it is much easier to use, Very user friendly, with many add-ons. 

Experience Tab browsing, built-in Search function, much of the same as internet explorer, just download and install and you are ready to go. Good Luck and happy Surfing.
Yes, all you need to do is download it and install it. When you start it for the first time, it will ask if you want to make it your default browser. Click yes and that's all. You can also look into Google Chrome and decide which one you like more. 

Your freedom awaits ;)
firefox = opensource  
opensource = free
free = happiness
happiness = yes
yes = =D
