Why are videos, music and pictures loading so slow on the internet?
Ok so I have internet, and it says the signal strength is "Excellent" but I can't watch videos on YouTube or see pictures on the web or listen to music on the internet because it takes an eternity to buffer, the videos and music for example, they take like a minute to start and when they do the only run for like 15 seconds and then they start loading again, what's up?

Try powering off your router and then turning it back on. It could also be that your internet speed is not fast enough to stream movies.

For running slow there are many causes:
Microsoft Registry Problems
RAM
De-Fragmenting
Etc. 

Clean windows registry can speed up the computer.
Registry Cleaner can fix your pc errors.
Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, 
download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system.
This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. 
Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.
Clean registry make pc faster.
