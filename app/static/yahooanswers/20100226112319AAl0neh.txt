Where can I sell sex toys legally online?
Well I bought it less than a week ago and it has been used less than 5 times, so its in almost excellent shape. Again, before you criticize me or call me irrational, it is too much hassle and just not worth the price, and I know someone is willing to buy it, I am willing to sell it very cheap, since it normally has a price tag of $80, I know I might be able to get at least $20. The problem is ebay and amazon don't allow this, and I don't really know any other trustworthy sites to sell stuff on like this. Again don't question me, just answer this because the longer I wait the less likely someone is willing to buy.

This is funny. Who's gonna a buy a used sex toy? Don't waste your time, keep the item.
If someone's going to buy a used sex toy, its probably going to be someone on Craigslist.

Craigslist does allow the sale of sex toys.
ebay and amazon do allow it, there are adult sections that are very well hidden on thier site.  Couldn't tell you how to get there really but I've shopped for them on both sites before.  Just go to one of the sites and look up vibrator, cock ring or something and you'll find the category.

The second link talks about the "Adult Only" category of ebay.
