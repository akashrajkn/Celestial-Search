Need some help with a web browser name?
Hi,
Can anyone tell me the name of that web browser that a polar bear as its icon? It's pretty rare it think :)

I'm pretty sure this isn't what you're looking for, but IceWeasel? It's re-branded Firefox, with a logo that might look like a polar bear if you're high or something.
