Does anyone see the cycle?
Whenever youtube/facebook/twitter releases a new layout,every teen complains about it,but when they release the next layout,everybody says that the old one(which they hated when it came out) was better.
Any thoughts?

Most people don't like change especially when they are comfortable with a layout or in general. They'll complain at first, but once they get used to it, they are able to compare and contrast.
Perhaps the layouts are getting shittier and shittier, or at least that's how they see it.
