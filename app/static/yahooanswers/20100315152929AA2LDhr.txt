Firefox V.S. Seamonkey (and others)?
Due to this post here I am now afraid of google, and also in turn I do not like firefox because they are funded by them:

So what I want to know is, since Seamonkey doesn't have the google search bar, is it safe? and if now what is? (I don't like Internet explorer, it has the bar as well)

Firefox is epic
I have been using SeaMonkey since version 1.1.10 Still loving every minute on version 2.0.3

Its a great stable browser that has a hell of a lot going for it.
The browser is simple and not overcrowded with junk
Built in Email client just as powerful as Thunderbird
HTML editor easily bash up a site in no time, Don't expect Dreamweaver standards but more then competent for simple sites
Address book (never used it)
and ChatZilla another quality client bundled in

I simply cannot fathom how sheep continue to ignore the superior (IMO) functionality of SeaMonkey and continue with Firefox that I dropped like a hot potato on release of v3.

Pretty much everything I do online is now in 1 program and not 3.. Makes sense to me.
