Do you know any horror story about stolen online pics?
people steal pics on the net all the time so once u post ur pics on the net, u never know where ur pics would end up.
Have u ever got stolen ur pics by someone on the net and had a horrible experience before?
please share ur stories. thanks.

some one i follow on deviant art was having their work taken and sold for slightly less than they themselves were selling it for and lost out on a lot of money.
This link says it all. I don't know what happened but the proof of it is here. Please note that I'd really rather not post the link, you'll see why as you read this. 
Someone posted the link on my Formspring and I answered with the following:
"How dare you exploit someone like that.
To anyone reading this don't go on the website. This person posted this link because they want to see nude pics of some girl that has a beef with the website's creator. It's a revenge website and an exploitation of the Internet for harmful purposes.
Seriously? Come on. Perv."
