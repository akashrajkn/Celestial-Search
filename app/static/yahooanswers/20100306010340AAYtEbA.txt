i hate my ex-girlfriend sites?
isn't it funny how they're the same coding, the same layout, the same exact content, the same situation (cheating)... really? are these really made by angry ex-boyfriends? or just some nerdy webmaster that owns ALL of these sites and probably makes money off these referrals. bet these girls are just random ass girls found on other porn sites.

I think they're fake. The girls in the pics are paid and the website owner gets paid per hit to the site.
i think they are all fake there trying to get ppl to go onto the site thats listed so they can get money most of them u have to enter your credit card details

so im pretty sure you want to avoid them
Most likely fake, but it is true some guys can be very mean and petty following a break up.
When they finally grow up and mature, they realize you can actually remain friends with an ex- rather than apparently being at war like the young people
Quite obviously designed to generate ad revenue. 

Sadly people genuinely are sad enough to spread the links around in the hope that they'll get to see some porn!
