Why are all my tweets gone?
Today when I went to check my profile all what I tweeted was gone! Even my followers couldnt see my old tweets, what happened? is there any way of getting my tweets back? a friend said my old tweets still show in his front page but not when she clicks on my profile! help! :( I rly want them back

It might just be a glitch, try checking it later and maybe they will come back?
Its happened to me before too :(
