How long do you think the internet will be around for?
Preferably not looking for answers like, 'many years' or 'years and years'. Twenty years? Fifty? Eighty?

Forever
Until something better comes along!
I think it will be around forever in some form.  People aren't going to suddenly stop wanting to contact each other.  I'm sure it will look very different in 10 or 20 years,
Probably forever i mean that's how people connect with each other like social networking, video chatting and that's what everything is connected to the only thing i think will change is that more and more things will be internet connected. Such as your vacuum cleaner might be internet connected in ten years or your stove will have a built in internet recipe guide.
I think that this technology will be here as long as it still provides the services needed by the mass.  If something better comes along, then it gets replaced; that will probably be the next generation of internet protocols.  For example the current IPv6 since we are running out of IP addresses.
Until 2012
