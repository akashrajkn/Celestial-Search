New report system on Chat Roulette? Oops.Someone reported you. Locked out of Chatroulette!?
Who else has gotten this?:Oops.. Someone reported you. Sorry, but you can't use the service for the next 10 minutes. And even if you type in a word such as "tits" it warns to kick you off the service. What's the deal?
No, all it takes is ONE person to hit the Report button rather than Next and ur banned. I wasn't even doing anything.

thats what u get for jerkin off on cam buddy!
The deal is exactly what it says. Someone reported you because they didn't like something you said or something, so you have to wait 10 minutes to get back on.
So much for the loose fun of the early internet.

Seriously, though, take a quick break... walk around, grab a snack, use the bathroom, check your email, say hi to Mom, and come back.
The same thing happened to me, I just waved to this person and then the same message popped up. Hopefully they figure out some new system to avoid this. Otherwise Chatroulette will be a lot less fun.
I agree it is way too easy to ban/report people. It is giving to much of the power to narrow minded people. I got banned for asking some guy and I quote "what's the image on your t-shirt?" I agree there should be a system which keeps an eye on the subject matter but this seems to be creating a problem in reverse. People are banning others just to be a nuisance.
Ya this is pretty crazy...I was only showing face. Ran into a bunch of college jerks and got reported. It has happen more than once. It is making me not enjoy the site. They need a 5 report in 5 min type system. What do you guys think?
Thank them that they just reported you, not recorded and put onto youtube
