Should I update to the latest Firefox?
I have Firefox 3.5.8, should I update to 3.6?

if you like the version you got now, hold off on it as long as possible, i use safari and accidently updated it, and i hate it
Firefox, in my experience, doesn't remove the old version. It would catch me by surprise when I open the wrong shortcut (of course, it didn't take me long to get annoyed and remove the old version).

You could install the new version, making sure to change the directory it's being saved to (it may have been a glitch for me). Then you can test if you like it, and either uninstall the old one or just horde it. :)
You can try Google Chrome, Firefox is in it's afterdays.
Firefox is the best, update it without any question.
Of course you should. Latest versions contain the latest security fixes.
3.6 also has the added bonus (?) of customised 'personas' which I find a bit tacky myself, but you might like them. And it claims to be 20% faster too, which is a much better bonus

I think you already know this link.. :) You should update your Firefox :) 

P.S Firefox has cool themes, skins and cursors.  If you want to try it:
