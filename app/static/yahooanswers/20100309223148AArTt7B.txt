What's that flash video where you upload a picture of someone and then the government promotes that person?
I found that flash video a while ago, but I forgot to save it. Basically, you upload a picture of a person, then some governmental person talks about you during a press conference. After that you see people around the city worshipping the person's picture. 

Oh, and it's not an actual animated "cartoony" video. It has actual people acting in it.
I think that it's some sort of European video.
