How to attract people who like to think to my blog?
Hello everyone, I just made a blog on blogger. Now, I'm not getting much viewers and i would like to know how i can do that. Based on the few articles I've written so far, my blog needs to attract the kind of people that like to think about anything. People that just sometimes sit down during work and just think about the world. I'm wondering how can i be able to bring those people to my blog? Can anyone help please?
