is there any websites like the  above? or which allows me to bring my own background inside or can publish my own website if i create one for free?

Web Starts has lots of options for building a site. I'm not sure if you can bring your own theme, but you can use HTML so I don't see why you couldn't use your own stuff. Here is their link, you can check them out through here: http://www.webstarts.com/?aff=Willybeansmom

http://www.freewebhosting.comxa.com/ allows you to put all of your own stuff on your website. It comes with a free website builder and templates that you can use as a basis for your site if you want to you can then edit the images etc to make the site how you want. You can even get into the html code and change that if you want.
And it is free with no ads.
