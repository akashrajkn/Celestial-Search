How can I turn on HTML on a  website?
I'm trying to buy a Wine Case as a gift for a friend from the Tesco Website and for some reason, all the pages are only viewable as basic text.....
What can I do to turn on HTML as its really horrid to navigate as is :(

This is the main tesco site, which is how the Wine site "should" look as well.
http://www.tesco.com/

But this is how the wine site is looking for me :(

This is a direct link to the site:
http://www.tesco.com/wine/

If its looking normal for you, then what do you suggest I do? I've emptied cookies and it made no difference :(

Cheers in advance,
Klis
Should have perhaps mentioned...
I have the latest version of Chrome and all up-to-date updates for most adjoining webapps such as flash etc etc

looks fine to me. Try re installing your web browser or install FIRE FOX
Be sure you have JavaScript enabled. Also, if you are using internet explorer be sure you are in the latest version which now is 8. Also, download the free firefox and/or chrome browsers. They are better. You should have no problems with those.
Tis working fine for me :|

I reccomend restart your computer. If that doesn't work, use a different internet browser (if you're using internet explorer, download and use firefox for example)

Any more assistance needed, reply/pm me.
If internet Explorer, goto to View, Style, Default Style - may work.
it looks like that because your browser didn't load the site's stylesheets so the website gets displayed as you saw it(this happens to me from time to time but I usually refresh the page and everything looks normal then);

your cookie files have nothing to do with this, instead you should clear your browser's cache.
