and also how can i get my keys on my keyboard unsticky?
oops sorry its a laptop, and its done this before when i got it new, and resolved itself,

My first thought is that you may be having javascript issues, but try unplugging the keyboard and using only the mouse.
Reinstall browser, update driver for mouse, clean the keyboard up,, using with power off of it, cotton swabs , slightly damp with alcohol  ~
Something wrong with the End Key on your keyboard ?
