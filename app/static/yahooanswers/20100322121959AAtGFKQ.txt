how do i retrieve deleted comments on blogger?
Does anyone know how to recover comments deleted in Blogger / Blogspot comments by the blog owner?
I tried using Google or Yahoo! cache but they've cached the newer versions of the blog posts with comments.
I'm trying to find a comment I know was deleted on a blog I follow.

If it is deleted and not seen in the cache, you can not retrieve it, sorry.
