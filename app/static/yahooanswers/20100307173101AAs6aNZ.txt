...Firefox or Chrome?
im on a mac running snow leopard (10.6) and sometimes have minor problems with safari so im looking to download a secondary browser. ive used firefox before and thought it was fine but never used chrome can someone with experience on either of these browsers on a mac tell me the ups and downs of them?

Chrome by far! i use it and its way faster than anything i have used!
You gotta love Firefox with all the add-ons.
I have both and they are each awesome.  If you want a powerful, customizable browser with experience, try Firefox.  Chrome is slicker and (possibly) safer.
definitely Internet Explorer 8
Chrome definately.
Use Firefox until Chrome gets into a public release stage.
its currently in beta..which means a kind of test version but still its AWesome.
Use chrome
