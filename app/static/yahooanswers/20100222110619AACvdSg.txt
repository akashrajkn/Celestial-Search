`what is a good browser besides firefox ive had nothing but problems with them lately?


Maxthon.  I use it and it rocks
I've also been having problems with them, so I switched to Google Chrome. Excellent browser, but the only drawback is, you can't use any toolbars with it.
Opera

Google Chrome 
Opera
Safari
Internet Explorer(i wouldn't use it)

I prefer opera and use it to this day. Very secure and never had a problem with it. I hear the new 3.1.0 firefox is glitchy tho so give it some time.
opera web browser
Google chrome is a simple browser so its very fast. 
There is Mac and Windows versions.

I personally like Google Chrome http://www.google.com/chrome/ the best, even better than Firefox.

Other options for good browsers include Safari http://www.apple.com/safari/ (yes, there is a Windows version of Safari), or Opera http://www.opera.com/
Awww... Annoying!

I think you should use Google Chrome, here's why:

1. The loading speed is great, better than any other browser I have used.
2. Much people say Mozilla Firefox is better, because it has extensions, but Chrome has als extensions.
3. The user interface is great, and the options menu is easy to understand!
4. It has much themes (skins), and you can, when you choose to follow the tutorials on making extensions yourself (themes are easy to make!) make themes yourself, isn't that great?
5. In the beginning, Chrome wasn't capable with much things, but now it's beginning to grow more and more capable with much things, that's why I use Chrome!

It also has one downsides:
1. It isn't capable with the toolbar download buttons on sites. (Download our toolbar!)

That's why I use Google Chrome, and I highly recommend to you to use it, too.

Good luck with searching for a new browser!
