Try AVG

Use Avast or Avira. PC World released a comparison of the Best Free Anti-Virus packages and these two came in at the top of the list. Currently I am using Avast and so far I have had no problems at all.
ClamWin is great, it's free and opensource and it's not a dumbed-down version of a good program; this is the full package. Get it at http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamwin/
