Why does my laptops Firefox browser keep saying Problem Loading Page & Server Not Found?
Odd times, one minute its fine, next it isn't. I go on my internet connection settings, and it says that i'am connected. Four bars out of five. And it seems fine, yet when I want to go on the site, it says Problem Loading Page and Server Not Found. Please help, it has happened when I want to ask these quesitions as well. Thanks : )

I have no clue. I had Firefox. I hated it, it ran slowly. So I went to Google.com and downloaded Google chrome. It works really fast. Just don't be all freaked out cause' it looks different. It works really well.
Have you tried uninstalling Firefox then install the latest version from their web site?
