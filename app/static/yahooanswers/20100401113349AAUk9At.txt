Is it a hacker on DeviantArt?
I went onto my DeviantArt account.
I noticed that my avatar pic changed to a lady gaga one.
I NEVER put that pic up as my avatar pic.
So I clicked onto it to change it back.
But when I did, where the box is to change the pic is was replaced by this in large pink letters:
TEAM GAGA WOOOO!!!!!!!11

I dont know if it was a hacker or not. WHAT DO I DO!?
They have also changed my signature & I cant change it!

I think it's an April Fools prank.
It's happened to everyone on there.
Definitely change your password immediately and check for spyware/viruses/keyloggers ASAP
DUDE THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED TO ME!!!! EVERYTHING YOU SAID HAPPENED TO ME TOO!!!! WHAT THE FUCK?
It's just an April Fool's Prank by deviantart. It happened to everyooone. It'll go away after today, hopefully.
