Where can I download Treasure Planet (movie from Disney)?
I also want to download "Dead and Loving It" (comedy with the Dracula), Iron Man, Perry Jackson & the Olympians and some other alike movies and films...
If you know also tell me the name of the movie with that guy who lives with his family as a kid and as he plays the piano his dad kicks him out of the house..., he goes to live with his music teacher and then one day in a concerto where he plays the piano he has a heart attack or something, and then he becomes crazy and he likes jumping on the trampoline like a kid with his under wears off.

Please state serious answers!

Download bittorrent. and search in google for the movie torrent.
You can buy it for $3 on Amazon.  You can't download it anywhere; that would be theft.
