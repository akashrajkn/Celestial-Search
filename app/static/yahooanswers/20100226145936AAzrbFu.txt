Is it even possible to redeem on Lockerz.com?
I sat at my computer refreshing for an hour and once it popped up that there was a redemption i thought i would be the first person, but everything ewas sold out within 5 seconds.. this website is probably shit

Not really. I tried today and did not secceed.

WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!
lockerz is kinda like a scam

points2shop you can buy your items any time for free from amazon.com with your points. lockerz you can get ur stuff once a month and you have to use ur computer the 30 seconds that redemption is open. to join p2s just go to http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=rockthat97 and if you finish any offer you will get double points for life! and also an offer may be as easy as just filling in ur email!

lockerz only has 3 of each item on redemption also
