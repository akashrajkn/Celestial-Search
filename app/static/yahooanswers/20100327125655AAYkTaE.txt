I bid the wrong amount on ebay, and now it's too late to cancel it?
So I was bidding for some BKE jeans last night-it was going to be for 9.50, I check on my account at noon today and realize I had entered 950 instead. (!) The bid time ends in 3 hours and you can't retract a bid if it ends in less than 12-what can I do???
The price of the item is 9.50 though, so would i get it for the price or for my maximum bid?
okay good! i thought you automatically had to pay for it once you won
phewww

You should try to contact the seller and explain the mistake.
opps
I think you would get it for the maximum bid, you can still withdraw you're bid, or if you win, just don't pay the person...obviously, go into your account and look around, there's a q & a thing on ebay that should help
Just contact the seller and explain the situation. I am sure they will understand that you did not mean to bid that amount for some jeans, and the seller can cancel the bid for you.
