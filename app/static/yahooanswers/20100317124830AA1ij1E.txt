Is Tweeter just a silly nonsensical waste of time?
140 char limit so really cannot say anything important. And the followers thing is just a big ego boost for those who need their few seconds of fame

It's called Twotter, dumass.
Its for the people who think their important, and think everyone wants to know that they are eating cereal...
Most everything in life is, so...yeah.
Amusing once in a while, but the whole concept of it is honestly just stupid. Who cares how every hour of your day goes. Unless you leave a magical action-packed life 24/7, just keep it to yourself, or write a book already if you think it's that great...
Some people are able to get news before the traditional news agency's through twitter, removing the middle man and the slant that they might make. 

For other people it's a fad, doing it because Oprah or someone famous is doing it.
