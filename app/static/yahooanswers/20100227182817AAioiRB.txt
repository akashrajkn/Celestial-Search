 hope it helped!
restart your computer in safe mode by pressing and holding the F8 button while computer is booting up.  next go to download.com and download avira antivirus and run a scan.  also, from the download.com website download malwarebytes and let it do a full scan.  remove all the files that it recommends.
Ok, well... don't have sex with anyone. There, that should take care of your HIV problem.
Eh, need more info please...
Drink lots of fluids and stay away from anti-biotics.  They don't help at all with a virus.

If your computer has the virus, go to www.avast.com and get the free anti-virus program there.  Follow the instructions to download, install, and run it.  It's good and safe and free.  It should do you just fine.
try norton or avg free antivirus .
