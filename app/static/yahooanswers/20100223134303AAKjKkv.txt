How do you twitpic from your phone?
I asked my friend, but she wouldn't elaborate on what she told me, and she said I'd figure it out.

But I can't.

Can someone help me?

Go to twitpic.com and then click "upload" which should be in the top right corner somewhere. It will have a number for you to send a picture message to and the picture will be twitpicked.
First click upload photo, like you usually would, then under the upload button it says: Did you know you can post photos from your phone? Just send your photos to..... 
And it will tell you what address to send your pics to.
HOPE I HELPED! =D
