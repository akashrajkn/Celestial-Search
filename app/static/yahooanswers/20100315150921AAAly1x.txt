I would suggest you check out http://pulse.ebay.com this will give you what is being most actively searched for overall. if you are just looking for good product ideas you can also use the tools on amazon that show best sellers. these will give you an idea of what is popular at any given time.
Lots of people will tell you different things. But I suggest you first check what ebay tells you are the hottest things to sell on eBay (afterall, they've got the data and the most information)

Items In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sell¡­ 

Hot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/what¡­ and select "Hot Items by Category" from the menu on the left. 

eBay Pulse = "a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. 

Merchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/cale¡­ to view the current Merchandising Calendar.
Go to http://pulse.ebay.com and you can see top 10 hot items of each category that sells on there. Good luck!
