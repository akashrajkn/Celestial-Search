my firefox back, previous, refresh, and stop button is unclickable?
Help!! I have no idea what happened to my firefox!

My Previous, Back, Refresh and Stop Button is unclikable.

They're all faded.. I tried to click so many times but... no good.  PLEASE HELP!!

have you recently installed a new theme or plug in? or maybe this is just an internal software malfunction(but I honestly doubt that) so you can try to reinstall firefox.
