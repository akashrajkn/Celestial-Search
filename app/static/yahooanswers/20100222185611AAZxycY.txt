Can you name this 4chan meme for me?
It has a chubby redhead marching band kid and then a faded image of his face over the picture of his body. Then it has a saying around it like, "We went to war to fight the monsters... now we're the monsters."

i beleve that would be followed with a traditiona "lolwut?"
If you search for it on Google and it comes up with 2 results, both being the question you asked, it's hardly a meme.
