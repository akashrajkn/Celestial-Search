Verizon FiOS VS. Comcast (XFinity)?
These are two local competitors in my area, but they are very big name companies so I am willing to bet a lot of you have the same competition. I always hear them slamming one another on the radio and TV.

Which is better in your opinion and why?

LET THE FEUD BEGIN, GO!

FiOS. No question, no contest, no argument, no feud. FiOS hands down. Fiber optic > coaxial. Also, last I knew, Commiecast liked to compress their HD channels so heavily that you could see a huge difference when comparing them to the much lighter compression on FiOS.
Comcast sucks.
