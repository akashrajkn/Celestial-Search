Need help, management implementing email monitoring system!?
I work at a gaming centre, and some of the employees use their email for personal use.
Management is now looking at implementing a email monitoring system.
May i please have some suggestions as to how this issue should be handled in terms of privacy,
the rights of the employer and the rights of the employee.

employees should not expect any privacy at work time and they should not involve any personal usage of the computer. so it is ok to apply montoring system in your workplace. we had EAM in our office and it works fine.
