What's a good website to meet people?
I really like to just meet random people for fun. I use Omegle a lot, because it's anonymous chat, but direct conversations like that can get very awkward and the site is full of people only looking to cyber. I have Facebook but don't find it's good for meeting new people. I don't want Myspace.

Are there any good social networking type sites with focus on meeting people? I'm under 18 btw.

My Year Book is the best one in my opinion. I'm constantly meeting new people there. Just be sure and not be too shy to say hello to new friends.
Ya there is our world, there is WOO ME, Gmail, yahoo, and there are many more so all those i just said are good for under 18. Theres also fantage, Marian club, club penguin. Thats all i kno of thats good for 18. So there is free realms to. And These games arent very bad. Theyr'e very addictiong and funny. there is a game called kissing at work and its so funny its on go girlsgames.com
