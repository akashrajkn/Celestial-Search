Internet in rural areas?
So i live in the country and i am on satellite internet but it is not fast enough for gaming or anything, so i was wondering do you think the rogers rocket stick would provide me with fast enough internet to play online games and how much would it cost? i have decent cell phone coverage if that helps any

you can get a 3G cell phone, and patch it into your computer
You could look into 3G usb mobile card,that has the coverage of a cell phone,there are pre-paid and contract,so check with your isp and get the best deal,using your phone as a modem can be costly if you went that way,I hope that helps.
