Youtube video to mp3 converter?
I recently got the BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH (KSOD), so i lost my bookmarks (I was able to recover my pictures, music, etc). I had one bookmark to a website that converted youtube videos to mp3. 

It allowed you to set the start/end time you wanted to download, and also the information of the file (title, artist, album...)! I think it let you download them as mp4's too.. 

Please, does anyone know what website this was? I remember the website background was black... if that helps.

Even if it isn't that exact website, can someone find one that does all of that?

Thank you so much, in advance!
I'm looking for a website, not a program
(I think it's faster/easier to do it that way)

But I already have TVC (thanks, anyway)
