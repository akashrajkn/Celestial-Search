i have a playlist.com question?
how do you delete a question on this website? i don't need one anymore and i don't want it, so how do i delete it?
i meant how do you delete a playlist??

im confused...
delete a question on playlist.com?
not a clue! 
don't worry about a question on playlist, it will probably be ignored anyways

to delete a question on answer.yahoo.com go hover your mouse over the "save" button right under the question you posted and a list of things will appear, one says "delete question", click on it
note: this only works for questions you deleted
