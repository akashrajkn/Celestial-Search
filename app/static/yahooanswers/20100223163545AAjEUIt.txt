Best Blog Site out there on the web?
Hey fellow answerers!  I am thinking about starting a "blog".  I have created my own website (www.gems-for-the-teacher.com) before and actually still use it, but am interested in an actual on-going blog.

People are always asking me how i make things, updates on classroom crafts, holidays, etc. ( I am a preschooler teacher) as well as for recipes I've made up, etc. and I think that a blog would be the best way to keep track of all of it!!  

So now the question is...what is the best "blog" site out there?  Have you/do you have your own blog?  And WHY do you think this site is the best??

I'm looking for a site that is EASY to update (editing, photos, etc.), simple in design and having some cool features would be a bonus!

Thanks in advance!
