Help with internet explorer 8 !?

Get Firefox you will never have any problems with it
If you installed Adobe Flash Player, than reset IE8 to Defaults in Options, Advanced, use ccleaner and restart PC...
Try enabling compatibility mode. It is the broken page icon next to the refresh button on the toolbar. Here¡¯s a good resource from the IEBlog that talks about compatibility mode in detail if you¡¯d like to learn more: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx 

If that doesn¡¯t work, run IE in No Add-ons Mode.  Go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) - If this fixes the issue, then go to Tools -> Manage Add-ons and enable the add-ons one by one to find which one was causing the problem. 

You can also try resetting Internet Explorer's settings by going to Tools > Internet Options and then the "Advanced" tab, and click "Reset..." 

If you¡¯re still not having any luck, I recommend you reinstall IE8 on your system.

I hope that helps!
