Anyone figured out how to alphabetize Firefox bookmarks??!?
What's up with alphabetizing Firefox's bookmarks?! I keep trying to no avail and it seems everyone else has too. Is there anyone out there who has figured this out???
Thanx!
I've been on the Firefox site including forums and have had no luck with the specifics as to how to alphabetize bookmarks. I need the exact instructions so if someone knows exactly where it is on the site; url, etc. it would be great.

Poui, I did what you specified but it doesn't work when I click on the tool bar itself. I have to do the multi step process every time I want to pull up the bookmarks. Any other thoughts? Thanks a lot.

Go to Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks.  In the left pane, click Bookmarks Menu.  At the top, click Views -> Sort -> By Name.
