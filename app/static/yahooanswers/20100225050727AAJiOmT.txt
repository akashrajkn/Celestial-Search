How   can   you   solve   this   ????????
tell   me   how   to   connect   Nokia   E63   to   bsnl   broadband   through   wifi.   My   bsnl   router   is   wireless

Sorry, your phone has no other way to connect.  Since the router has no wireless, it would be like trying to connect your phone to a toaster.  You will NEED a wireless access point (such as a wireless capable router) in order to connect properly.
