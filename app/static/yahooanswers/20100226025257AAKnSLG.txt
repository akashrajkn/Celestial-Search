How safe is to purchase e.book/courses on internet that offer 100% money back guarantee?
Is it true?
I have been told that is just another scam and that they won't be bothered to even reply to your refund request...

Has scam written all over it.
If the payment method is via Click-bank they tend to have a 60 day refund policy no questions asked.  I recently bought 2 courses off the net and paid via credit card through click-bank and found they were not what I really wanted so claimed my money back.  All was refunded within a couple of days.
