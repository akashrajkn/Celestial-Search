when i download a program it doesnt kno what to open it as, can you help?
i downloaded a game, it doesnt kno what to open it as... when i try to open it, it says the application failed to initialize properly (0xc00000135) click on ok to terminate the application
it is a pokemon program, its a game from pokemon universe... i downloaded it then clicked on it and that messaged poped up...

If soulds as if the game is compressed.  Windows XP SP2 should be able to uncompress it, if it is a .zip extention.  If any other extention you might need. 7-zip to uncompress it. http://download.cnet.com/7-Zip/3000-2250_4-10045185.html?tag=mncol it is a free download.

If that does not work then try a web search on the extention to find what program is needed to run it.
hmmm... Firstly, you didn't told exactly what extension is at the end of the program/ what type of file it is... From where did you downloaded it? What game? You should have elaborated it buddy... :) All I think is that you didn't complete the download or some file is missing...
