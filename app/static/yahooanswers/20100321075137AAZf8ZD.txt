I accidentally hid my menu bar on my browser and now I can't figure out how to get it back.?
I was going to hide some of my tabs but i accidentally clicked on menu bar instead of tool bars so now the bar that had file and tools and view is gone and i don't know how to get it back because normally I would have gone under view to do that. Can anyone please help? This is so frustrating!!

right click on a blank area where it used to be and select it again
F11 possibly?
Right click with the mouse on the browser and click menu bar and it will come back. 
Hope i helped!
right click on the tab.
then check Menu Bar.
Try this,
Press  "alt " key on keyboard. This will bring up menu bar temporarily.
click on view and select Menu bar.This step  is particularly helpful in respect of browsers other than Internet explorer.
ha ha. I did the same thing. I even tried right clicking on an empty space next to the tab or on the tab itself but that didn't work. Then I clicked "alt" and it came back up so then I clicked 
view> toolbar> menu-bar
:D
