How do you change your nickname on stumbleupon.com?
I foolishly chose my real name for my stumbleupon nickname. I would like to change this to something else now. How do I do it? Or will I have to delete my account and make a new one?

if by nickname you mean the username you use to log in, then yes you have to delete your account and make a new one. When you first sign up for an account a pop up shows up when you're filling in the username saying "be careful, this is permanent" or something like that....

here's how you delete your account http://www.stumbleupon.com/delete_account.php
