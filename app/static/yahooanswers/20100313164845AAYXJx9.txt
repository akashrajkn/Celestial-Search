how to find similar websites?
What is the best way to find similar websites?

1. go to Google Advanced Search:
    http://www.google.com/advanced_search

2. click on "Date, usage rights, numeric range, and more"

3. use "Find pages similar to the page"

If you have Firefox there is a nice add-on called SimilarWeb:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10548
