What is a good website to watch TV on?
Okay, so I found this really good website to watch TV on but an not remember what is was called, all i can remember is that it had a blue background and had about 50 different shows to watch (90210, Glee, Dexter, ect). It was really good because it took you directly to he episode rather than just loads of links, and you didn't have to fill in any silly surveys. if anyone knows the link to this website it would be great thanks. :)

Youtube or tv.com
Hulu is good, idk what your talking about but if someone gives you the name could you tell me?
