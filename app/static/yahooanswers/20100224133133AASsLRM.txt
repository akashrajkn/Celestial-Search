FreebieJeebies is an online based company that offer free gifts such as iPods, iPhones, Nintendo DS's, HD TVs, Playstation 3s and many more. They are often labelled with the online scam artists and scam websites that phish for your details but they're really nothing like that at all. Most people just assume because they of the free gifts, it works like a lure to attract naive internet users but it's really not like that.

I personally use FreebieJeebies and its very simple how they can afford to 'give away' all of these expensive items once you have been enlightened so to say. It works like this:

FreebieJeebies are partnered up with bigger companies such as Love Film (the DVD/Game rental company) who then pay FreebieJeebies a commission every time they bring in a potential customer (You!). They get paid roughly ?20 every time someone signs up to their 14 day free trial, through FreebieJeebies. Once you have signed up and completed an offer (e.g. Love Film 14 day free trial) all that is left is to refer some friends to do the exact same thing. If you was to refer two friends who signed up to the Love Film trial, this generates another ?40 (?20 per sign up, remember?). Now FreebieJeebies have got ?60 thanks to you and you can now redeem your referrals as a free gift. Get it?

For example, an iPod shuffle costs 2 referrals. You and two friends sign up and generate the ?60 for FreebieJeebies, and then redeem your referrals for an iPod shuffle. FreebieJeebies use roughly ?45 to buy you the iPod then another ?5 is used to send it to you next day special delivery so it will arrive the next day. FreebieJeebies then pocket the last ?10 as profit as they need to make some money too!

The referrals are pretty easy to get as you can start with family and friends and then branch out. To gain a referral you have to have your friend sign up to FreebieJeebies through your own special link that you give them, which then credits you when their offer goes green (Completed).

This is what your personal link looks like:

If you signed up to the link above you would be one of my referrals. When you completed an offer, you would be credited with one complete offer and I would also gain a referral for showing you the website. If you want to start using FreebieJeebies you're more than welcome to use my link, although you don't have to if you don't want to. I would appreciate it if you did though.
