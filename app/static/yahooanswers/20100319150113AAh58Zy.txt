I just bought a Domain. Now, what?
So, I just bought a domain.

Where can I get hosting for the cheapest? Are there any free hosts for purchased domains that are actually good?
Any personal experience would be nice. What do you prefer?

I have Googled but I'm overwhelmed by all the options. I'm asking what people prefer and what they trust best.

Also, whatever is the best for the least money. I'm poor. =P

There are a lot of web hosting options. A quick google search gives you this:

Godaddy is a popular option, as well as HostGator.

Free hosting sites are sketchy, and should generally be avoided.
I recommend one of these: http://www.tophostingpicks.com

iPage has the best offer right now.
Their standard price is $84/year ($6.95) but they have
a 50% sale, one year of hosting for $42.00.

Their plan includes:

Unlimited disk space
Unlimited bandwidth
Free domain name

Price: $42/year ($3.50)

They have one of the most popular hosting platforms, which currently hosts over a million websites. They're also one of the oldest hosting companies, founded in 1998.

They include a free point & click online site builder so you can create a website without any programming (easily, just by drag and drop) or you could install Wordpress (they include easy, one click install from their control panel), choose a theme that you like, and start adding content.

They also have a great custom control panel with OneClick installs of all the popular software like Wordpress, Joomla, Forums, Chat, Galleries, Online stores and a lot more.

P.S. Since you already have a domain name, you can use your free domain name to register another domain and create two websites and host them on the same account (at no additional cost).
As an experienced webmaster I recommend BH web hosting which I¡¯m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

hi,
 through out my life i've been with a lots of hosts, but the feature u must look for in a host is the Technical and Backsupport they offer, in my experience 

http://www.thewebpole.com/  offers them well and good and it is also a free hosting provider
You should go with Hostgator. I have been with them for 8 years with 100+ domains hosted.

You also should start with the best one like Hostgator. You can try them for almost free. Here is how http://cpanelwebsitehosting.com

Good luck.
