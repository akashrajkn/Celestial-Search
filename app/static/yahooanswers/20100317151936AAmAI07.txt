deleted my twitter accidentally?
i accidentally deleted my twitter account and i need it back :(
how can i do that?
is there anyway
it said restoring is not possible NOW
if so when will it be possible

When you delete an account, the site assumes you no longer want it and so delete the information from their database.  Your account is gone
Its not possible maybe you wont delete it next time
that happened to me TWICE haha i reopened
it before and now i'm trying again but it also
says its unavailable at the moment, soo i keep
checking this link, to see when its availablee ;
