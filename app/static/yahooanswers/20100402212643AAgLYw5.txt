What exactly is Formspring?
I know it is meant to ask questions, but how does it differ from Y!A?

anonymous.
formspring is a website where people can ask the person different question, and then you can answer them.

I think both are same........
On formspring, people are supposed to go to your page and ask you questions about yourself, while in y!a it's mostly informative, such as people asking for advice on things.

On formspring they ask stuff like "how many guys have you dated?" or "what kind of music do you listen to?", just for fun.

PS, I like your username. :)
