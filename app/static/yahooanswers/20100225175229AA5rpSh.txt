what kind of browser should i install? which one is the better one too?
google chrome, firefox, and are there any more

what site can i download a browser from and its legit?
like no virus, etc....

I use Firefox  and I wouldn't change 

I have used IE , Chrome  , Opera , Avant and Safari 

Google their names and go to their home page , or go to Download.com to download programs

When it comes to browsers , its all down to personal choice
Well in order of what i like best is

All of these browsers except internet explorer work for Windows and Mac

Opera - http://www.opera.com/

Safari - http://www.apple.com/safari/download/

Firefox - http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html

Internet Explorer 8 - http://www.microsoft.com/nz/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx

and Google Chrome - http://www.google.com/chrome
internet explorer also...but i recommend Google chrome because it is easy to view multiple web pages and has applications you can add onto your webpage, preference always varies among people though
Google Chrome is best.
Internet Explorer is decent also.
I dunno about the download, though.
G'day Alesana,

Thank you for your question.

It is really a matter of personal taste. I use Google Chrome myself.

In the comparison below, Firefox was rated top followed by Chrome and Internet Explorer.

Regards
I use internet explorer 8, and firefox 3.6  I would never allow any of the other web browsers to be on my computer. I have tried them all. Both of those are the top rated web browsers.
