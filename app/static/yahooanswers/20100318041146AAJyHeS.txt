How can I delete anything and everything dirty from my computer?
Or at least try? I'm a teen and I really don't need this bs anymore, I have more important things I should be doing instead and i'm becoming addicted. Besides, this laptop is used by my nosey mom too. 

I feel guilty for letting it take up so much of my time. I want to get rid of every trace possible.

Help?

Only way to be sure is to format the hard drive - Google for how to do it :)
The best (and easiest to use) tool I have found for cleaning up your computer and securely removing deleted material is East Tec Eraser.


They have a 15 day trial version, which is fully functional, so if you just want to do this as a one-off, this is the tool to use.

This tool will also allow you to securely delete files or folders you select.


Note to Firzen - formatting the hard drive does NOT remove the data - trust me, I get paid to recover data from formatted and f-disked hard drives all the time - I'm very good at it!
1. Take back up of important files in a pen drive / external drive.
2. Format the hard disk.
3. Re-install OS and other software.
low level format, it will rewrite every sector of the drive making it like it was in the factory.
