Is Dyscern a scam? Has anyone else dealt with Dyscern?
Dyscern (http://www.dyscern.com/) sells used/refurbished electronics. I made a mistake and ordered from there website without reading any reviews or researching on the company. I have read that they send out "ghost" UPS tracking devices without actually sending anything out at all.. Has anyone else bought anything at Dyscern?

Hi Alexander,

I will quickly tell you that I am not an unbiased responder as I work for Dyscern.  Not to worry, we are are a real company. While we aren't perfect, we do stand by our products with a 30 day warranty.  I have sourced our Google shopping reviews below.  They aren't perfect (we deal in used and refurbished items making misunderstandings a far more likely) but they are decent.  One thing you won't find in any of them is a complaint that we took a customers money and didn't send them an item.  I hope you like your item!
