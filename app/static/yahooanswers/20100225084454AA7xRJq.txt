Looking for new Websites about Space?
Can you lead me to sites about space, like maybe telescopes or satilites or Space shuttle veiws and cool stuff like that ??  Thanks in advance

If you haven't yet visited NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) site, give it a try. 
http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/

There is a new picture every day and you could spend days viewing the archives. One of my favorites from APOD is:

Enjoy!
