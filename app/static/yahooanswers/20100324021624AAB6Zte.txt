Why wont my Ebay photos upload right?
All my photos are lightened a little bit before being uploaded :)

-The photos just kept loading and never completed
-The photos loaded but then said they had an error
-The photo wasnt viewable, so I got the original one to upload as a test, it worked, then I flipped it the right way and it failed

Please, this is really frustrating!
Thanks so much xD

flip the photo the way u want it then save it as a different file name and use that one. Hope this helps
