How Do I get photo's from americanidol.com?
Okay, So I really really want to know how to get the photo's from americanidol.com. So I'm wondering if anyone would happen to know how I can get them? Cause, I can't save it. I can't copy it. So I have no idea how. Can anyone tell me? Thanks in advanced! :D

Click PRINT SCREEN on your keyboard, open PAINT, Click PASTE and then crop out the pic you want.
right click image, "save image as" or
"copy image"


use google chrome (recomended)
If you have a mac, try this: apple+shift+4 and it will take a photo on your screen
If you have a windows, you obviously can't so maybe download softwares for free trial like hyper camera 2. 
You can also check out the site getty images.com and maybe search for maerican idol photos.
