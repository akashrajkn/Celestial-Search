how do i narrow down a search?
When I'm searching things on the internet, I swear there's something wrong with the computer, I look up something on yahoo, yahoo answers etc, and it takes a while to find what I'm looking for. E.g. A while ago I searched up "BoA lyrics" and lots of results came up that I wanted, but now I can't find any??

Insert the + symbol in front of each word you type in the search box.
