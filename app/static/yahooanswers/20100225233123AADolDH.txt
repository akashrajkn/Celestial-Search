need help, internet trouble..?
well my pc seems to be working fine and ive done multiple virus scans and looks fine
but lets say for example im on youtube and i click on a vid, as its buffering or whatever it will take forever and after it starts playing only like 5 secs into the vid then start buffering again.. i look at my conection and its good to excellent. i think its a virus that eats up my bandwidth
any help?

This is not a problem with your internet its more of a problem with youtube. i have the same problems and its not usually on all visd but some just seem to take forever to load and buffer all the way.
Too many cookies are piling up within your computer causing an issue with your bandwidth. Simple way to fix this buffering issue.. Open web browser ---> Tools ---> internet options ---> general tab ---> browsing history ---> delete ---> delete all ---> check box to delete cookie add-ons also ---> yes ---> close internet broswer/window ---> open browser and go back to youtube. Now when you play that same video, it will play fine.
It CAN be a problem with your internet connection. Test your speeds at speedtest.net
If they are still fast, then yes, sometimes it is youtube and the server the video is located on is running a little slow.
