What do you wish you could do on the Internet?
The Internet has come pretty far in the past decade, but undoubtedly we will see even more new things over the next ten years. My question to you is: what would you like to be able to do on the Internet or on your computer, cellphone, or other mobile device that you can't currently do?

Think about it for a little bit before you answer.

Okay, let's hear your thoughts.......

I would like to be able to hold the internet in my hand on something like a PDA or more. As you can see there are already investments in smaller systems
I would love to be able to vote online.  Voter turnout would reach record highs and you would have results almost instantly.
I would like to be able to call certain people all over the world that I've connected with on YA.  There are some I feel I know well, and others I am just getting to know.  One or two I worry about.  It's too expensive and scary for some people.  I like being able to hear a voice.
