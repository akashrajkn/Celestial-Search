Hey, anyone heard of this hoax?
OK, so i got an email from a friend, and everything was similar, like her name was spelled correctly, they typed just like her, etc etc, except they  changed her email address. they took her email address (let's just say it's sbbubbles@gmail) and changed it so it looked the same, but wasn't hers. (changed to: sbbuubbles@gmail) and so the message came in as  "sally brownwell" but it wasn't her email. it claimed she was in the UK (which i happen to know Sally isn't), and was mugged and her money, both cash and credit, and her cell phone, which is why she was emailing me, because she needed help.

well, obviously i didn't give them anything. Sally's personal life is not one that would let her go to England, as well as get mugged. So i know this is obviously a hoax.

anyone know anything about a hoax like this, or gotten one like it? cause i'd love to know, otherwise i think it's sally being a witch (distinct possibility)

thanks

Yes this is such a hoax ive gotten 10 - 20 of these emails. How in the world i was getting them im not sure but i think it is ridiculous
Yeah, this kind of hoax goes around from time to time!
That type of garbage usually shows up in the spam section of my email ( at least with gmail it does ) and it's barf
