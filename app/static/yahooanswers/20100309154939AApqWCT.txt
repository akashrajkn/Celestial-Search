What to do when I've forgotten UIC's net id password?
It's VERY important for me to obtain my password for UIC's net id system! 
If I dont log in to fill in housing applications, I may not get housing.
I know my username, and I emailed consult@uic.edu for help. I only received an automated letter in return & that didn't help my situation.
So to anyone who has forgotting their Net ID password before, could you possibly direct me as to what I can do to know my password ASAP??
thank you to all who read this! :)

Just do a search for yourself in the UIC phonebook http://www.uic.edu/searchUIC.html to find your netid
If you forgotten your password go to the ACCC website and reset it.  http://www.uic.edu/depts/accc/index.html/ACCTS.html
