Is gazelle.com a scam site?
its this site where you can send in your old gadgets and get cash for it.
I've never tried it. anyone out there used this before or heard of it?

It is a reputable site; you can trust it.
I put in the specs for my old laptop, and was quoted $122.  After I sent it in, they changed their offer to $60.  They said the battery didn't  work (it worked before I sent it in), that the Microsoft key sticker was too worn (it was faded but still legible), and that the RAM was half of what it really was.  I upgraded the RAM myself to double the original amount.  There is no way to dispute their findings, just take it or leave it.  I took my laptop back and sold it on ebay for $232.  Oh, and when I got it back from gazelle, the battery no longer worked.
I sent in 7 phones. The online quote was for $170...got $182. Looks like I was a little too rough on my own grading. They were quick and very responsive. I plan on using them again.
It's legit. I've sold 3 phones from them and got the price I was quoted or better. Plus there are coupons online to get 10% more. And their customer service has been quick and helpful for me.
