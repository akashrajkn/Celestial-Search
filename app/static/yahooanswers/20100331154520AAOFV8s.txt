if i ask a question on formspring without signing in, is it anonymous?


I believe you have to be signed in inorder to ask, however, if you're not signed in and are able to ask, then yes, it should be posted an annonymous.
Yes. You are not signed in, therefore formspring has no way to ask you to sign the question you just asked.

Besides, if you're gonna talk smack, do it in person, haha :)
