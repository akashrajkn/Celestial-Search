Weebly Blog Help? (3 questions)?
Ok i have a few questions for my blog.
1. Can you make a comment box for each archive (i make a new entry each day so...) Like and have the comments show under the entries? 
2. Where can a little bar thingy that shows you how many people have ever viewed the site?
3. Where can I find widgets and so on for my blog (make sure they're free)
i'll decide on the best answer if its specific and correct. Thanks!

1. people can automatically comment on each one of your entries, so there's no need to put a "box" or something like that yourself
2. just google "site counter" or something like that
here are some links to free online site hit counters:

3. you can also look on google for website widgets ^-^
