Is a tracking number provided for Royal Mail small packet?
I bought a shirt on ebay and I was told it would be sent standard small packet from the UK, but I didn't receive a tracking number for my item.

Only if it was recorded delivery. Standard small packet would not have a tracking number.
some mail services offer tracking service(you will get tracking#)
Some do not offer tracking service(no #s are coming)
Find out how it was sent and go to....

To see whats up with the particular service.
More information is required to answer this question.

Small Packet is not a service - its a type of mail item, like letter, parcel, etc.

We need to know which Royal Mail service was used to answer.
Here's a list of the Royal Mail services that give you a tracking number -
(International)
Airsure
International Signed For Airmail
International Signed For Surface Mail
(UK only)
Special Delivery
Recorded Signed For 1st Class
Recorded Signed For 2nd Class


The following do NOT have a tracking number:
(International)
Airmail
Surface Mail
(UK only)
1st Class
2nd Class


You need to check with the seller which service they used. There is no "standard" service. This is usually a word that ebay sellers use to mean "whatever is cheapest".
