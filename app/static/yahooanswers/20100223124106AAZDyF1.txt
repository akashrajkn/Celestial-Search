OK I know I'm asking too many questions about twitter lol...?
but I'm so confused...I think I'm wording the questions wrong haha....so if you put like @then a famous persons name who isn't following you in your tweet...do they know youve posted that? do they get an email notifying them? or do they just not know about it? or do you just have to do it when you know they're on there and hope they see it? sorry if I'm being confusing :P cause like I said good luck to this famous guy doing a show then like a minute later he was like "thanks for all the good luck messages!" so does that mean that he'd seen loads of peoples tweets wishing him luck?
