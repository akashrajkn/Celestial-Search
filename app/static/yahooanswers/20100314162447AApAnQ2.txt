Sold an item on ebay and recieved payment. What next?
I am a newbie to selling. I have sold a box set dvd of a movie on ebay in an auction. I have recieved the payment but I have absolutley no idea of where to go from here.  What I thought was i would just post the item to the address with royal mail first class and be done with it. But there is stuff on paypal about tracking and postage labels. This is confusing for me???

You can go ahead and send it to their address through the post office.

You can buy postage online but you don't have to. 

The important thing is that they get the DVDs one way or another.
Just do it yourself.  It's all you need to do, and it'll be the cheapest way to get it done.
