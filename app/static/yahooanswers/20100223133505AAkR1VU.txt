keeping my anonimity with my email address?
for certain email correspondence, it is important for me that i maintain a certain amount of anonimity (nothing illegal or nasty), but for various reasons, plus I do not really like the idea of people possibly knowing my private information.  How can i be sure of keeping this anonimity and knowing that the recipient cannot know who i am, and more importantly get hold of my private information?  Can anyone help please?
