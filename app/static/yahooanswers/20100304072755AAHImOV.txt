How can I recover my hotmail email password?
I need to log onto my old myspace to delete it, but ive lost my password.
Its a hotmail.co.uk address and when I go to hotmail.com  and click forgotton password and click forgot password it says the email is wrong?

Is there a programe i could use to recover it?

Thank you,
I use the forgotten password link but when I write in my email it says its wrong, I know it's the one I used for my old myspace,

No please use the "forgotten password" option available in the website
