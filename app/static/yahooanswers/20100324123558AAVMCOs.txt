What happens if you lie about your age on ebay?
I want to sell some stuff on ebay - REALLY NEED A NEW GUITAR - but the thing is you gotta be 18. Could I just say I was 18? If so, what would happen? Would they be able to tell from my debit card or what?

What would happen if they discovered I was under 18?

If you answer me correctly with proper punctuation and answer the actual question instead of saying 'dunno' just to get some points, I will give you best answer. :)

they can just cancel your account
and bann you from getting one later
They need you to be 18 for legal reasons (if something goes wrong). While you won't really get into trouble by lying, and I doubt they have any way to check through your debit card (if they do, they will simply prevent you from opening the account with it), it would be simpler and more honest to ask your parents or other relatives to help you out.

Then again, maybe they will send some ninjas to kill you in your sleep. Yes, eBay has a secret ninja army. Don't believe me? Well it's your head...
Yes, Ebay has ways of learning your true age and they will, trust me on that.

You will not be allowed to use Ebay then.

People seem to think that Ebay is easy to lie to. They are not!

Users get suspended for this all the time.

Don't do it.

A minor is not allowed to enter into contracts. That is what an Ebay auction amounts to... a contract.

If you really want to sell, then have a parent register for you. But remember this...if anything goes wrong, your parent is responsible for it.
