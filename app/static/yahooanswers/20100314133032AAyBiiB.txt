If they're not clueless, yes.
probably not if what she talks to you under has passwords that only she knows
It depends on what program you use to talk to your girlfriend. Some programs keep logs of conversations, and if the parents find those, then they will be able to see exactly what was said and at what times.
Yes. It's called the phone records that every company sends with the bill. They can see the exact length, time, and number of who is calling and who you called.

If it's not on the bill, it is online.
They can not see who they are talking to unless they have a parental control program that keeps track of what she does on her or your computer
