does this website look shady to anyone else?
this site http://www.store.net-shopping.us.tc/     it looks sortof shady to me. i dont know wether to use it or not..they have great prices on stuff..im thinking about buying a tv from them. what do you guys think?

Past users have said that it's a scam, don't use it.
It's based in Germany according to Flagfox and has a poor reputation according to Firefox add-on WOT (Web of Trust).

I'd steer clear!
Yes it does look shady.
