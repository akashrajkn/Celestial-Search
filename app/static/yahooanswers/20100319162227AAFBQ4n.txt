Should i update my browser?
*mozilla Firefox
*Internet Explorer 8
*safari
*Google Chrome
*or opera browser

Which one is better?
and is it a good idea to update your browser or leave it like that?

Chrome. No argument.
I think Firefox, because of all the awesome applications. Or opera, which already has a lot of awesome applications built in.
Mac - Safari
PC - Firefox

ANYTHING BUT INTERNET EXPLORER.
