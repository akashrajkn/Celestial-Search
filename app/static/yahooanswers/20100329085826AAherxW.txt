Can 1-800 numbers track me down(I'm using Skype) 10 POINTS!!! To most informed answer?
Like,see my phone number,see that I'm using Skype,or see anything that they can use to get my location.(I'm using Skype)

Yes, they can and will if you do anything illegal!
Toll free numbers have Real-time Automatic Number Identification (ANI) which identifies the caller's ten-digit phone number. This means that anytime someone calls the 800 number, ANI will unblock their caller ID even if they are calling from a blocked phone number. There is no extra charge for this service and it doesn't require any special equipment.

Say you have a friend that has a 800 number for like his business.  You keep getting anonymous phone calls (your caller id just says "private").  If you can forward your number to that 800 number then it will unblock it and find out who is actually calling you.
Also works on Skype.
