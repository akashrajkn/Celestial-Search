Vista Internet Security 2010 virus?
A box keeps popping up every few minutes saying that my computer is infected with trojans and I need to buy a program to get rid of it. I know it's virus, but I ran Malwarebytes Anti-malware and it didn't detect anything. I never installed the Vista Internet Security and it's not showing up on the un-install list. How do I get it to stop?
