On twitter how do people see what you write?
For example, on Twitter Justin Bieber's fans always say "follow me" or they write things to him and then he follows/replys to them. How does he see what they write? It's not like it just comes up on his twitter home page since he isn't following everyone.

Its on the right hand side..begins with @ (your username)
Even if ur not following someone when you use @ and their username it pops up what they wrote on ur homepage
