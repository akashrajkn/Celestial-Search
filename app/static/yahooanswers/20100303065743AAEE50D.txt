which browser is the best for internet surfing?Can i download it from internet?if yes then from where?


It's either Safari or Google Chrome. Safari you get it from apple.com and Google Chrome you get from of coarse google.
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html
if you mean the best of the best and the fastest overall. its the paid version of Opera.

One big thumbs down for that is you need to pay for it once.

if u want a free browser then in my opinion, google chrome and mozilla firefox are equal.
either mozilla firefox or google chrome...
mozilla firefox can be downloaded at its webpage
www.mozilla.com
or at www.download.cnet.com or www.softpedia.com

google chrome installer can be found at above website also...
Best internet browser I think is mozilla firefox latest version.
google chrome......@ google.com
As long as it is not IE. I use Chrome, Firefox and Opera depending on what I am doing. Firefox keeps loosing my log ins for when I go to certain sites.  Chrome has never lost them. And yes I checked the save password in FF.
I also love that alot 
I've just uploaded that file below
Chrome

Simple, fast, customizable.
