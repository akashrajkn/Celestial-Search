Is the internet broken?
Is the internet broken? If so the Why?

The internet can never be "broken" it is essentially  in its own world, its probably your router if your internet isnt working.
I don't the internet is even going to catch on and become popular and widely used.
Nope....works fine at my house :)
Yes. The internet broke. Some guy came in with a hammer and destroyed the one computer that runs the internet as we know it. Nukes are launching, the zombie apocalypse is staring, and your mother is a whore. Enjoy it.
No, but the troll filters are broken.
