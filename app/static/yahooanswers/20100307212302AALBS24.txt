The Task Bar. If you right click on it you will see the answer.
The status bar is where you see a page loading and when it's done, it is part of IE.  The task bar is not part of IE and is where the clock is.  You won't see a status bar if you don't have IE window open and you may not see the task bar if you have it set to auto hide.
