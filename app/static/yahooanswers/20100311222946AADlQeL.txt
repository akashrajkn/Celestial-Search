Mozilla Firefox Question?
i accidentally got rid of my tool bar how do i get it back?
*it is the menu bar with tools, file, ect.

Right click where the toolbars normally are, and recheck the toolbar you want back
Get add-ons from mozilla website or reinstall your mozilla firefox.
Right-click on the free space under Mozilla Firefox title and set checkboxes at the required items.
On the upsite of your browser click view then choose toolbars. Then choose the one you want to place back.
