Tom, should I uninstall IE first. My IP address says that my browser is IE7.?
I do have IE8 installed and it shows in my control panel add/cancel screen. However, it does not show that I have IE7. How can my browser be IE7 if I do not even have it insalled?

Your IP address can't possibly say that your browser is IE7. The IP address is independent of the browser.

 Please add more details as to what you are trying to do, so that we can help you.
