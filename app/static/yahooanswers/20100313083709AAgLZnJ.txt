What is the best email provider?
Gmail, Yahoo, MSN, AOL, Juno, Microsoft Windows Live/ Outlook, Frontier Mail

gmail
gmail
AOL is my fave, easy to use, lots of options fast loading times. Plus using AOL lets you use AIM which is one of the most popular IM services in the world.
AOL isn't bankrupt yet? No one sane uses AOL.

Use Gmail.
You can use GMail or Yahoo since they have many features and estalished provider.
i have been using yahoo mail for at least a decade, and have always been happy with it. 
stay away from AOL, it is a virus. MSN is crap. Juno is not bad.
Gmail
hotmail/windows live, it gets you onto xbox, and msn, and other stuff like, that, it is the most common, so more of your friends will have the same one which will make it easier to chat/add them
gmail
No doubt, GMAIL !
