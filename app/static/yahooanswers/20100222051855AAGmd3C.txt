Why can't I log in to lockerz?
So everytime i try to log in, it almosts brings me in but then goes back to the log in screen and says, "you have been logged out, please try again" and i keep trying again but it never works, how can i fix this?

Same here, im guessing its still under maintenance... Just wait a little. PLAY is out like today so thats good!
I've been having the exact same problem since yesterday! They seem to be doing a lot of technical maintenance right now, so as long as you haven't done anything against the rules on the site, you should be fine. Only difference is in my case I can't sign in from one computer, but I can on another. Hopefully they'll get the bug fixed soon!
i had the same problem but i just been able to log in. i think mabey because the site hasnt got the capacity for so many pple since they just launched play mabey try on a different computer

p.s does anyone have any idea when the general redemption is?
You can really fix it. It might have something to do with the server or your account if you tried to do hacks which is aganist the rules in lockerz. I am having the same problems so you and me are just going to have to wait.
