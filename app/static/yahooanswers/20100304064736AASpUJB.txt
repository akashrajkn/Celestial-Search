What does insufficient system resourses mean?
I have a pc that is not connecting to the internet and the answer I get is the above

LOW ON RAM. Try clearing out your taskbar exit some programs. Or upgrade the ram.
It means time to buy a new PC. Your old PC most likely has no more virtual memory and/or hard drive space to cache. Its also possible that the mother board is so old it cannot run or handle newer software.
Right click on the taskbar and select "Task manager" > processes.
Check to see the resources being used at an idle. You may find something is using an unusually large amount.

This may or may not be part of a "memory leak".

I've lited a site 
Hope it helps
