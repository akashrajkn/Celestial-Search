Engrish? Whats that?
youre confused, Engrish is a real linguistic phenomenon that happens when a non English speaker(usually one of Japanese or other asian language) mistranslates in English

look it up on wikipedia
WHAT'S IT SOUND LIKE?  english.  in like a chinese accent or something.  not really all that hard to figure out..
its americans funny way of making fun of asina pronunciation.
I believe is when someone is mocking another person of their accent or of their mother tongue not being English, and they pronounce English as Engrish.

Engrish is the sometimes comical way that non-English speakers mangle the language.
Hey Taiyo,

Engrish is a slang term which refers to poor-quality attempts by Japanese writers to create English words and phrases; whether in mistranslation of an original Japanese language text, or in an attempt to create an original text in the English language. The Japanese-specific terms Japlish and Janglish also exist, although they are much less common and typically considered more derogatory. It is also commonly used with reference to any East Asian language, not necessarily Japanese.
winner is you
This should answer your question and make you laugh:
