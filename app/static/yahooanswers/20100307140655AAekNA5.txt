Free Website Hosting?
I plan on eventually putting a game hopefully MMORPG, also have an image/message board on it, adds don't really matter as long as they don't get to much in the way or lag my site, and I would like to have a slightly remember-able url.
I looked at free-webhosts and I'll use that resource is, yola doesn't pan out, and I don't want a forum I want a message/image board that you don't have to log into and can jsut post as anonymous

Check out http://free-webhosts.com
Free web hosting sucks. Just buy one. They're terribly cheap nowadays.
Try Yola: http://www.yola.com

Im not sure if it will work for this though but i think its worth a shot and its free :)
I hate when people do that if he want to pay for it he/she would have asked for paid hosting any way. if your looking for forum hosting.

I use http://www.forumotion.com ~ It has a great support site and the admin panel interface is clean and easy to use.
