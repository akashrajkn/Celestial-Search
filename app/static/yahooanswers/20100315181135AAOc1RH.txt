Paypal Sending Limit?
For you who have exceeded your Paypal sending limit, is Paypal going to send you a new 4-digit code for confirmation purpose through your credit card billing before you can send more money? If it is true, how long do we have to wait for the 4-digit code to come/appear on our credit card billing?

You can view it online in about 4 days or call you bank and ask for it.
