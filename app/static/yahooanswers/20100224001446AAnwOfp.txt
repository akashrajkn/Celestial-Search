If I have a protected Twitter acct, can celebrities I follow see what I tweet?
I want to protect my tweets from noisy friends. Can I tweet without the  @ function and my tweet will still be seen by the celebrity or do they have to follow me inorder to see any of my tweets that don't include their name in it. Like I tweet "I had a good day" and tweet "@kobebryant I hope you had a good day." Can he see both tweets or just the message directed to him even if I am following him but he is not following me.

if they're not following you , then they cant see what you tweet (unless you put the @name on, obviously). I'd just carry on tweeting whoever and whenever you like & tell your nosey friends to bugger off!! xx
