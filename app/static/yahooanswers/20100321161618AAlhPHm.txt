Can the virus 'Vista Defender Pro' be transmitted by USB keys?
I recently got the virus Vista Defender Pro (which is a fake anti-virus program that pretends you have a lot of viruses, and tries to make you buy an upgraded version of it to get rid of them, and slowly infects your computer unless you delete it) on my laptop, and although I managed to get rid of it, while it was still on my computer I backed up some files on my USB key. Is it safe to put my USB into a computer, or will it get the virus?

I am a local chinese buy agent, i can do purchase for foreigners with chinese items to help their small business or daily life use,things could be from taobao.com and other china online shopping sites or china wholesale market or directly from factories.www.taobao.com is the biggest C2C online shopping site in aisa,it is just like another ebay,you can find cheap brand cloths,shoes,bags there,some are the order rest from china OEM factory,and some are 1:1 highly alike replica. If you are interest in this area, can give me a email: wxcansen@hotmail.com for further chatting.
Hope it helps!
