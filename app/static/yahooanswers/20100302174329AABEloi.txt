No it will not but if it is in the app store it should unless they make a port for it on cydia or rock (which you need jailbreaking for) Try this if you want cydia and rock www.blackra1n.com
BOLT runs on any J2ME based device. Unfortunately iTouch have no Java Support. BOLT may support other platforms in the future.
