does it count as a download when you watch things from utube?
i no longer have unlimited downloads and i was wondering if watching movie clips off u tube or imdb counts as a download because watching bbc iplayer and channel 4 od is.

Streaming is as same as downloading. It definitely counts!
Yes it does, cos you can see that it have it collect the info first so you can watch it ,so yes it will count as a download towards you account
yes ofcourse,

because your video is being buffered which is as good as being downloaded.
