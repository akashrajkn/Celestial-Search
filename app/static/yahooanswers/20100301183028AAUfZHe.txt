Will downloading Mozilla Firefox slow my computer? What are the benefits of it?
Will it take up a huge amount of space on my computer? Why should I download it?

it will slow your computer , not a lot but some.
there really are no pros about it just a internet that  has a lot of updates and if you dont update it cuts you off. 
if your downloading a internet you should download google chrome.
hope i helped
It won't take up a lot of space and is better than internet explorer, however I prefer google chrome as it is a smaller file and runs way faster than firefox. You should either download it or chrome and stop using internet explorer.
Your computer might be fragmented, this can cause your computer to become slow overtime. If you were to defrag your computer hard drive chances are it would run as fast as when you first bought it.

I suggest you defrag your computer, here is a tutorial that will explain how (With screenshots!)
Also if you download a load of stuff defrag right after you have!

If your PC is running slow and you want to make it faster, I recommend you to check your pc heath online first, then you can know why it is slow
 and  fix easily..

it depends on your computer. if you have a dual-quad core it should run fine

if you are using a single core you might want to download Google chrome, it runs better on slower/older computers
