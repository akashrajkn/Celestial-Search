Help on firefox web browser.?
I have managed to somehow remove the toolbar along the top of my firefox internet bowser. It's the toolbar which has the file, edit, view, ect. I would know how to view all my toolbars but the view button is gone. Thank you.

setting top right corner
Hold  ALT key and press V ...once it appears click on View , select Toolbar and make sure Menu Bar is ticked
Try hitting F11 and see if that solves your problem. That made my FF go full screen and I lost that as well. F11 toggles the view.
have a look at these..
