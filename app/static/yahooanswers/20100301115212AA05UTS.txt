Are "Get your free [INSERT COOL GADGET HERE]" ads legit?
I never actually thought of clicking on an ad supposedly giving out free stuff, assuming it was a scam. But I was on facebook just now and saw an ad giving out free mac laptops for testing and thought to myself, I could use a mac right now.

Anyway the site is colormyrewards.com and it appeared to be legit. What I want to know is this. Are free give-away ads real? Are there strings attached? And would I really get a mac if I entered my address on that site, or would I just get a ton of spam?

I mean, the company had to pay facebook to have their ad there....and I trust facebook...so by association......ya I'm just a bit confused. Help?

Thanks

Yes, most of those companies are legitimate. The manufacturers give products away for marketing purposes. Sometimes you have to take a survey or fill out a questionaire to get the free item.
