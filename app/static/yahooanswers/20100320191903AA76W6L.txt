Ustream Instantly Crashes my browser?
So, I've been trying to broadcast some game-play on Ustream for a while now, but every time I try, with any browser, Ustreams broadcaster instantly crashes it. I've tried Google Chrome, Firefox, I think IE, but nothing's worked. Does anyone know why it does this, and if there's a way to fix it?

Thanks.
