Is there anyway to get someone kicked offline off everything completely?
Is there a way someone can get someone else kicked off the internet entirely without getting in trouble?

No. How in the world is that supposed to be possible? The Internet is an open network...no one person or body controls it.

The only way I can thing would be for the person to end up in jail.
No, even if you bombed their computer, libraries schools all have the internet. Unless you took the internet out worldwide lol  ( which you cant )
