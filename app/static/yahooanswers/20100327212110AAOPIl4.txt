What's better? Myspace or Facebook?


Hmm Facebook cause it has more games then Myspace =)
I've gotten over myspace. I used it in middle school, and I use facebook to contact my family members, and such.
Depends how old you are.
Myspace is now for like immature middleschoolers.
Facebook is more toward mature highschoolers/adults.
Facebook all the way!
facebook because myspace is getting kinda old...
Definately Facebook. You get a lot more interactivity, its easier to find contacts, it has basic but enjoyable games and applications.. and its easy to keep track of your own contacts and their status. Basically it's just a whole heap easier to use, cleaner to use and enjoyable when using
Facebook is WAY better because MySpace is LAME! :)     I don't know about Sypke but, I bet it's popular too!
I know I'm probably gonna get thumbs down for this, but I like Myspace more.
