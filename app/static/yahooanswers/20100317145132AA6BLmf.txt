Nickname/handle ideas?
Alright folks. 

I'm deciding on an internet handle. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then this will just be a nickname question for you.
I want to pick one that fits me, but I really can't decide between a few.

So far I like:
Coffee
Clockwork
Barrette
Tailor (my favorite name is Taylor so it's a play on words ;3 )
Arcadian
Bosky
Bandit

Which do you think sounds best? "I haven't seen ______ around lately" is a good example sentence to say.
