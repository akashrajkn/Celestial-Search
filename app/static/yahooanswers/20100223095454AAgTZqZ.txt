What should my blog name be?
I really want it to be unique, attention grabbing, original and overall something that really represents me in a few words.

My blog is lostly goign to be about me ranting about things in politics, media(with celebs), things happening in my life and thats about it...

So Far I have thought of a couple of names:

unleashedpen
liberatedstatue
cagedbird

things about me can be included;
i love music, painting,  sketching,  swimming, colours and shoes lol


those things can be added or we can go with teh original stuff havign to do with being free but at the same time confined by other things around you or something... havign to do with how powerful writing is.. 

if you guys can come up with anything on your own that would be good :)

Thanks

How about Star Fighter, Crystal Imagination, or Local Motion. The three you wrote probably would not attract a lot of people, except maybe radicals.
