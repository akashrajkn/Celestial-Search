Should we send(upload) a little piece of work to the hirer about the job for which he wants to hire someone, if he doesn't ask in his job description ?

That's a great idea, especially if it's the actual fruit of your labor that employers are really looking for like a painting or model or something. I don't think I would send it to them without warning, though, but that's just my opinion (they might just delete it if it has attachments they don't know about). On your job application, resume, or just in an email to them, you could add a note that your work/portfolio is available to be sent to them at their request in the form of photos, a Powerpoint, etc. This way they should be looking forward to receiving examples of your work. Good luck, anyway!
