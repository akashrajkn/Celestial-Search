I need Twitter help!?
How do I tag someone on a tweet? Like I've seen people and they say @BLAHBLAH is amazing. I want to know how you do that? Might be a stupid question but I just got Twitter.

Plus would anyone like to follow me on Twitter at (@sparkleozzy) or give me your URLs and i'll followw you.

just click the retweet button or reply button, a reply will give you @whoever your replying to then your message, a retweet gives you @whoever twits you want to retweet to your followers... they are found at the lower right of each tweet...

the "@" is the tag, you can either click reweet and it will add it for you, or you can type @theusernamehere to mention them yourself
