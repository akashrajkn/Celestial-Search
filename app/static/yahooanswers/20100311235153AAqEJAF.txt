Lockerz Alt F4 cheat, does it work?
My buddy told me about a cheat on Lockerz where you click Alt F4 when you finish writing a daily but not submited yet. He told me he did it and got 400 PTZ. So, does it work for real and do you lose your account for doing it.

pressing alt and F4 will shut down the browser you have open. your buddy is a jerk. try it right now, see what happens.
