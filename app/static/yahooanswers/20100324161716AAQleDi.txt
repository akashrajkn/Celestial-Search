Don't we use the internet because we don't want to see commercials?
now I see commercials, advertisements WITH SOUND, pop ups, google ads that you can't skip on youtube, and banner ads EVERYWHERE you look.

why are these everywhere? 

computers are supposed to be a step above television, now it is just as bad?
I don't want apps to block ads.

You can use AdThwart or AdSweep if you're using Mozilla FireFox, Opera, or Google Chrome.
Like television, radio and before that the telegraph - putting a web site on the Internet isn't free. Never was. Never will be. You might be able to put a few pages on the Internet on sites that don't charge YOU, but it's costing someone somewhere.

There are computers to run, and computers aren't free - nor the electricity and people to monitor and maintain those computers. The buildings housing the servers/people aren't free, either.

You're paying your Internet Service Provider to connect to the Internet with the computer you bought, with an operating system you paid for.

If you want something that's commercial free, I suggest you buy a book - for a nominal fee, of course!
