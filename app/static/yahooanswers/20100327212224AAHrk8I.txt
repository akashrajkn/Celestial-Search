What are some good web comics?
I read/enjoy SMBC, Nedroid, Gunnerkrigg Court, xkcd, and some other stuff and I just wanted to find some more good webcomics :)
I like anything that is funny or has a good story...

If you don't already read it, it's a must.
Penny Arcade is one of my favorites. http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/
"She Died in Terrebonne" a sort of murder mystery, following a detective from japan: http://www.agreeablecomics.com/kimimura/?p=9

"Dr McNinja" the adventures of a ninja doctor, who is Irish. http://drmcninja.com/issues/

"Rice Boy" and also "Order of Tales" read rice boy first http://www.rice-boy.com/

"Sam and Fuzzy" one of my favorites, you'll wanna start at volume 1, or zero if you want http://samandfuzzy.com/archive_story.php

"Waspisquare" gets into Aztec stuff, kinda fun comic http://wapsisquare.com/comic/09092001/

"World Wasn't Meant" pretty funny hijinks of two guys in Boston http://www.worldwasntmeant.com/

"Pictures for Sad Children" another favorite http://picturesforsadchildren.com/index.php?comicID=1

"My Cardboard Life" funny one, made of paper and cardboard! http://mycardboardlife.com/2008/10/08/paper-scissors/

"Minus" another favorite, it's amazing http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus.html
(they have the other comic "Great" there too, it's also good, check it)

"Hark a Vagarant" pretty funny too http://harkavagrant.com/

"Gunshow" funny, especially 'The Anime Club' small series on it http:// gunshowcomic .com/
(i had to break up the last link because you can only have ten at a time)

there's others but I'm lazy.
