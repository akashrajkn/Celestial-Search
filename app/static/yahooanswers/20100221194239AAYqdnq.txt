Is there a way to make VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls for free?


No, but a magic jack is $40
yes, use yahoo messenger, it can call your friend yahoo messenger for free.
computer-to-computer is free, e.g., if you both use Yahoo IM.  Computer-to-phone is not free, but Skype is SO cheap, I recommend it.
