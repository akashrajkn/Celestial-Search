Can't reactivate my Twitter account?
When will the new account restoration process for Twitter be available?

It's been like that for some time now. I don't think that Twitter is compromising a new way to reactivate accounts. If so, it might not be for a while. Check their "help" website. I'm pretty sure it mentions why they won't reactivate new accounts.

Goodluck! :)
