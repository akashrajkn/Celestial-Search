Do you know about any legit chat rooms?
I'm not looking for sex, just something to do while I'm bored. I remember when Yahoo chat and other chat rooms were abundant with real people and not bots. Know of any that are still good? Please don't give me any riddled with bots or full of perverts please.

well, how old are you? when i was around 16, habbo hotel was my favorite website ever. haha 
its a virtual chat.but if youre older, then it might be a little dumb, since the only people i remember using it were 12-18..
Try IRC chat.
