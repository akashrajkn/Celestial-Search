What could this pop up mean?
i was on youtube (not important) and a little box popped up (it looked like a small internet explorer window) and read "hi". that's all it had, so i pressed ok and it went away and nothing else happened. ??????????????

that what happened to me too.. only on youtube.. but im using a mac so i think its normal.
I have no idea what it means, but scan your computer for viruses, just in case. It's possible that it installed a virus, even though it's unlikely.
it's usually a sucker move to install malware. I suggest you run a full scan with your anti-virus
Yes it is Malware, When you are on the internet you can get a lot of pop ups so its actually normal.
It just happened to me (I'm on a Mac).
