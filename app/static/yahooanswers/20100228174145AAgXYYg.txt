Internet connection on laptop?
My laptop says I have a connection to the internet but when I open my browser it says I have no connection. Any suggestions?
Also, I have a connection on my desktop using the same router.

If you're running wifi on vista/xp you can going to network & sharing connection, then try repairing.
If that doesn't work try disconnecting & connecting.
If that doesn't work try checking your router, it probably has a plug loose that barely passes a signal.

Answer mine?
