Limewire legal action?
how can I stop someone who is uploading private pictures to limewire with phone number and home address and email address on the pictures [adult pictures]  OMG????? What can I do? I don't have limewire and don't want to d/l it. I know its true, I got an email from someone asking stupid abusive horrible stuff. Yes its an ex boyfriend. But I need this stopped!

All I can say is contact the Police and or a Lawyer....It will most likely take legal action or it may even be a criminal offense...

Other than that, there isn't much you can do as it is being "Hosted" on your ex's computer and Limewire is only acting as the "middle man"...They are the ones telling where it is at and then those who download it are getting it straight from your ex's computer (or any other folks who have already downloaded it and have it in an open folder that Limewire is allowed to put on their list of files for download).
