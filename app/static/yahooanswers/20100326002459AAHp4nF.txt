Most of browsers available today are free.Mozilla is Open-Source so they have double benifit of Contribution from the community and gets money from Google because of Revenue deal(You refer your browser to our service we give you money).Opera is not open source but earns money through revenue deal with google.Internet Explorer is made by Microsoft so obviously it aims for Bing and helps bring some money.Not sure about safari but apple must have some sort of revenue deal.
