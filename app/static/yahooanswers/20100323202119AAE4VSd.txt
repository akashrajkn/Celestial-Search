What is the fastest internet browser?
The only ones I have are Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. But, which internet browser is the fastest, out of EVERY single one of them?

Firefox
CHROME! It's the best trust me...just try it out its super fast
well i have used alottt of browser in my internet surfing day haha. and well i have to say i have been using Google Chrome lately and i have to say it is by far the best browser i have used it has a nice basic [modernish i guess] style and you can use diffrent skins etc. and well its amazingly fast which is a ++. so i say GOOGLE CHROME WINS!! if u dont like chrome do firefox but STAY-AWAY from internet explorer what ever you do haha.
Firefox of coz
I've really only used Internet Explorer and Firefox, but a couple weeks ago I downloaded Google Chrome and I have to say that it is definitely the fastest one I have used so far.
