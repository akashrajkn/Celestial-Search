How do You find a order reciept online?
i went on toys n joys .com and bought 3 things but when i want to track my order from usps it says enter the reciept number so how do i find it after i X'ed out the page that had the number?

Well normally they ask for your email address, so, if they did, check your email and it will probably have an online receipt.
You could also go to your history and go the page with it, but that might not work.
