Can you help me with firefox?
Okay, I can start firefox, I can get to websites, they will seem like they're working, then firefox freezes and I have to end the program through task manager. I have cleared out everything. Please help me fix this! It has always worked fine, and now I'm stuck using internet explorer which I'm not fond of! Thanks

I'm sorry. If it doesn't work out, may I suggest Google Chrome, Opera, or Safari? They are very fast, especially compared to Firefox.
First of all, did you try re-installing it? That can sometimes work. If you did, then there could be a virus possibility, in which case you will have to update your antivirus program and then scan for viruses. It could also be your registry. Download a program called "ccleaner" from www.download.com and run a registry scan with it. Or it might be your hardware. Does it only happen with firefoc, or with other programs as well. I know that any of my programs that access the H: Drive crash immediately because there is a problem with that drive. You might want to get someone to look at the parts of your computer/laptop if it is over a year old.
Hope I helped
That is indeed odd behavior for Firefox.  I know it's a pain but have you tried uninstalling, reboot, and reinstalling firefox.  Perhaps an incompatible plugin got added that is causing this. Probably couldn't hurt to do a quick scan to rule out trojans/virus's as well.
my suggestion is to switch to a different porvider like explorer
Try updating to the latest version: 

Start firefox
Help
Check for updates. 


Also, firefox is the fastest browser i thought? cnet.com thinks so.
