Netflix Problem--Help!?
When I try to watch a Netflix "Watch Instantly" Movie on the computer, it works well for about 5 seconds, but then it quits and a message pops up: "Media Playback Error/ Error Code: 
N8156-4001/ We were unable to load this title for playback." etc. Here's the thing--I have used Netflix' instant streaming service for over 2 months and have never had a problem like this before. The day before this happened I watched a movie that was two hours and ten minutes long. The next day I tried to watch a two hour movie, and this happened for the first time. Now every single movie I try to watch, even a 20 minute TV episode, this same thing happens. Has anyone had a problem like this? How did they fix it? And please don't suggest calling customer service--already tried it and they said it was my internet connection which makes no sense at all.

I'm getting the same thing, but with no luck thus far as to how to fix it.
