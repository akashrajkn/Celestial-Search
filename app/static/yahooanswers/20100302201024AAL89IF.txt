What is the point of twitter?
you can't do much on it so why is it so popular

Because people like to stalk their friends and know what they're doing 24/7.
I dont know. I dont understand it either. Its useless if you ask me.

I can see if ur famous or something and have a bunch of people out there that are always wondering what you are doing..


ugh.
ill stick with face book and myspace
You just practically update your friends on what you`re doing. It`s popular because you`ll know what other people/celebrities are doing. So yeah.
because people feel special when they know things about others. seriously. that's really all it is. 
it is kinda funny how many people actually believe they're following celebrities around through it, though  :)  
unfortunately, facebook is implementing the same device, so everyone is stuck with reading about their friend's colonoscopy because they have to tell everyone about it from their &*$% cell phone. 
...and somehow through a sociological phenomenon twitter is popular for this.
