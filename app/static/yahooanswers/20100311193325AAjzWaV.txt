What's another good way to look for someone you lost touch with?
I'm looking for my 12-yr old niece who lives in the same state as I but different city/county, whom I haven't seen since she was very little.  My mother suffers alot because she hasn't seen this granddaughter of hers either for the longest :(
Other than Facebook, is there anywhere else I can look?  I'm hoping we don't have to "pay" to find her, is this possible???
Thx for any & all suggestions~

aim myspace and twitter but other than that idk
Public Records - if you know the mom or dads (special the dad) last name start a city by city phone # search.
