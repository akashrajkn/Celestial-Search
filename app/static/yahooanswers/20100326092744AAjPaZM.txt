I tried hundreds of free proxies/vpn's over many months. All I got out of it was a lot of frustration as they got blocked in short order. Well I got one more thing and that was a virus from one of them that wrecked my HD. Even when they worked for a while they were slow and didn't support all the web site features. My friend in Riyadh told me about the Personal VPN http://www.surfbouncer.com.  He's kind of an expert on unblocking sites because he lives in a place where pretty much everything fun is blocked.

Anyway, I tried it a few months ago and it's been working all the time. I haven't been blocked since and the sites are 100% functional. With the Personal VPN everything works like it's supposed to. Once connected you don't even know it's there. It's not free but it works perfectly.
((( surfxmatic.info ))) is the best unblock site ( for me and for all my friends ) that include a large list of fast, free, new, and working proxies that up to date every 30 minutes , you can using it to bypass your school filter, access and unblock all blocked websites ( i believe that : Surf X Matic is smarter than any smart web filter )

Good surfing
where is my vote ?

Cheers...;)

You can try one of the links below. They're pretty new so they should work in most places, they work with facebook, myspace and youtube and have no download limits.
