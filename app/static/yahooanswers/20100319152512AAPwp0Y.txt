how do you @ someone on twitter?
im trying to @ reply someone on twitter... how do you do it?

type @theirname.
 if using twitter on cellphone and you dont want anyone else to read what you say to them, type D theirname and then your message. that is how you direct message on twitter via cellphone.
Just type in @username, and twitter will figure the rest out.

Be careful that you make sure it's their actual username and not their display name, and that the names are case sensitive; otherwise you'll be sending messages to the wrong person.
You type @ and then their username, following with the message. You can also go to their profile and hover over one of their tweets; click on the 'reply' and type your message.
