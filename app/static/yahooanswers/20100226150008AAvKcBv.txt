I Want To Be Able To Watch HULU Online Shows But I am In Canada? It Won't View TV Shows If Out of the USA!!?
I live in Canada and the HULU website prevents streaming of online tv shows.  How can I circumvent this restriction?  Someone mentioned the program FREEGATE once the mask your IP.  Will this work?

Move to the USA.  US copyright law prohibits exporting of these TV shows.  Sorry.
