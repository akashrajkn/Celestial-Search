How can you find someones email address?
like can you look it up by searching their name? please help thanks

If it's to do with yahoo answers, then click their name. If not, then there is no way of searching their name and finding their email address. Sorry about that
It depends on what name they used when they created the email address. Not everybody tells the truth when creating an email address. Personally I use at least 6 different email addresses. One which is purely for personal use and never gets posted anywhere on any sites. Others are used for sites requiring a point of contact like YA, Facebook, internet forums etc and none of those can easily be traced back to me or to my home address. There is a fairly good "people search" engine which can be found here: http://www.ehow.com/tag/pipl.com/
