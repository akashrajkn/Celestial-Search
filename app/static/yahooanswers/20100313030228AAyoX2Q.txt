Would you tweet a burglar telling them you're not home?
Stupid question, but hundreds of people do it every day
Burglars are constantly monitoring twitter to see what Moron voluntarily tells them they are not home

Typical tweet:
I'm at IHOP, I'm at the station, I am a Moron

lol
Haha. Good point.
The bad part is, people do that and don't even realize what they're doing. I saw one time where this guy would watch the obituaries of rich people then go rob their homes while they were tied up with the death in the  family.
