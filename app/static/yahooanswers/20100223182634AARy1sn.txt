Recently when I open Firefox or Internet Ex. I have a box right in the middle of the screen that wont close...?
it doesn't happen with Google chrome. Is Google messing up my Firefox? If anyone has suggestions I would really really appreciate it!!
alright... its an empty white box that goes all the way across the screen. at the top theres a Blue line that says 'click here to close box' then theres a box you click..but when you click it the page just reloads

sigh...what kind of box, how would we know what to do if you don't even describe it
Sounds like spyware to me....try downloading and running Spybot.  You can google it.  All the best!
