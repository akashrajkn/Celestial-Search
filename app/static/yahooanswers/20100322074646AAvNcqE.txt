Broadband contracts . Need advice on the best deals in U.K. ?
What if the difference between unlimited downloads and unlimited usage ? Can you recomend any good providers ? I have always just used B.T. but lately they have got expensive it is costing ?172 a quatre for my phone line , bradband and calls. I do not make many calls. Thanks.

I just changed to plusnet - give them a phone and they'll go through it all with you, what package would suit etc.  BT are thieving crooks.
