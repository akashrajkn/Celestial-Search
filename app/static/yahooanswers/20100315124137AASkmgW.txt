What does dd stand for?
I started playing this MMORPG called Luna Online about a week ago and while I was blasting lizard men, a guy requested a chat thingy. The first thing he said was "wanna dd with me?"

heres what I got from urban dictionary:

You should have asked him when you had the chance. I've never heard that before on any online game I've played, so I'm either too inexperienced, or that was a game specific acronym. Go into the game chat area and ask what dd means, and someone will tell you. Just a guess, it could have something to do with dungeon exploration.
