Removed "vista security virus" but IE and Firefox won't work!?
I used Malwarebytes as it is recommended by a lot of people. It didn't complete the job, so I used Superantispyware as well. That seems to have done the job as the crazy pop ups and warnings are gone.

But now as I try to use my computer(after restarting and everything) Internet Explorer, Firefox, Skype etc. simply don't work. When I click to start those, it gives me the "open with" window every time. Only if I right click and select "Run as an administrator", it opens up like it should.

But it is not normal. I shouldn't have to do it every time! Is the virus still there then?

Please advise.

Thanks guys for your help. That's what I wanted to do right away but thought there might be a way around it that I don't know.

The challenge I have is the windows CD, I lost it. I have the serial number etc., but my research showed that I cannot reinstall without the CD. Will contact the manufacturer's office first thing tomorrow morning. Don't know if I will get any positives.

Appreciate your help guys.
